[04:33:14] <Lajjla> J'aime manger des escargots.
[05:12:23] <David> man I need to get a car
[05:13:02] <Lajjla> You must live in the united states
[05:13:15] <David> I just don't get why people are actually willing to sit three-abreast on a second row of a compact car for hours
[05:13:21] <David> but a bunch of my friends actually did that
[05:13:35] <David> Lajjla: yep
[05:13:54] <David> (and it's not for want of cars either... some people had cars, albeit old ones. But they'd rather cram into a tiny back seat than drive themselves)
[05:28:08] <Trynity> I'd much rather do that tbh
[05:28:12] <Trynity> I dislike driving
[05:29:22] <David> Trynity: trust me, it's unpleasant
[05:29:32] <David> I was seated in the back seat of a prius for one hour
[05:29:46] <David> with two other people
[05:29:49] <Trynity> I've been like that, too
[05:29:53] <David> none of us were fat (actually, the guy in the middle was super thin)
[05:30:02] <Trynity> It's fun if you have stuff to talk about
[05:30:05] <David> I will never do that again.
[05:30:08] <David> and yes, we had plenty to talk about
[05:30:31] <David> bt
[05:30:35] <Trynity> I guess you just don't "get" it
[05:30:51] <David> but*
[05:31:03] <David> it was a long trip
[05:31:20] <David> there were a bunch of cars
[05:31:21] <David> adding one car would still have meant all the cars had 4 people in them
[05:31:25] <Trynity> I've also been on long trips like that
[05:31:44] <David> plenty enough to talk with, and when reception isn't crappy, you can always link them all with cell phones
[05:32:45] <David> anyway Trynity 
[05:32:55] <David> you have a much higher tolerance for discomfort than I do :)
[05:33:09] <Trynity> It's because I didn't grow up in a posh atmosphere
[05:33:53] <David> >posh atmosphere
[05:34:04] <Trynity> Niqqa you grew up in a mansion in the bay area
[05:34:11] <David> I'll have you know I'm an ordinary middle-class american who grew up in an ordinary suburb
[05:34:20] <Trynity> Your friends were driving a prius
[05:34:25] <Trynity> Pretty posh tbh imo fam
[05:34:26] <David> >mansion
[05:34:26] <David> lol
[05:34:26] <David> top lol
[05:34:31] <David> >prius
[05:34:33] <David> >posh
[05:34:35] * David falls over laughing
[05:34:58] <David> it wasn't even the nicest car in our group
[05:35:19] <Trynity> I'm not going to say anything, but rather have you keep digging your grave
[05:39:47] <David> well Trynity 
[05:39:51] <David> see #personalfinance
[05:40:20] <David> still inconclusive but seems to be leaning towards 'not posh' :)
[05:40:46] <Trynity> Ah, yes, let's look to a channel literally full of rich people
[05:41:24] <David> >literally full of rich people
[05:41:24] <David> name one
[05:42:43] <David> also, the prius price, as I pointed out there, is on par with the accord and the camry
[05:42:47] <David> which are pretty much standard non-posh cars
[05:43:23] <Trynity> denali1 :^)
[05:44:34] <David> Trynity: denali1 has said that he's only got 2-3M USD
[05:44:44] <David> and http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Charles-Schwab-study-6-million-wealthy-bay-area-sf-7245880.php
[05:44:47] <David> I rest my case
[05:45:35] <Trynity> >denali1 has stated that he's only got 2-3M USD
[05:45:38] <Trynity> David senpai
[05:45:55] <Trynity> I think being a millionaire is rich, no matter your local cost of living
[05:46:31] <David> ah well
[05:46:37] <David> no sense beating sense into senseless folk ;)
[05:46:50] <David> once you get to 1M you'll see how little it actually is
[05:49:31] <David> ok, how about we ask #gaycafe
[05:49:41] <David> definitely not a "rich" channel, even by your demented standards
[06:15:56] <David> LOL
[06:16:09] <David> Ted Cruz just named a VP running mate
[06:16:09] <David> and of all people
[06:16:19] <David> it's Carly Fiorina, the clueless HP CEO with no government experience
[06:16:34] <David> I guess "outsiders" are all the rage these days

[14:37:24] <Lajjla> Oh wait, I get it, you're from the US.
[14:37:32] <Pomegranate> Privileged
[14:37:36] <Lajjla> THere's some law out there that white people can't get dreadlocks, something about cultural appropriation hatecrimes.
[14:37:54] <xanzul> chocolate sphincter? wtf
[14:38:11] <Pomegranate> Also my hair is too short

[15:06:03] <Pomegranate> Sure
[15:06:47] <Lajjla> Pomegranate, but that's cultural appropriation.
