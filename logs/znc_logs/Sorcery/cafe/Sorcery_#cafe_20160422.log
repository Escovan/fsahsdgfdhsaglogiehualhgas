[13:46:06] <Lajjla> Hmm, interesting
[13:46:15] <Lajjla> Ahh, you dos til swear at me.
[13:46:17] <VerifiedShitlady> I was first diagnosed with dysthymia
[13:46:20] <Lajjla> I was afraid you didn't like me any more.
[13:46:24] <VerifiedShitlady> Then with mdd
[13:46:25] <VerifiedShitlady> Also
[13:46:39] <VerifiedShitlady> When I was first diagnosed, the DSM IV was being used
[13:47:03] <VerifiedShitlady> DSM V is fairly recent
[13:47:05] <Lajjla> The good old days when being turned on by shit was still a disorder.
[13:47:51] <VerifiedShitlady> I was taught dysthymia was more mild chronic depression
[13:47:57] <Lajjla> VerifiedShitlady, anyway, yous till wanna spoon.
[13:47:57] <Lajjla> Hmm
[13:47:58] <VerifiedShitlady> and mdd was more intense
[13:48:14] <Lajjla> I was thought the main difference was that dysthimia is more constant and not affected much by external factors
[13:48:26] <Lajjla> taught

[22:52:24] <Lajjla> VerifiedShitlady, I'm debaging the stupid masses on r/linux about security.
[22:52:25] <Lajjla> You/
[22:53:32] <Ccomp5950> chances are you are debating a bot
[22:53:37] <Ccomp5950> or an astroturf shill
[22:54:15] <VerifiedShitlady> Kek
[22:54:22] <VerifiedShitlady> I don't reddit
[22:54:27] <VerifiedShitlady> Voat or gtfo
[22:54:42] <Ccomp5950> voat is still around?  Figured it died too
[22:55:29] <VerifiedShitlady> Voat has better mods than roddet
[22:56:17] <Ccomp5950> By what metric is that figured?  My understanding of it is the modluminati jumped on voat and registered a bunch of whatever the hell voat calls "subredits"
[22:56:35] <VerifiedShitlady> Subvoats
[22:56:54] <VerifiedShitlady> And by the metric of my personal interests
[22:59:09] <Lajjla> What's voat?
[22:59:16] <Lajjla> Can you debate the stupid masses there?
[22:59:21] <Lajjla> I love debating the stupid masses, it's addictive
[23:00:12] <Sutch> like a lower pop but still shitty version of reddit
[23:02:36] <VerifiedShitlady> It's like reddit
[23:02:48] <VerifiedShitlady> But with less condishuns
[23:02:50] <Lajjla> Ahh, no censorship
[23:02:53] <Lajjla> Excellent
[23:02:57] <VerifiedShitlady> P much
[23:03:01] <Lajjla> subverse eh
[23:03:07] <Lajjla> That ind looks like a reddit cloan
[23:04:07] <Lajjla> THat does seem like a cool iea.
[23:04:12] <Lajjla> VerifiedShitlady, anywa,y you still wanna cuddle?
[23:05:35] <VerifiedShitlady> Yeh
[23:05:57] <Lajjla> VerifiedShitlady, but it's not tomorrow any more.
[23:06:37] <Lajjla> This voat site is such a reddit clone, my god
[23:07:55] <VerifiedShitlady> Yes it is
[23:08:41] <Lajjla> VerifiedShitlady, so why do you no longer hate me?
