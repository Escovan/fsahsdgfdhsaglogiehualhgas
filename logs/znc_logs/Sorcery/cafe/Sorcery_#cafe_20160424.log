[22:06:30] <Demisedulous> Is more than penis in the vagina
[22:06:37] <trapped> does that appeal more to you
[22:06:38] <Demisedulous> it's a full body experience
[22:06:50] <Demisedulous> a deeper connection between two people
[22:07:05] <Demisedulous> Your senses intertwine 
[22:07:09] <trapped> damn Connor weed is even legal in ur state, smoke some and chill

[22:07:31] <Demisedulous> So,
[22:07:33] <Connor> yeah exactly trapped
[22:07:34] <trapped> thats an improvement since last time
[22:07:37] <Connor> I can't do any more than ask
[22:07:40] <Demisedulous> when trapped says you fuckin fuck a lady
[22:07:41] <Demisedulous> you do it
[22:07:41] <trapped> yeah
[22:07:42] <trapped> well
[22:07:44] <trapped> technically

[22:07:48] <trapped> right pomegranate 
[22:07:49] <Connor> I could fucking rape her yes
[22:07:53] <trapped> yes
[22:07:54] <trapped> i support that

[22:08:14] <trapped> imma add her and ask for nudes
[22:08:19] <trapped> won't make your name
[22:08:26] <Demisedulous> She's a virgin by choice, trapped
[22:08:31] <Demisedulous> you'll prolly get a middle finger
[22:08:42] <trapped> Demisedulous: who, pomegranate? top kek
[22:08:52] <Demisedulous> Like she's enough of a virgin by choice to tell that to everyone 
[22:08:55] <Demisedulous> connro's crush
[22:08:58] <Demisedulous>  not pomm
[22:09:01] <trapped> damn
[22:09:03] <trapped> thats crazy
[22:09:12] <trapped> stay away from crazy ass virgin by choice
[22:09:13] <Connor> she's also apparently a lower classmen
[22:09:15] <Connor> I found out recently
[22:09:19] <trapped> a what
[22:09:20] <Connor> sophomore, not juniopr
[22:09:24] <Connor> er, junior
[22:09:27] <Demisedulous> She's so afraid of gettin fucked that she tells it to every guy who gives her the time of day
[22:09:31] <trapped> for a second i thought you meant she was some kind of peasant, Connor 
[22:09:33] <Demisedulous> hence why connro knows she's a virgin
[22:09:39] <Connor> i don't think that's it Demisedulous 
[22:09:48] <Connor> our conversation lead in a direction where it was relevant tobring that up
[22:09:55] <trapped> Connor: is she pretty
[22:10:00] <Connor> she is beautiful
[22:10:09] <trapped> the she must have been raped and abused by some uncle
[22:10:12] <Demisedulous> Do you wish to hold her hand, connro
[22:10:13] <trapped> thats why shes scared of dick
[22:10:17] <trapped> then*
[22:10:29] <Connor> no you fucking idiot
[22:10:31] <Connor> jesus fuck
[22:10:41] <Connor> I don't think she's ever dated someone long enough
[22:10:45] <Connor> to consider sex with them
[22:10:57] <Connor> obviously she wouldn't fuck someone after 2 weeks
[22:11:00] <trapped> maybe shes waiting till marriage
[22:11:01] <Connor> of dating
[22:11:04] <Connor> I doubt it
[22:11:13] <trapped> i would fuck someone after 1 day of dating
[22:11:24] <Demisedulous> Ya know
[22:11:27] <Demisedulous> I would too
[22:11:38] <trapped> funny how different it can be from males to females amirite
[22:12:29] <Demisedulous> hrmmm
[22:12:30] <Demisedulous> Connor
[22:12:35] <Demisedulous> I thought for awhile now
[22:12:38] <Demisedulous> and I have a gameplan for you
[22:12:50] <Connor> do share
[22:12:55] <Demisedulous> Okay
[22:12:59] <Demisedulous> there's two ways you can go about this
[22:13:03] <Demisedulous> both may be fucked, though
[22:13:12] <Demisedulous> since you blew your load early and asked her out on messenger
[22:13:13] <Demisedulous> but
[22:13:18] <Demisedulous> there's still a chance
[22:13:19] <Demisedulous> so
[22:13:22] <Demisedulous> either you
[22:13:23] <Demisedulous> A
[22:13:33] <trapped> should've asked her out IRL
[22:13:35] <trapped> imho
[22:13:39] <trapped> but i am biased
[22:13:46] <Demisedulous> Find a party, go with her, have fun, then let the tension build while you cuddle with her
[22:13:53] <Demisedulous> No pressure to sex
[22:13:56] <Demisedulous> just cuddling
[22:13:58] <Demisedulous> or
[22:14:01] <Demisedulous> this one is less likely
[22:14:04] <trapped> cause i hate talking with people irl thru the internet
[22:14:09] <Demisedulous> you go to her house or invite her to your place
[22:14:12] <Demisedulous> and play games with her
[22:14:13] <Demisedulous> coop games
[22:14:16] <Demisedulous> have fun
[22:14:29] <Demisedulous> then wind down with a movie, invite other friends to make it less awkward
[22:14:44] <trapped> i mean it'd be easier if we knew what ur town looks like
[22:14:50] <trapped> u could for example
[22:14:57] <trapped> get some weed and get to school prepared
[22:15:14] <trapped> the day ends and everyone is rushing to get home
[22:15:16] <Connor> yeah I think weed with ehr is a really good idea
[22:15:24] <trapped> you ask her to come behind the school or some shit to smoke some dank weed
[22:15:40] <trapped> she agrees, gets high and sucks your dick
[22:15:51] <Connor> i like your plan B demq
[22:15:53] <Connor> er
[22:15:53] <Connor> Demisedulous: 
[22:15:55] <trapped> it has almost worked out for me
[22:16:07] <Connor> I think smoking dank weed and video games is a good idea with this particular girl
[22:16:11] <Connor> she enjoys both weed and games
[22:16:15] <Demisedulous> yep
[22:16:17] <trapped> except the girl was a fucking heroin addict and she asked me to give the stuff to her for free in exchange for a bj
[22:16:19] <Demisedulous> Imma genius 
[22:16:29] <trapped> so you tried weed out Connor 
[22:16:34] <Demisedulous> A BJ ain't worth that, dog
[22:16:43] <Connor> was going to on 4/20, but I did other things instead
[22:16:53] <trapped> Demisedulous: in fact i got the bj first, then asked for the money anyway
[22:16:56] <Connor> a BJ is worth little to me
[22:17:11] <trapped> lemme just share with you a pic of what i did on 4/20
[22:17:16] <trapped> which btw in italy is 20/4
[22:17:20] <trapped> such a shame
[22:17:49] <Demisedulous> Only BJ's I've gotten have been nasty
[22:18:17] <Connor> what about the one girl in the woods Demisedulous 
[22:18:26] <Demisedulous> There were no BJ's
[22:18:34] <Demisedulous> just fingering/handjobs/titjobs
[22:18:45] <Demisedulous> small tits, it was saddening
[22:18:57] <Demisedulous> and she was fucking discharging something
[22:19:05] <Demisedulous> cuz my fingers cemented together afterward
[22:19:06] <Demisedulous> s
[22:19:16] <Demisedulous> and her underwear had bloody/yellow stains
[22:19:21] <trapped> Connor: part 1 https://a.uguu.se/bsdlsm.jpg part 2 https://a.uguu.se/dpksiz.mp4
[22:19:22] <Demisedulous> the nastiest kind, ya know
[22:19:29] <Demisedulous> like she had been aborted the day before
[22:19:49] <Connor> momentary moment, watching my nerd show
[22:20:02] <Connor> also that's pretty normal for a girl on her period Demisedulous 
[22:20:20] <Demisedulous> It was n a s t y
[22:20:32] <trapped> n a s t y   A F
[22:20:50] <Connor> I don't mind period blood my self
[22:20:52] <Connor> like

[22:20:56] <Connor> or dick
[22:20:57] <Connor> that's alright
[22:21:04] <Connor> it's just blood and other gross stuff
[22:21:13] <Demisedulous> THat's how you get aids, dude
[22:21:15] <Demisedulous> like literally
[22:21:22] <trapped> ye

[22:21:26] <trapped> besides
[22:21:30] <trapped> its full of bacteria
[22:22:00] <Connor> that's irrelevant in every way Demisedulous 
[22:22:13] <Connor> if the girl has an STD then you're fucked anyways
[22:22:13] <trapped> u gotta stay safe Connor 
[22:22:20] <trapped> if the girl has an std u dump her
[22:22:29] <trapped> it means she fucked some nigger
[22:22:35] <trapped> or she got it from her mother
[22:22:41] <trapped> who must've fucked some nigger
[22:22:47] <Connor> why are you a racist piece of garbage
