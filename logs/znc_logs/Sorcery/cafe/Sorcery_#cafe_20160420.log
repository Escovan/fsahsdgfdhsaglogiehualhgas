[00:06:12] <Trynity> Now I'm at some kinda chocolate lounge owo
[00:06:27] <Trynity> Done passing out resumes <3
[00:06:30] <Trynity> Gotta do a few online tho
[00:08:21] <Trynity> Also, David, that Farm Burger place only accepts applications through Craigslist
[00:16:15] <David> >through craigslist
[00:16:23] <Trynity> Yea nigga
[00:16:27] <Trynity> They super hipster
[00:19:17] <David> and no, I don't know what farm burger is
[00:19:55] <Trynity> I walked in and there was pictures of cows everywhere
[00:19:57] <David> oh, lol, way out west of me
[00:19:59] <Trynity> Photos of them
[00:20:09] <David> too far for a burger place
[00:20:10] <David> got enough good burger places in walking distance
[00:20:13] <Trynity> And everyone that worked there looked so stereotypically vegan
[00:20:25] <Trynity> Also they were playing The Velvet Underground
[00:20:29] <Trynity> My kinda place tbh 
[00:21:00] <David> Did you apply to any place where you could advance?
[00:21:43] <David> something like a sales job, or an administrative assistant
[00:21:50] <David> has a bit of a higher ceiling
[00:22:05] <Trynity> Not really tbh
[00:22:20] <David> Why not?
[00:22:21] <David> Worth trying, at least.
[00:22:40] <David> Car dealerships need sales reps and there's more room for advancement
[00:22:54] <Trynity> First there's not really much around here
[00:23:01] <David> also business sales, etc. Not sure what the certification process is for realtors, but there's lots of room there
[00:23:04] <Trynity> It's mainly just a bunch of small businesses
[00:23:14] <Trynity> I did apply to some jobs where I could advance to store manager at most
[00:23:19] <Trynity> But there's nothing really corporate
[00:23:57] <David> So what's your long term plan? does it include college or grad/professional school? Corporate ladder? Entrepreneurship?
[00:24:16] <Trynity> College and Entrepreneurship is a def
[00:24:22] <Trynity> Just don't know how, when, or what

[01:49:46] *** Quits: VerifiedShitlady (pomegranate@sorcery-apsk2s.e3bq.7bqj.fb90.2607.IP) (Quit: I meant it when I said I wanna get well!)
[01:49:52] <David> the latter is supposed to be very similar to rotmg
[01:49:56] <David> steam only though
[01:50:01] <Malroth> how is starbreak doing? and, hm i'll check it out then
[01:50:34] <Malroth> you in the beta yet for steambirds, btw?
[01:51:16] <David> no
[01:51:21] <David> I don't play non-web games
[01:51:23] <Malroth> ah
[01:51:30] <Malroth> in rotmg, the now big thing is multiboxing yet again
[01:51:40] <David> I actually have a steam key lying around for starbreak
[01:51:46] <David> but I don't have steam
[01:51:59] <Malroth> except this time it's multiboxing in shatters
[01:52:38] <Malroth> so starbreak is doing very well then?
[01:52:47] <Connor> why would you not play non steam games david
[01:52:48] <Connor> I mean
[01:52:49] <Connor> web games
[01:52:51] <Connor> inparticularwhy
[01:52:53] <David> too lazy
[01:53:01] <David> and I don't want to spend much time for games
[01:53:04] <Malroth> geez, seriously I need to buy a charslot soon
[01:53:06] <David> got better things to do with my time
[01:53:17] <Malroth> given as how I have dropped csilk doku and ray I kind of need to make a ninja now
[01:54:25] <Malroth> wow, starbreak got polished
[01:56:28] <Connor> maybe i should check it out
[01:56:30] <Connor> I like a bit of polish
[01:57:09] <Malroth> rotmg is polished
[01:57:15] <Malroth> the community isn't, but the game is..
[01:57:52] <David> for Bolto: http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/concept-creep/477939/
[01:58:24] <David> really good article
[01:58:51] <Malroth> still waiting for my jugg drop
[01:59:04] <Malroth> then probably quit unless I get more slots; jugg and 2k basefame
[01:59:16] <Malroth> 1758 base atm.. and I have ray/tablet event uts. slap in the face
[02:01:56] <Malroth> David: you ever hop on rotmg for a bit?
[02:03:25] *** Quits: Sutch (Sutch@the.ebony.tower) (Quit: -)
[02:04:34] <Trynity> Does Ray drop?
[02:04:54] <Trynity> I haven't been on since it was cheated in
[02:05:10] <Trynity> Actually, it might drop from that eye dragon thingy
[02:05:20] <Trynity> I have Cheater Armors tho :3
[02:05:34] <David> Malroth: no
[02:05:39] <David> I gave away all my accounts
[02:05:46] <Malroth> ray is whitebag from eye of the dragon now
[02:05:53] <Malroth> what were your accounts again?
[02:07:03] <Malroth> tarbomb, and?
[02:07:06] <David> iirc, tarbomb, davLd, ilel
[02:07:18] <David> I had a bunch of others
[02:07:19] <Connor> guess what I've been doing with my time Trynity 
[02:07:27] <Trynity> Getting laid?
[02:07:33] <Connor> yes
[02:07:34] <Connor> but also
[02:07:35] <David> couple of tarmules too
[02:07:37] <Connor> watching dragon ball
[02:07:40] <Connor> the original one of course
[02:07:51] <Connor> rare for those things to go hand in hand huh
[02:07:53] <Trynity> Never cared for it
[02:07:58] <Connor> it's my childhood show
[02:08:02] <Connor> dragon ball kai was
[02:08:08] <Connor> watching the original to get a better feel for the story
[02:08:40] <Malroth> ah
[02:08:59] <Malroth> just did a duo trench, fun
[02:09:13] <Trynity> Malroth play Starbreak
[02:09:15] <Trynity> It's good
[02:09:17] <Trynity> I swear
[02:09:39] <Malroth> i play occasionally, will soon
[02:09:50] <Trynity> Good, good
[02:10:04] <Malroth> 1762/2k
[02:10:41] <David> oh btw, my paper got accepted
[02:10:54] <Trynity> Congrats on the PhD
[02:11:00] <David> ....
[02:11:00] <Malroth> PhD already..?
[02:11:02] <Malroth> uh
[02:11:07] <Trynity> :^)
[02:11:19] <David> no
[02:11:23] <David> Trynity is just talking out of her ass
[02:11:23] <David> as she always does
[02:11:23] <David> paper, not thesis
[02:11:43] <Malroth> of course
[02:11:52] <Trynity> What is your thesis going to be on? The effects of metal spoons on caviar taste?
[02:11:57] <David> ....
[02:12:09] <Trynity> So I was right!
[02:12:13] <David> Don't know yet, people generally don't do thesis proposal until third year
[02:12:52] <David> I'll probably do some smoothed analysis (essentially some fancy averaging stuff) or complexity theory
[02:12:53] <Trynity> I expect something nonsensical
[02:13:29] <David> well, I can explain smoothed analysis without too much background
[02:13:42] <Trynity> Ching chong ding dong?
[02:13:46] <David> you've solved systems of linear equations before, right?
[02:13:56] <Trynity> No lmao
[02:14:00] <David> wot
[02:14:01] <Trynity> Do I look like a nerd?
[02:14:14] <Bolto> Yes
[02:14:17] <David> how the hell did you pass the SAT without that
[02:14:17] <David> did you ever take algebra?
[02:14:28] <Bolto> David most people here never do that
[02:14:41] <Trynity> I did take alg but I was trash at it
[02:14:46] <Bolto> At most it's simultaneous linear equations
[02:15:12] <Bolto> Never worked a matrix in my life
[02:16:21] <Malroth> wat's you get on SAT tryn?
[02:16:30] <Trynity> 1880
[02:16:46] <Trynity> What about you, nerd?
[02:16:50] <Malroth> 1990
[02:16:55] <Trynity> FUCK
[02:16:57] <Trynity> OFF
[02:17:04] <Malroth> CR/M/W, what scores?
[02:17:13] <Trynity> Also disappointed that I didn't get at least 2k

[02:21:18] <Trynity> Wait I'm confused why so many numbers
[02:21:24] <Malroth> 3 takes
[02:21:26] <Trynity> Oh did you take it multiple times?
[02:21:28] <Trynity> Ah
[02:21:30] <Malroth> 2080 superscored but still no fucking 2k
[02:21:34] <Trynity> I should retake it tbh
[02:21:50] <Trynity> I took it on no sleep, no study, and 1+ years out of school :3
[02:22:13] <Malroth> uh, isn't it only the new one now?
[02:22:37] <Trynity> Yea
[02:23:03] <Trynity> Also David, the reason why my math score is so shit is because of Alg
[02:23:13] <Trynity> Numbers and Operations I missed 1 question
[02:23:21] <Trynity> Geometry and Measurements I missed 1
[02:23:30] <Trynity> Data Analysis and Statistics I missed 2
[02:23:34] <Trynity> Algebra I missed 8
[02:24:18] <Trynity> My writing was shit because of those goddamn obscure clever grammar rule sentence thingies
[02:24:33] <Trynity> I missed 1 improving paragraphs question
[02:24:39] <Trynity> 3 for identifying sentence errors
[02:24:44] <Trynity> And 7 for improving sentences
[02:24:48] <Trynity> Krill me tbh 
[02:25:42] <Malroth> 50 questions on my 710

[02:25:53] <Malroth> aka 510/600

[03:12:40] <Malroth> rotmg is getting boring
[03:12:50] <Malroth> like, I can finally say i'm good at the game, I guess
[03:12:57] <VerifiedShitlady> Hi Malroth 
[03:12:58] <Malroth> maxed 8/8 fresh with an uncommon pet
[03:13:00] <Malroth> hey pom
[03:13:22] <Malroth> so like, i'm good.. idk what else to do. 14 year old me couldn't get 1/8 and now i'm 8/8 easy.
[03:14:11] <Connor> yeah
[03:14:14] <Connor> once i reached that point Malroth 
[03:14:21] <Connor> I considered my self done with the game
[03:14:22] <Connor> well actually
[03:14:24] <Connor> when i got the coral bow
[03:14:24] <Malroth> like I started on new account (kalandra)
[03:14:27] <Connor> i considered my self done
[03:14:34] <Malroth> http://www.realmeye.com/graveyard-of-player/Kalandra
[03:14:39] <Malroth> graveyard says it all to me I think.
[03:14:48] <Connor> my graveyard tells me that i suck ass
[03:14:57] <Malroth> old graveyard was awful dude, 200 deaths before a 1/8
[03:15:16] <Malroth> this time? 8 deaths before a 4/8, that died, now 8/8. and most of those deaths were for unlocking
[03:15:31] <Malroth> but yeah Connor, it's nice to actually know you can say you're good at realm. you know? actually able to rebuild all you want.
[03:15:42] <Connor> yup, it feels great
[03:15:46] <Connor> my friend kyle is the best rotmg player I know
[03:15:48] <Connor> demipony, that is
[03:16:01] <Connor> i don't know if anyone tops his skill and prowess
[03:16:12] <Malroth> crown, fancy
[03:16:16] <Malroth> obligatory zxcv
[03:16:51] <Malroth> I think when you can consistently and easily max characters from fresh you can say you're good at the game.
[03:18:22] <Malroth> personally to me atleast Connor: i'd say zxcv and cryophile are also amazing at the game. tossup between the two for me. 
[03:19:13] <Connor> totally blanked on those guys
[03:20:07] <Malroth> zxcv is the mafia dude, and cryo is #rotmg active in the past
[03:20:35] <Connor> oh yeah, I know who they are
[03:20:45] <Connor> I still hold a brotherly respect for demi
[03:20:59] <Connor> I think the fact that he has only died once per year for two years with regular play, doing the most dangerous things you can
[03:21:03] <Connor> is what impresses me
[03:21:31] <Malroth> most of my deaths nowadays are basically "complete bullshit" if I can say that
[03:21:46] <Malroth> ice sphere falls under bullshit
[03:22:01] <Connor> my deaths are my idiocy
[03:22:05] <Connor> mostly me attempting to learn how to rush
[03:22:50] <Malroth> my goals for this warr are simple: 1. get crown 2. get jugg 3. get 2k basefame
[03:23:04] <Malroth> 3 is a joke i'm at like 1750, jugg will happen with time and crown is just rng. 
[03:23:16] <Malroth> I can do shats, never got a shat ut before but i've had ridiculous rng
[03:23:46] <Malroth> a shatters I did yesterday, was doing bridge guardian, had the luckiest loot in one bag since release: ggen, cosmic, ubhp
[03:23:59] <Connor> juggs do not exist
[03:24:00] <Connor> in rotmg
[03:24:06] <Connor> i'm convinced they accidentally took them out
[03:24:46] <Malroth> they ever fix the ggen + jugg trick?
[03:24:51] <Malroth> wherein you ggen speedy then jugg armored?

[03:56:34] <Connor> i think he'd rock your world
[03:56:40] <Malroth> the other 3 days are being hidden from us: all four are occuring at once. we are being deprived of 3 days and we are being educated wrong as a result.
[03:56:47] <Connor> imagine having all that power fucking you in the ole starfish
[03:56:58] <Malroth> education is stopping us from realizing the four day thing. and i am not kidding.

[04:05:25] * David is going to vote for Gary Johnson
[04:05:29] <Trynity> >tfw carson will never sleep during your brain surgery
[04:05:35] <David> Clinton is tolerable
[04:05:44] <David> Trynity: no, you mean carson putting you to sleep
[04:05:49] <Malroth> to be fair David
[04:05:50] <Connor> clinton isn't even a person
[04:05:53] <David> he saves money by having no anesthiologist
[04:05:53] <Malroth> unless you make 10mil or some shit
[04:05:53] <David> he just talks instead
[04:05:54] <Connor> she just does whatever is popular
[04:05:59] <Malroth> atm 250k is 33%, 37% with sanders
[04:06:06] <Malroth> 500k 39.6% to 43%
[04:06:09] <Trynity> He's not the anesthesiollogygangknist David 
[04:06:15] <Malroth> it's still bullshit dude I agree
[04:06:32] <Trynity> http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/apr/19/new-york-primary-live-results-trump-clinton
[04:06:37] <Trynity> Have some kawaii niggas
[04:06:51] <David> Malroth: a 4% increase is not unsubstantial
[04:06:51] <David> and you're forgetting that Sanders wants to tax capgains as normal income
[04:06:57] *** Parts: michaelincali (Mibbit@sorcery-ud9lf2.res.rr.com) ()
[04:07:03] <David> that means 20% -> 37-43%, a *huge* increase
[04:07:09] <David> and he wants a 2% increase in payroll taxes across the board
[04:07:18] <David> and he wants to remove free trade, which is going to increase prices
[04:07:23] <Malroth> I registered as a republican so I just voted for anybody but trump
[04:07:28] <David> etc, etc.
[04:07:39] <Trynity> Write in Sleepy Black Man, Malroth 
[04:07:43] <David> Sanders's tax platform is drastic and obscene
[04:07:48] <Connor> sweden is too good looking to pass up
[04:07:50] <Malroth> Do you think it will go through though?
[04:07:54] <Trynity> Your dick is drastic and obscene
[04:07:55] <Malroth> Every president makes those promises
[04:07:57] <Connor> agreed, fuck you david
[04:08:21] <Connor> sanders isn't like other candidates Malroth, he doesn't just say things because people wanna hear it
[04:08:30] <Connor> 10 years ago clinton said that gay marriage is sinful
[04:08:34] <Trynity> But yea tbh I'm voting with the expectation and even hope that some of Sanders more ridiculous things don't go through
[04:08:56] <Demisedulous> Theoretically
[04:09:09] <Demisedulous> What would happen if all of the states
[04:09:10] <Demisedulous> didn
[04:09:11] <Demisedulous> t vote
[04:09:14] <David> Malroth: no, but it'll be a worrying trend if Sanders gets into office and a democratic majority enters the senate and house in 2018/2020
[04:09:23] <Malroth> oh I get you David
[04:09:26] <Trynity> Congress chooses, Demisedulous 
[04:09:28] <Malroth> honestly though.. hillary will win, right?
[04:09:29] <David> Trump is equally worrying
[04:09:32] <Trynity> I think the Senate specifically
[04:09:37] <Trynity> Probably Malroth 
[04:09:38] <Demisedulous> Ah, that isn't that great then
[04:09:45] <David> Put it this way - I distrust populists generally speaking... oversimplified 'solutions' generally do not work
[04:09:54] <Connor> it's a good chance Malroth 
[04:09:57] <Trynity> tbh I wanna see it go to the convention
[04:09:58] <Connor> sanders and bernie are neck and neck
[04:10:07] <Trynity> Connor bb
[04:10:11] <David> yep
[04:10:13] <David> in fact
[04:10:14] <Trynity> Think about what you just said
[04:10:15] <David> their poll numbers
[04:10:17] <David> are exactly identical
[04:10:21] <David> in every single poll
[04:10:29] <Connor> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1bnfez8Ti0
[04:10:29] <Trynity> It's pretty amazing tbh
[04:10:40] <Malroth> David: if sanders' fuck the economy stuff did not go through would you approve?
[04:10:40] <Trynity> That for every Bernie voter that there's a Sanders voter
[04:10:45] <Trynity> Absolutely brutal race
[04:10:58] <David> If you removed Sanders's economic stances, I'd like him
[04:11:05] <Connor> well if sweden has the same economic stances
[04:11:08] <Connor> then what's wrong with it?
[04:11:15] <Malroth> that is my position too
[04:11:22] <Malroth> if his economic stuff was gone sure, if not then nope
[04:11:31] <David> A lot of things are wrong with sweden.
[04:11:46] <David> For one, their social programs are unsustainable and they're cutting back
[04:11:47] <Malroth> trump is good on taxes right?
[04:11:48] <Connor> yeah but american companies shit on the environment
[04:12:01] <David> Also, taxes are obscene, and good luck if you're trying to get rich
[04:12:07] <David> (although that could be a cultural thing as well)
[04:12:10] <Connor> literally like, the standard is the soil can't be above 80 ppm nitrates or some shit
[04:12:15] <David> it's not a culture that is friendly to the ambitious
[04:12:24] <Trynity> David would you have sexual relations with a candidate that had Sander's social ideas but Johnson's economic ideas?
[04:12:30] <Malroth> trump is 25% taxes 150k+ for single people
[04:12:35] <David> and the government is similarly unfriendly to ambitious people
[04:12:42] <Malroth> is he changing other stuff or is that outright better than the current?
[04:13:00] <Trynity> The poor aren't taxed at all under his plan, Malroth 
[04:13:06] <Trynity> I think up to even 50k?
[04:13:10] <David> Malroth: it's definitely doable (singapore's top tax rate is 18%), but you'd have to cut a lot of pork and inefficiencies, which is politically infeasable
[04:13:12] <Malroth> 25k single 50k married iirc
[04:13:15] <David> and Trump's stance on free trade is just nuts
[04:13:29] <David> Trynity: Johnson's social ideas are similar to Sanders's....
[04:13:33] <Malroth> his tax stance is better than bernie's, all I know
[04:13:57] <Trynity> That's not the question
[04:14:08] <Trynity> Would you have sexual relations with a candidate as described?
[04:14:28] <David> Depends on a lot of things, Trynity 
[04:14:38] <Trynity> He's a cute twink
[04:14:49] <David> I wouldn't have sex with a male
[04:14:57] <David> end of story
[04:14:58] <Trynity> I didn't say he was a male I said he was a twink
[04:15:13] <David> *he*
[04:15:13] <David> case closed
[04:15:14] <Malroth> how much money would you have sex with donald trump for, assuming the whole world would know
[04:15:19] <Malroth> there has to be a number
[04:15:21] <Trynity> David
[04:15:28] <Trynity> Do I need to lecture you in identity
[04:15:38] <Connor> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd5w2T5Q2O4
[04:15:46] <David> Malroth: >10million
[04:15:53] <Malroth> i'm 2.5mil+
[04:16:02] <Trynity> 5m here
[04:16:07] <David> 2.5M is nice but would not drastically change my life
[04:16:10] <Malroth> keep in mind we aren't that rich on LI, 600sqft house only costs 1.2k/mo to rent
[04:16:14] <Trynity> Yea, David already has that much
[04:16:22] <David> the publicity would be brutal though
[04:16:29] <David> Trynity: lol
[04:16:44] <Malroth> in berkeley what'd that be 2k+?
[04:16:54] <David> not yet
[04:16:57] <Trynity> A proper house? Easily 5k+
[04:17:13] <David> 600sqft? yeah, 2-3k/month
[04:17:21] <Malroth> yeah 600sqft
[04:17:25] <Trynity> Nigga he said house not apartment
[04:17:27] <David> 600sqft is tiny
[04:17:33] <Malroth> don't get me wrong though: 1.2k for 600sqft is still expensive as shit right?
[04:17:34] <Trynity> I think renting an entire house is gonna be more
[04:17:38] <David> I don't know if you could find a 600sqft house at all
[04:17:39] <Trynity> Even if that house is for ants
[04:17:40] <Malroth> it is 1.2k for 600sqft here
[04:17:47] <Trynity> >what are tiny houses
[04:17:50] <Trynity> David bb pls
[04:17:53] <Trynity> You live in San Fran
[04:17:58] <David> Malroth: I'm paying a fair amount more for that much space
[04:17:59] <Trynity> You should know
[04:18:04] <David> also, ~800sqft in palo alto is ~1.1M
[04:18:20] <Trynity> Damn, 1.1m/month to rent that?
[04:18:22] <Malroth> in other parts of the nation you could get like 1.5k sqft for 700/mo or something silly
[04:18:30] <Malroth> 1.2k for 600 is still hilariously expensive :P
[04:18:58] <David> well, depends on location
[04:19:35] <Malroth> i'm saying compared to the US overall I feel it's still expensive
[04:19:43] <Malroth> not as expensive as cali, but NY is still ridiculous
[04:19:48] <David> US overall is dirt cheap
[04:19:49] <Malroth> unless it's the city/hamptons where it is just dumb
[04:19:57] <David> hell, you can get a 7.5 acre estate and a 7000sqft house for just 1.8M in atlanta
[04:20:10] <David> in SF you'd be lucky to get 1500sqft and a tiny yard for that much
[04:20:23] <Malroth> we paid 600k for 1.75 acres
[04:20:26] <David> (well, the decent part of SF where you won't get shot)
[04:20:43] <Malroth> idk how that factors into SF. but still expensive compared to the US.
[04:20:45] <Malroth> and that's what matters!
[04:20:48] <David> er, not atlanta. kentucky or somewhere around that
[04:21:27] <Malroth> dude in alabama you can buy 43 acres for 164k
[04:21:34] <David> In any case, I don't look down. I look up to my goals :)
[04:21:37] <Lajjla> David, why is your name not Dave The All-Powerful Warrior Who—Due To His Endurance and Inflexible Will to Win—Goeth From Victory to Victory, Leaving Fire In His Wake?
[04:21:56] <Malroth> the thing I feel about cali.. the homes themselves look nicer imo
[04:21:59] <Malroth> like, the inside
[04:22:08] <David> eh heh heh heh
[04:22:09] <David> if only
[04:22:25] <Malroth> lol alabama is a joke
[04:22:27] <Malroth> 1546 sqfrt
[04:22:29] <Malroth> 950/mo
[04:22:30] <Malroth> what
[04:22:40] <Malroth> how is everybody in alabama not a millionaire
[04:23:03] <Malroth> 1sqft is cheaper than $1, literally everywhere what the fuck is this
[04:23:14] <David> salaries are probably shit there too
[04:23:42] <David> some articles on people's crappy financial behavior https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4fi6zy/an_informative_and_interesting_article_written_by/
[04:23:49] <David> tl;dr people are shit at saving and controlling their expenses
[04:24:31] <Malroth> Do you agree that it's better to grow up in an expensive area to teach you money responsibility?
[04:24:48] <David> dunno
[04:24:49] <Malroth> If you grow up and get a job and have to pay 1.2k/mo for a 600sqft house.. you probavbly learn to manage money better
[04:25:03] <David> It's about how you manage your money, not what your expenses are
[04:25:04] <Malroth> then when you go to AL, idc if the salaries are cheaper, you'd literally pay 4-500 for that same house
[04:25:07] <Trynity> This just in: Sanders won Clinton county :^)
[04:25:14] <Malroth> I feel that high expenses forces you to manage it better
[04:25:27] <David> if you multiply everything by an O(1) constant nothing changes
[04:26:18] <David> money is just math
[04:26:45] <David> stuff goes in, stuff goes out, there are investment vehicles that multiply your investment by a random variable
[04:26:51] <Malroth> I highly doubt that a 120k salary in Ny would be 50k in AL
[04:26:57] <Malroth> lower, but doubtful 50k
[04:29:40] <Malroth> anyway Connor.. you wanna play realm a bit? for the old times?
[04:29:45] <Connor> ehhh
[04:29:48] <Connor> sure

[04:30:21] <Connor> me and you work then
[04:30:31] <Malroth> hm?
[04:30:34] <Connor> cuz I suck
[04:30:37] <Connor> and also have had 8/8s
[04:30:41] <Malroth> when entering a new server there is now a 120sec tp delay
[04:30:43] <Connor> I've died to the puppets like 3 times
[04:30:46] <Connor> oh yeah
[04:30:48] <Connor> they did that
[04:30:50] <Malroth> well, that's the thing: you suck among good players
[04:30:52] <Connor> it's basically stopped TPers
[04:30:57] <Malroth> you are still a good player otherwise you could not get 8/8s easily
[04:31:09] <Connor> yeah, I just don't do the amazing feats
[04:31:11] <Connor> other players do
[04:31:17] <Connor> like rushing tombs, trenches, and shattesr
[04:31:29] <Malroth> what server? and I rush tomb/trench but not shats
[04:31:59] <Connor> lemme open up my rotmgehuh

[04:58:05] <Connor> tryn
[04:58:28] <Connor> feels good to be the ugliest, but the bestest Malroth 
[04:59:57] <Malroth> heh, indeed 
[05:00:11] <Malroth> They can have juggs and crowns all the want but most are 6/8, 6/8 with jugg you're a dick
[05:01:54] <Connor> i like how we make those kinda assumptions
[05:02:18] <Malroth> Look, if you use jugg as a 6/8 you are stupid
[05:02:32] <Malroth> Like it's not a debate, you are dumb if you use that with unmaxed life
[05:03:48] <Connor> agreed
[05:04:37] <Malroth> Crown is even worse
[05:04:49] <Malroth> jugg/ubhp is one thing but ggen/crown 6/8 is a whole new realm of assholery
[05:04:55] <Malroth> fuck, i'd be nervous to use crown 8/8
[05:07:47] <Connor> most people don't wear their crowns
[05:08:22] <Malroth> Many warrs do from my experience.
[05:25:25] <Demisedulous> I prefer pyra on jugg warrior
[05:25:33] <Demisedulous> for +8 def
[05:25:51] <Demisedulous> My crown is better utilized on archer anyway
[05:26:11] <Malroth> Idk, when you have a jugg don't you reach 100+ with crown?
[05:27:33] <Demisedulous> I mean the +4 def on pyra is boosted to +8 by jugg, so it gives more stats for your ring slot than crown does
[05:27:53] <Demisedulous> THinking of putting my bracer on my warr, but the mp would be wasted
[05:27:58] <Demisedulous> but 12 def sounds very nice
[05:28:21] <Malroth> well you're trading 8 def for 6 dex if you have jugg up nonstop
[05:28:38] <Malroth> don't bracer warr. pyra better
[05:28:49] <Demisedulous> yeah that's what I'm feeling
[05:29:03] <Demisedulous> dex on warr is kinda eh, anyway
[05:29:15] <Demisedulous> he already shoots like a black man
[05:29:46] <Demisedulous> If I liked knight more I'd probably put bracer on it
[05:29:49] <Demisedulous> but I hate the class
[05:29:54] <Demisedulous> so no go
[05:30:33] <Malroth> Er.. bracer wiz?
[05:30:40] <Demisedulous> I used to run that
[05:30:43] <Demisedulous> then I switched to pyra
[05:30:58] <Demisedulous> I like more hp on squishies to protect from burst
[05:31:07] <Malroth> I guess
[05:31:10] <Demisedulous> 2 def does dick all in a tomb
[05:31:14] <Demisedulous> and wiz is a tomb class for me
[05:31:24] <Demisedulous> Would rather the 100 hp
[05:32:12] <Malroth> Maybe sin, rogue, or even sorc
[05:33:01] <Demisedulous> Rogue already perma cloaks, so the mp is eh
[05:33:20] <Demisedulous> I equip an exa mp then switch to expo after the initial burst on sin
[05:33:40] <Demisedulous> and sorc would be a prime choice for bracer, but expo will always be cheaper 
[05:33:49] <Malroth> But you have a bracer, don't you?
[05:33:54] <Malroth> Why not use it then, lol
[05:34:08] <Demisedulous> I only use it on classes over a certain base fame
[05:34:28] <Malroth> I do stuff based on max, not fame
[05:34:38] <Malroth> Event/shatters ut are 7/8 missing mana on
[05:34:38] <Demisedulous> low base fame means I haven't played them enough or I died recently on them, so I don't trust myself with good gear on them
[05:35:09] <Demisedulous> maxed life is a given
[05:35:32] <Malroth> I died on 0/8 with oreo once. Never ever doing that again fuck.
[05:35:38] <Demisedulous> pFFT
[05:35:48] <Demisedulous> The six million didn't die for that
[05:36:05] <Demisedulous> I actually dislike oreo a lot
[05:36:24] <Demisedulous> Maybe I should try it now, last time I used it my pet was a lot weaker
[05:36:30] <Malroth> just look at all this fuckery http://www.realmeye.com/graveyard-of-player/Malroth/301
[05:36:32] <Malroth> bottom half

[05:40:22] *** Quits: VerifiedShitlady (pomegranate@sorcery-558.ohg.56.172.IP) (Quit: I meant it when I said I wanna get well!)
[05:40:23] <Demisedulous> as per the warrior mindset
[05:40:25] <Malroth> lv6 masa ninja dies to Green Den Spider Hatchling
[05:40:40] <Malroth> except i bought masas as leveling anyway lol
[05:41:31] <Malroth> and my favorite Demisedulous? http://i.imgur.com/iwGwHC2.png
[05:41:48] <Malroth> compare to http://www.realmeye.com/graveyard-of-player/kalandra graveyard
[05:42:41] <Demisedulous> Fuckin rights
[05:42:52] <Malroth> would you agree the 2nd is, uh, better?
[05:43:39] <Demisedulous> Ofc
[05:43:44] <Demisedulous> but I mean, if this is you still
[05:43:48] <Demisedulous> you've got experience now
[05:43:55] <Demisedulous> so ofc it'll have less deaths
[05:44:10] <Malroth> yeah
[05:44:23] <Demisedulous> my biggest regret is not buying a qot on UT weekend
[05:44:28] <Malroth> i'm legit proud of my 9th death being a 4/8 warr and my 10th being 8/8 though, if you consider the first few were char unlocks even
[05:44:32] <Demisedulous> I bought a jugg for 8 defense
[05:44:34] <Demisedulous> but no damn qot
[05:44:35] <Malroth> what
[05:44:37] <Malroth> fuck you
[05:44:42] <Demisedulous> ikr
[05:44:47] <Demisedulous> It was like
[05:44:50] <Malroth> they were like 8life right?
[05:44:51] <Demisedulous> 2 am monday
[05:44:58] <Demisedulous> and the kid was worried he'd never sell
[05:45:01] <Demisedulous> and I had been abyss farming
[05:45:07] <Malroth> lol why would you sell a jugg anyway?
[05:45:07] <Demisedulous> and just so happened to have 8 def
[05:45:12] <Malroth> what benefit is there to selling a jugg
[05:45:13] <Demisedulous> I traded him
[05:45:16] <Demisedulous> selected all 8 def
[05:45:18] <Demisedulous> and said
[05:45:20] <Demisedulous> do it or I walk
[05:45:22] <Malroth> like why would you ever sell that? maybe eventually you'll wanna play warr
[05:45:24] <Demisedulous> and he did it, the mad man
[05:45:26] <Malroth> and then maybe you'll HAVE A FUCKING JUGG
[05:45:31] <Malroth> what's your acc?
[05:45:46] <Demisedulous> https://www.realmeye.com/player/DemiPony
[05:46:03] <Demisedulous> you don't even want to see my muledump, it's disgusting
[05:46:23] <Demisedulous> I've taken to dropping every single pot I get, since I have so many stored
[05:46:24] <Malroth> can I? I kinda wanna see the muledump of a 14 8/8 player
[05:46:26] <Demisedulous> people love it
[05:46:37] <Malroth> meh 8 8/8
[05:47:12] <Malroth> man, looking at your graveyard.. are you cheap lmao? sky 8/8 knight
[05:47:21] <Demisedulous> I am indeed cheap
[05:47:29] <Demisedulous> I only outfit classes I like with good stuff
[05:47:35] <Demisedulous> man, I've died like
[05:47:40] <Demisedulous> 8 times the past two years
[05:47:45] <Demisedulous> on major characters
[05:47:48] <Demisedulous> and every single one of them
[05:47:51] <Demisedulous> has a bullshit store
[05:47:52] <Demisedulous> y
[05:47:58] <Malroth> dude, that reminds me
[05:48:05] <Malroth> so I drink the final life to get 8/8 and do a shats right after
[05:48:15] <Malroth> you know on the bottom right corner how the woods on first area can block vision?
[05:48:20] <Demisedulous> oh yeah
[05:48:27] <Malroth> well, see i'm walking it
[05:48:35] <Malroth> and as i'm half a tile away.. I see small blue projectiles
[05:48:47] <Demisedulous> and bam, one of those tiny white balls that explode into 350 dmg spheres of death
[05:49:02] <Malroth> thankfully only hit the side
[05:49:10] <Malroth> but holy fuck dude that scared me. 500dmg in 1/4 a sec
[05:49:18] <Demisedulous> http://i.imgur.com/tzlc7BT.png
[05:49:21] <Demisedulous> Here's my md
[05:49:42] <Malroth> my biggest regret has been not keeping a gold medal/america ring'
[05:49:48] <Demisedulous> I stopped caring about muling when they did that mass banning of spambots and I lost 30 life and 12 mules
[05:50:00] <Demisedulous> so this has been sitting untouched for a good 1.5-2 years now
[05:50:21] <Demisedulous> every single UT is on my main
[05:50:29] <Malroth> remember when the lod robes were t14 and dupable?
[05:50:31] <Demisedulous> cuz of that one weekend we had
[05:50:48] <Malroth> well I admit, I duped like 16 robes lmao, was literally selling them at 3-4jugg a piece
[05:50:54] <Malroth> all of those juggs? on a mule. banned mule.
[05:50:55] <Demisedulous> I remember when they were tiered and dropping with loot pots
[05:51:04] <Demisedulous> didn't know they were dupeable 
[05:51:07] <Demisedulous> lol, karma
[05:51:07] <Malroth> so on some banned mule, I have 16 juggs
[05:51:32] <Malroth> have you tried emailing them and asking nicely? they unbanned 2 life mules out of "good will" the last time I tried
[05:51:35] <Malroth> oh and http://i.imgur.com/0hJW99m.png is mine lol
[05:51:47] <Demisedulous> I emailed support
[05:51:49] <Demisedulous> wrote on the forums
[05:51:51] <Demisedulous> posted on reddit
[05:51:55] <Demisedulous> started an outcry
[05:51:57] <Demisedulous> and nothin happened
[05:52:10] <Malroth> you're supposed to email support and ask really nicely make it like you didn't know
[05:52:34] <Demisedulous> I never got the hype with unb hp's
[05:52:36] <Malroth> while you're at it, email them every time a char dies. if they're feeling nice they'll give you 500 fame. not joking.
[05:52:43] <Demisedulous> literally had 0 interest in acquiring them
[05:52:46] <Malroth> one ubhp is on my warr bc I have still not dropped pyra or crown
[05:52:48] <Demisedulous> they're a shitty ring imo
[05:52:50] <Malroth> other ubhp was dropped by me
[05:52:57] <Malroth> it is the best non ut warr ring
[05:53:09] <Demisedulous> Only reason they're so in favour is cuz they're a higher currency than life
[05:53:18] <Demisedulous> but even then it got duped to shit, so shouldn't even be worth anything
[05:53:32] <Demisedulous> I wish pots would stack to 4
[05:53:47] <Demisedulous> not only would it open up safer trading
[05:54:00] <Demisedulous> but it'd let me play this damn game without needing to organise 100 mules
[05:54:04] <Malroth> ubhp is a shit market: buy for 5 sell for 4
[05:54:06] <Malroth> every single time
[05:54:44] <Demisedulous> Sometimes I'll ask myself what I'll do with 18 gsorcs
[05:54:47] <Demisedulous> I never have an answer
[05:55:25] <Demisedulous> wonder if my valentines are worth anything as well
[05:55:27] <Demisedulous> probably not
[05:55:32] <Demisedulous> people were making thousands of them
[05:55:43] <Malroth> you know how some people have stories of some guy selecting an item, accepting, and you not getting it?
[05:55:49] <Malroth> that shit actually happened to me. was amazed.
[05:55:58] <Demisedulous> It's fuckin weird
[05:56:07] <Demisedulous> I think it's lag related
[05:56:08] <Demisedulous> like
[05:56:13] <Demisedulous> they're laggy and you're not
[05:56:18] <Malroth> there was an old trick that worked to scam the tradebots
[05:56:23] <Malroth> you'd trade, switch an item
[05:56:33] <Malroth> and they'd sell you gsorc for 1dex that you swapped with life
[05:56:35] <Malroth> fixed now
[05:56:41] <Demisedulous> pffft
[05:56:51] <Malroth> btw it bothers me you have 18hydra, 18gsorc, 8 acrop
[05:57:03] <Demisedulous> they're rarer for some reason
[05:57:18] <Demisedulous> I got 2 cbows in one trench before, connor
[05:57:23] <Demisedulous> Connor
[05:57:25] <Demisedulous> Cbows
[05:57:39] <Demisedulous> 15 cbows, connor
[05:57:41] <Demisedulous> ehehehehheheheheheheheehe
[05:58:12] <Malroth> 8 dbows
[05:58:22] <Demisedulous> There was a time when I had 0
[05:58:24] <Malroth> UndeadLairsCompleted    79
[05:58:27] <Malroth> give me my fucking dbow
[05:58:29] <Demisedulous> and I had ran hundreds of them
[05:58:37] <Demisedulous> I borrowed one from a friend
[05:58:39] <Demisedulous> ran a udl with it
[05:58:40] <Demisedulous> and got my own
[05:58:42] <Demisedulous> it was sick
[05:58:58] <Demisedulous> now they just drop like candy
[05:59:01] <Demisedulous> faster than I can use em
[05:59:02] <Malroth> this was with the 1/1k droprates?
[05:59:11] <Demisedulous> yep
[05:59:28] <Malroth> you remember when rmt was allowed on official forums?
[05:59:59] <Demisedulous> I don't remember it being allowed, but I definitely remember it being a thing
[06:00:07] <Malroth> well I see a guy in nex posting an email and a password. so I login. and.. it's this rich fucker's account
[06:00:15] <Malroth> guy has 8 edetos on a charslot
[06:00:17] <Malroth> lots of uts
[06:00:34] <Malroth> and, call me stupid, call me whatever, but.. I PM THE GUY AND TELL HIM SOME DUDE POSTED HIS ACC
[06:00:38] <Malroth> I don't take ANYTHING. nothing.
[06:01:01] <Malroth> I could've taken thousands of def from that guy. 8 edetos at 150def a piece!
[06:01:33] <Demisedulous> lol, good goy
[06:01:39] <Demisedulous> You made america proud that day
[06:01:46] <Malroth> the guy fucking thanks me and that's it.
[06:01:51] <Malroth> pay me? nah
[06:01:57] <Demisedulous> I only ever used an ammy once
[06:02:16] <Demisedulous> I put it on a 3/8 knight and immediately die and revive to a davy jones
[06:02:21] <Malroth> I used ammies 15 times or so.
[06:02:22] <Demisedulous> never got another before they went zombie mode
[06:02:27] <Malroth> Had one on 6/8 wiz, doing a tomb
[06:02:27] <Demisedulous> never liked them
[06:02:31] <Demisedulous> I was all about para hp's
[06:02:33] <Malroth> walk onto red swarm
[06:02:34] <Malroth> boom
[06:02:37] <Malroth> first room
[06:02:48] <Demisedulous> lol
[06:02:58] <Demisedulous> I remember staying up til 6 in the morning one day playing non stop
[06:02:59] <Malroth> had 8 ammies, postdupe, when they were 2-3 tops a piece
[06:03:06] <Malroth> didn't sell any
[06:03:07] <Demisedulous> I had maxed a sorcerer to 6/8 that night alone
[06:03:10] <Malroth> hahahahahahaha i'm so smart
[06:03:13] <Demisedulous> then I went into a realm tomb
[06:03:16] <Demisedulous> all by myself
[06:03:23] <Demisedulous> walked into the first room
[06:03:32] <Demisedulous> and got instagibbed by jackals
[06:03:35] <Demisedulous> or traps
[06:03:38] <Demisedulous> just some insane thing
[06:03:47] <Malroth> trap scarabs is best.
[06:03:51] <Malroth> or nut rage on robe
[06:03:51] <Demisedulous> Nowadays I rush tombs on wizard
[06:03:57] <Demisedulous> oh yeah
[06:04:01] <Malroth> you.. rush tombs on wiz?
[06:04:06] <Demisedulous> nothing feels better than dps'ing nut on wizard
[06:04:13] <Malroth> ever drop a geb ring from the priests?
[06:04:17] <Demisedulous> on whatever class I have, really
[06:04:18] <Malroth> curious how rare they are
[06:04:22] <Demisedulous> Never
[06:04:40] <Malroth> guess i'll buy that shit for a life
[06:04:43] <Malroth> meh
[06:04:54] <Demisedulous> Only good if you want to complete the set
[06:04:58] <Demisedulous> pretty shit by itself
[06:05:08] <Demisedulous> I bought the paladin set ring for a life
[06:05:12] <Malroth> it is "ok" on pally/priest
[06:05:23] <Demisedulous> immediately regret it when I learned the pally set seal was so shitty
[06:05:35] <Demisedulous> and immediately tried to sell it back
[06:05:38] <Demisedulous> never could
[06:05:43] <Malroth> lol pally seal
[06:05:54] <Malroth> pally ring is the ring i buy when i'm killing a famefarm character
[06:05:59] <Demisedulous> like come on, the set seal for pally is garbage
[06:06:17] <Malroth> the seal is offset by the sword/armor
[06:06:19] <Malroth> which is godlike
[06:06:22] <Demisedulous> I get triggered when I see pallies using it
[06:06:55] <David> lole http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/nyregion/donald-trumps-jet-a-regular-on-the-campaign-trail-is-not-registered-to-fly.html
[06:07:27] <Lajjla> so there's going to be a Dr.Strange film.
[06:07:32] <Lajjla> With Cumberbatch in fact
[06:08:14] <Malroth> you ever farm qot demi?
[06:08:22] <Demisedulous> All my life
[06:08:26] <Demisedulous> every ent in the realm
[06:08:27] <Demisedulous> every time
[06:08:29] <Demisedulous> buffed to shit
[06:08:30] <Demisedulous> no qot
[06:08:33] <Demisedulous> in 4 damn years
[06:08:54] <Demisedulous> All my guildies always give up on it
[06:09:00] <Connor> you know I was playing CS:GO Demisedulous 
[06:09:02] <Connor> couldn't respond to you
[06:09:05] <Demisedulous> then it's just me fighting 2-3 nature sprites
[06:09:13] <Demisedulous> I hate it
[06:09:16] <Demisedulous> I want qot so much
[06:09:21] <Demisedulous> it's like a long range stun
[06:09:27] <Malroth> i wish warr could solo buff to 6 sprites
[06:09:28] <Malroth> but you can't
[06:09:35] <Malroth> you do like 32.5k
[06:09:38] <Malroth> but it's never enough
[06:09:48] <Demisedulous> It's saddening
[06:10:17] <Malroth> maybe with ubdex. maybe
[06:10:38] <Demisedulous> I carry an exadex on my huntress that I use in glands
[06:10:48] <Demisedulous> Iunno why, I just do
[06:10:57] <Malroth> ewww
[06:10:58] <Demisedulous> prolly too used to crown + quiver dex o narcher
[06:11:00] <Malroth> you're supposed to do exaatk
[06:11:08] <Demisedulous> to ever be happy with huntress dex
[06:11:14] <Malroth> am I the only one who wants qot for the dbow qot spectral ubatk set?
[06:11:25] <David> I fucking love qot
[06:11:25] <Demisedulous> Overrated
[06:11:29] <Demisedulous> but I'd definitely try it
[06:11:41] <Malroth> you can oneshot gods w/o the whole set but.. fuck, I want it
[06:11:48] <Demisedulous> my huntress also uses covert
[06:11:53] <Demisedulous> so exa dex feels really good
[06:11:54] <David> I almost fulltimed it on my archer
[06:12:15] <Malroth> average hit 1051
[06:12:33] <Malroth> tbh the only reason I want t14 weps to be released
[06:12:38] <Malroth> is because t14 bow uses dbow arrow
[06:12:56] <Demisedulous> black bow
[06:12:57] <Demisedulous> yesss
[06:13:09] <Demisedulous> Before that though
[06:13:14] <Demisedulous> tiered bows need to armour pierce
[06:13:22] <Demisedulous> that'd fix all problems with them
[06:13:26] <Demisedulous> also a tighter spread
[06:13:35] <Malroth> trust me, if tiered bows pierced nobody would ever use dbow imo
[06:13:51] <Demisedulous> Dbow would still be better for tombs and trenches
[06:13:58] <Demisedulous> anything that needs sb whoring in 1-2 hits
[06:14:02] <David> wait, what?
[06:14:02] <David> oh, armor pierce
[06:14:05] <Malroth> trenches no, tomb yea
[06:14:05] <David> or penetrating, as starbreak calls it
[06:14:18] <Demisedulous> It'd be so nice
[06:14:22] <Demisedulous> tiered bows deal like
[06:14:24] <Demisedulous> negative dmg
[06:14:28] <Demisedulous> on half the things in the game
[06:14:34] <David> prot priest + cwand man
[06:14:43] <David> unkillable and not that bad on bosses
[06:14:56] <Demisedulous> I like old cwand
[06:15:03] <Demisedulous> but new one is eh, too
[06:15:08] <David> I've never played the new cwand actually
[06:15:18] <Demisedulous> No piercing really makes it shit
[06:15:23] <Demisedulous> you can't hit anything
[06:15:35] <Demisedulous> only good for tombs
[06:15:45] <Demisedulous> or castle guardians
[06:16:07] <Demisedulous> I've never seen that natural shaitans thing
[06:16:13] <Demisedulous> the oryx minidungeons or whatever
[06:16:28] <Malroth> oh yeah 
[06:16:30] <Malroth> that's funny
[06:16:31] <Demisedulous> Maybe I should check it out next chance U get
[06:16:39] <Malroth> janus has a loot chest you know?
[06:16:47] <David> is ogmur still rare as fuck?
[06:16:49] <Malroth> and after you kill janus you go through the portal to court of oryx
[06:16:49] <Demisedulous> He have a UT?
[06:16:53] <Malroth> yes david no demi
[06:16:55] <Malroth> anyway
[06:17:02] <Malroth> i soloed janus and killed the chest
[06:17:03] <Demisedulous> no wonder nobody does it
[06:17:06] <Malroth> by the time the chest died?
[06:17:10] <David> ogmur is for baller knights
[06:17:10] <David> stuns are overrated
[06:17:11] <Malroth> the fucking portal vanished
[06:17:19] <Demisedulous> fuckin RIGHTS
[06:17:30] <Demisedulous> David: Why not both?
[06:17:44] <Malroth> ogmur pixie ftw
[06:17:49] <Demisedulous> What'd you even get from janus
[06:17:53] <Demisedulous> a dex pot and a vit
[06:18:06] <Demisedulous> maybe an astral
[06:18:40] <Malroth> vit
[06:18:51] <Demisedulous> k e k
[06:18:52] <Connor> kyle
[06:18:53] <Demisedulous> e
[06:18:54] <Demisedulous> j
[06:18:54] <Connor> what's the slang for vagina
[06:18:56] <Connor> it goes like
[06:18:58] <Malroth> cooch
[06:19:00] <Demisedulous> twat
[06:19:00] <Connor> it has the word "hoo" in it
[06:19:01] <Demisedulous> cunt
[06:19:04] <Demisedulous> hooter
[06:19:06] <Malroth> i wanna do shaitans more because of the skull
[06:19:06] <Demisedulous> no
[06:19:08] <Demisedulous> pooter
[06:19:09] <Connor> oh no
[06:19:11] <Connor> hooha
[06:19:12] <Connor> that's the one
[06:19:13] <Demisedulous> cooter
[06:19:16] <Demisedulous> hooha
[06:19:20] <Malroth> wanna get together and do some one day with Connor?
[06:19:29] <Connor> i dunno how I feel about having a threesome with you Malroth 
[06:19:35] <Connor> send picturse and we'll discuss the positions
[06:19:39] <Demisedulous> Shaitans makes me so stressed out
[06:19:43] <Malroth> nah foursome
[06:19:51] <Malroth> i tried soloing shaitan but it's shitty man
[06:19:53] <Demisedulous> just cuz it feels like you could insta die at any moment
[06:19:59] <Malroth> you don't have enough time to hit him
[06:20:00] <Connor> rotmg honestly
[06:20:02] <Connor> stresses me out so bad
[06:20:04] <Malroth> the mini hands are ridiculous
[06:20:06] <Connor> even things as simple as O2 or O1
[06:20:08] <Connor> make me fucking nervous
[06:20:09] <Malroth> pixie warr?
[06:20:11] <Malroth> not enough
[06:20:16] <Malroth> insane
[06:20:19] <Demisedulous> yeah
[06:20:28] <Demisedulous> I only shaitans when it's a large group
[06:20:31] <Demisedulous> not worth it otherwise
[06:20:32] <Malroth> i personally think ray/ut skull are the two best looking rotmg items
[06:20:37] <Malroth> by far
[06:20:45] <Connor> i find the top tier staff
[06:20:47] <Connor> to look very pretty
[06:20:50] <Connor> as well as the old top one
[06:21:18] <Malroth> the problem is if I got the skull
[06:21:21] <Demisedulous> I want skull of endless torment to afflict enemies with a debuff that constantly drains their health and gives it to you as long as  you remain in range
[06:21:24] <Malroth> would you ever have the balls to play with it?
[06:21:34] <Malroth> knowing that you could die with the rarest ut in the game?
[06:21:37] <Connor> i got like
[06:21:37] <Connor> 5 
[06:21:40] <Malroth> bullshit
[06:21:42] <Connor> of those skulls from the ice dungeon
[06:21:44] <Malroth> oh
[06:21:46] <Connor> lol
[06:21:47] <Malroth> that shitty thing? yeah
[06:21:52] <Connor> was it good or bad
[06:21:52] <Demisedulous> Yeah, lol
[06:21:53] <Malroth> endless torment is 100x better looking
[06:21:54] <Connor> I forget about it
[06:21:59] <Demisedulous> connor has the shittiest skull in the game
[06:22:02] <Demisedulous> shittiest UT, really
[06:22:03] <Escovan> ugh
[06:22:03] <Demisedulous> Esben
[06:22:08] <Escovan> too much wine
[06:22:19] <Malroth> the OG set is cosmic/eternal torment/gsorc/crown
[06:22:21] <Escovan> good morning
[06:22:26] <Malroth> amazing looking
[06:22:46] <Connor> there's shittier UTs and you know it
[06:22:48] <Demisedulous> My priest has present wand, divine flavour, gsorc, and unb vit
[06:22:52] <Demisedulous> looks really good
[06:22:54] <Connor> we have all the shitty Uts
[06:22:56] <Malroth> present wand looks great
[06:23:04] <Malroth> shittiest uts to me are.. esben staff/skull
[06:23:07] <Demisedulous> White bag tier UT? Esben is the shittiest
[06:23:13] <Connor> I'm going to find one shittier
[06:23:14] <Malroth> nah
[06:23:15] <Malroth> ctrap
[06:23:21] <Connor> ctrap is good though
[06:23:23] <Demisedulous> HEY 
[06:23:26] <Demisedulous> don't you rip on ctrap
[06:23:30] <Malroth> OMG I GOT A CBO-trap
[06:23:42] <Demisedulous> why don't you say that to your huntress next time you fight the forgotten king
[06:23:42] <Connor> you can't judge it based on the fact that it's highly disappointing though
[06:23:50] <Connor> it's good for huntress
[06:23:54] <Demisedulous> "Oh yeah ctrap is shit, don't para him on tentacles please"
[06:24:02] <Connor> and huntress actually
[06:24:06] <Connor> has a lot of use, as demi tells me
[06:24:07] <Connor> every day
[06:24:11] <Malroth> i'll have you know if you para on tentacles it's a guaranteed life for you
[06:24:11] <Demisedulous> it does, dude
[06:24:17] <Malroth> since everybody nexuses but you
[06:24:25] <Malroth> you have to buff king though
[06:24:26] <Demisedulous> lol why
[06:24:28] <Malroth> like
[06:24:35] <Malroth> if you don't have 40 tortured souls onscreen at once
[06:24:38] <Malroth> are you even playing the shatters?
[06:24:44] <Demisedulous> fuck
[06:24:48] <Demisedulous> don't trigger me
[06:24:52] <Malroth> yeah i get dumbfucks who buff
[06:24:56] <Malroth> like why
[06:25:01] <Malroth> there is zero benefit
[06:25:24] <Malroth> i wish it increased crown droprate. i'd buff if so
[06:25:51] <Demisedulous> I'm glad to say the only time I ever died to shatters was when a pub one had mobs dragged to the spawn room as I went in to the portal late
[06:25:56] <Demisedulous> instantly died before I even loaded in
[06:25:58] <Malroth> you know i am tempted to spend like $100 on gold and spam shaitan keys
[06:26:01] <Malroth> i fucking want that skull
[06:26:16] <Demisedulous> don't forget to loot pot
[06:26:19] <Demisedulous> I'd go with you
[06:26:47] <Malroth> i'll see because like seriously, I WANT that thing lol
[06:26:57] <Connor> RIP demi's best character, died to extreme rustiness after a long time spent not playing
[06:27:00] <Malroth> I want it, I want flame cloth. and nobody ever does shaitans
[06:27:14] <Demisedulous> I've played a bit thesep ast few days, connor
[06:27:19] <Demisedulous> and I still felt like I had all my skill
[06:27:21] <Malroth> shaitans are 100gold now. you think 100 is enough to drop that fucker lol?
[06:27:25] <Connor> makes sense that you would
[06:27:28] <Connor> rotmg is ingrained in your skull
[06:27:35] <Malroth> well gold buy bonus
[06:27:45] <Malroth> so maybe more
[06:27:45] <Demisedulous> If I were you I would buy them one at a time
[06:27:54] <Demisedulous> so you don't get one immediately
[06:27:59] <Demisedulous> and then have to deal with 100 keys
[06:28:04] <Malroth> but imagine if I got two
[06:28:07] <Malroth> $100 is 160 keys
[06:28:20] <Demisedulous> the hell are you even going to store those
[06:28:21] <Malroth> like i could do a whole vault of skulls
[06:28:31] <Malroth> i would have a vault chest specifically for skulls
[06:28:50] <Malroth> like, 160 shaitans. that has to drop
[06:29:10] <Demisedulous> there's help lines for this kind of thing, mally
[06:29:24] <Connor> http://i.imgur.com/kBTFXE8.png
[06:29:30] <Malroth> wouldn't you pay $100 for like 5 skulls?
[06:29:36] <Connor> no, no he would not
[06:29:39] <Demisedulous> Nope
[06:29:56] <Connor> kyle probably wouldn't pay 100 bucks even if someone told him they were gonna chop off his pinkie finger otherwise
[06:30:02] <Malroth> how much would you pay for a crown or jugg
[06:30:08] <Demisedulous> Nothing
[06:30:13] <Demisedulous> I have both already
[06:30:27] <Malroth> anyway it's 12:30, I might need to get off soon
[06:30:32] <Malroth> I need to shower.. at 12:30 alone
[06:30:34] <Malroth> ugh

[06:30:45] <Demisedulous> my crowning
[06:30:46] <Demisedulous> achievement
[06:30:59] <Demisedulous> A kabamy even replied to the thread
[06:31:03] <Malroth> i got something even rarer than a crown
[06:31:14] <Malroth> guardian dropped me the following lootbag yesterday: ggen cosmic ubhp
[06:31:22] <Connor> http://imgur.com/a/dxT1B
[06:31:32] <Malroth> i was just like
[06:31:33] <Malroth> what
[06:31:35] <Malroth> is there a mistake
[06:31:39] <Demisedulous> Iunno
[06:31:44] <Demisedulous> tops aren't that rare
[06:31:45] <Demisedulous> like
[06:31:49] <Demisedulous> 1 in 20 it feels like
[06:32:02] <Malroth> yeah but two tops and ubhp?
[06:32:06] <Connor> that's impressive
[06:32:08] <Demisedulous> I think crown and bracer in the same dungeon
[06:32:11] <Demisedulous> is rarer than that
[06:32:21] <Malroth> it is, but my thing is rarer than crown alone imo
[06:32:23] <Malroth> by far
[06:32:39] <Demisedulous> I gotta go run some shitters and prove you wrong now
[06:32:44] <Malroth> imo it depends on ubhp droprate if we assume shats uts to be 1/100
[06:32:54] <Demisedulous> Connor, get the frank's all dressed up with nowhere to go chips
[06:33:06] <Demisedulous> shats UTs are not 1/100
[06:33:15] <Demisedulous> if they were there'd be thousands around
[06:33:18] <Connor> 1/100 is tooc ommon for a lot of things
[06:33:22] <Connor> like, most things
[06:33:23] <Demisedulous> with how many rolls at the loot there has been
[06:33:50] <Malroth> yeah. I guess you're right. I just know some guys who have rates similar to that
[06:33:55] <Malroth> what do you think, 1/300? 500?
[06:34:06] <Demisedulous> Standard 1/1000
[06:34:16] <Demisedulous> and some people are just lucky
[06:34:25] <Malroth> i don't think 1/1k. biit more common than that
[06:34:39] <Malroth> if it's 1k that's not some lucky, that's most lucky
[06:34:45] <Demisedulous> but is it really that common
[06:34:54] <Demisedulous> I go through pub shatters with 40+ people often
[06:34:57] <Demisedulous> and nobody gets any
[06:35:02] <Demisedulous> the vast majority of the time
[06:35:09] <Demisedulous> I was seeing like
[06:35:11] <Malroth> how many actually announce?
[06:35:25] <Malroth> you ever look at top warriors by class? like 1/20 have a shatters ring
[06:35:44] <Malroth> not the best sample size I mean..
[06:35:44] <Demisedulous> a lot of higher ups run shatters non stop
[06:35:54] <Demisedulous> I used to do like,
[06:35:59] <Demisedulous> 20-30 shatters a day 
[06:36:01] <Demisedulous> with MAFIA
[06:36:02] <Connor> kyle's been on the top before, the creme of the crop
[06:36:08] <Demisedulous> and I still never got more rings over my initial two
[06:36:10] <Malroth> I was in MAFIA.. for 5 minutes
[06:36:13] <Malroth> also was in NIN GUILD
[06:36:17] <Connor> i was in mafia for never

[06:40:50] <Demisedulous> I didn't get free pots, I got free tombs
[06:41:02] <Demisedulous> What was it called
[06:41:03] <Connor> it was like being a gangster in the streets being picked up in to the military
[06:41:11] <Demisedulous> I remember the owner was MentalKid or something
[06:41:31] <Demisedulous> and he'd often preach to me about why kabam doesn't care about hacks since hackers still pay them money
[06:41:38] <Connor> i came up with the greatest names http://puu.sh/ooVco/d7bcc4183b.png
[06:41:42] <Malroth> I guildhopped with NeutralMan and friend
[06:42:29] <Demisedulous> I remember going guildless for a bit

Some voters signed affidavit ballots after experiencing irregularities, ballots that will be counted if the voter in question can prove they meet eligibility requirements."
[19:14:03] <David> Not a big fan of philly
[19:14:10] <David> but it's cold in winter
[19:14:16] <Rajoguna> also i remember hearing a couple of weeks ago that NY reduced it's amount of voting places by 70%
[19:14:18] <VerifiedShitlady> DAVID THE UP OR ALASKA?
[19:14:27] <David> wtf is "the up"
[19:14:34] <VerifiedShitlady> The UP
[19:14:39] <VerifiedShitlady> the upper peninsula
[19:14:51] <David> cloud city?
[19:15:05] <David> dunno
[19:15:05] <Rajoguna> funny how Clinton keeps winning in states with massive amounts of controversy from voter suppression (Arizona) odd amount of coin flips (Iowa) or where there is crap like this now in NY!
[19:15:11] <VerifiedShitlady> you say the letters separately
[19:15:20] <David> why not canuckistan
[19:15:20] <David> move in with ankh
[19:15:20] <David> maybe he'll unban you
[19:15:21] <VerifiedShitlady> the you pee
[19:15:24] <Rajoguna> It's almost as if Hillary supporters have a tendency to try to cheat to help her win.
[19:15:33] <VerifiedShitlady> Lmao canuckistan
[19:15:37] <VerifiedShitlady> I say that too
[19:15:50] <David> from what I hear alaska sucks
[19:15:52] <David> expensive
[19:15:56] <David> not much there
[19:16:08] <VerifiedShitlady> The UP it is
[19:16:11] <David> and if you're up north (outside of anchorage) the days and nights can get really long
[19:16:13] <VerifiedShitlady> ima be a Yooper
[19:16:30] <Rajoguna> wtf wikipedia is still saying shes won Nevada when Sanders has as of the 2nd round in Nevada
[19:16:35] <VerifiedShitlady> The UP might as well be Canada
[19:17:07] <Rajoguna> Also I heard that Sanders is now beating her by 1 point nationally in terms of popularity.
[19:17:15] <Rajoguna> or popular vote or something like that
[19:17:23] <David> sanders is toast, mathematically speaking
[19:17:25] <VerifiedShitlady> Rajoguna: Alaska or the UP?
[19:17:26] <Rajoguna> probably popularity
[19:17:30] <David> unless he wins with a 60% margin in all remaining states
[19:17:34] <David> he's dead meat
[19:17:38] <VerifiedShitlady> David pls
[19:17:43] <Rajoguna> David what if he wins the popular vote or is more popular by the end
[19:17:48] <David> irrelevant
[19:17:57] <VerifiedShitlady> Let us live in our false hope a little while longer
[19:18:04] <Rajoguna> but if the partyy chooses her.. someone much less popular and less trusted
[19:18:11] <Rajoguna> one of the least trusted canidates in all of american history 
[19:18:16] <Rajoguna> ever since the polling started decades ago
[19:18:19] <David> Hillary beat Obama in '08 wrt popular vote
[19:18:21] <Rajoguna> how will that bode for them long term?
[19:18:36] <Rajoguna> but people trusted Obama more than Hillary even then
[19:19:01] <Rajoguna> The democratic party will implode if they choose hillary becuase she's alienated the democrats with her insane flip flopping and center right policy positins
[19:19:10] <VerifiedShitlady> If either candidate wins, it will be a first time minority win
[19:19:13] <Rajoguna> she does worse among independents than bernie does, this is a fact.
[19:19:14] <VerifiedShitlady> Sanders is jew
[19:19:22] <Rajoguna> that is backed up by massive amounts of polling data
[19:19:23] <VerifiedShitlady> Shillary is xx
[19:19:44] <VerifiedShitlady> Sanders is the only Jew who doesn't hoard money
[19:19:47] <Rajoguna> Even fox news can't deny that Sanders does better head on head against every GOP canidate
[19:19:53] <David> Rajoguna: the GOP is going to implode even worse
[19:20:03] <Rajoguna> Bill O'Riely was shocked in a recent cover he did of it
[19:20:11] <David> we may be seeing a political realignment
[19:20:11] <David> actually I ned to change my political party registration
[19:20:12] <Rajoguna> Ya David but by 4 years time they might regroup
[19:20:14] <David> I registered with the GOP to vote for rand paul
[19:20:18] <David> but now that he's out
[19:20:20] <David> I'm gonna register as a libertarian
[19:20:22] <Rajoguna> and the democratic party collapse will be further down the line
[19:20:49] <Rajoguna> David the issue is that the republians are collapsing now, if the democrats collapse later say in 4 or 8 years the republcians will have likely recovered.
[19:21:09] <David> As organizations, sure
[19:21:27] <Rajoguna> ok well in either case so long as the democrats get to choose a supreme court justice we might be okay. the main issue for me though is I don't think she will choose anyone who's proggressive enough or will overturn citizens united.
[19:21:27] <David> but political parties are generally fragile coalitions of different interest groups
[19:21:40] <David> gross
[19:21:49] <David> citizens united should stay
[19:21:50] <Rajoguna> ya and those interests are falling apart... Democrats are tired of not hearing a real liberal agenda for decades.
[19:21:52] <David> free speech
[19:21:57] <Rajoguna> its not free speech
[19:22:03] <Rajoguna> Citizens united should go
[19:22:12] <Rajoguna> its corrupted our political system
[19:22:18] <Rajoguna> id think as a liberterian you'd side with me on this.
[19:22:38] <Rajoguna> Surely you are at least against Super Pacs and shadow money?
[19:23:06] <Rajoguna> Also David the problem with citizen's united is it allows one perrsons voice to be more important than anothers.
[19:23:32] <Rajoguna> as a person can donate through their corperation millions. which would outweigh the free speech of thousands if not millions that are limited to only donating 2,700 USD
[19:24:00] <David> do I have the right to go out and buy an ad in my local newspaper for my favorite candidate?
[19:24:01] <Rajoguna> At the very least you admit that is not equal speech, right? 
[19:24:08] <David> without the government interfering?
[19:24:11] <Rajoguna> That isn't the same as donating millions.
[19:24:18] <David> well, how about this
[19:24:26] <Rajoguna> yes but you cant donate millions unless you own a big company, legally speakingt
[19:24:40] <Rajoguna> it would be illegal for y6ou as an individual to donate 2,701 dollars.
[19:24:43] *** Quits: Tez (uid126444@sorcery-9pi829.brockwell.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[19:24:54] <David> Do I have the right to partner with my buddy and pool our funds to buy an ad for our favorite candidate?
[19:24:55] <Rajoguna> but it would be if you had a company and you did it through the company or some puppet group you organized.
[19:25:01] <David> *sigh*
[19:25:08] <Rajoguna> David the money is coming from one person.
[19:25:18] <David> it's illegal for a candidate to accept that money
[19:25:27] <David> now
[19:25:31] <Rajoguna> But they do through Super PACs all the time
[19:25:38] <David> I think there does need to be more enforcement about the isolation between candidates and PACs
[19:26:02] <David> but PACs themselves are private organizations representing people with free speech rights, technically not affiliated with campaigns
[19:26:04] <Rajoguna> when your former staffers and friends head super pacs and a guy has his company donate well above the limit... its technically not his money but hes the voice thats being paid for there.
[19:26:25] <Rajoguna> they are not private, they are being headed by former staffers, friends, cousins ect
[19:26:41] <David> Well, ok
[19:26:44] <Rajoguna> and using massive amounts of funds given through corperations that is decided by boards of a few people
[19:26:48] <David> how about this
[19:26:54] <David> Let's say my mom is running for office
[19:27:02] <David> do I have the right to take out an ad in the newspaper to support her?
[19:27:11] <Rajoguna> david if the heads of a corperation lets say 100 people donate 10 million, thats still well above the limit per personj tahn individuals can give
[19:27:19] <David> you can't simply restrict people's free speech rights because they're close to candidates
[19:27:21] <Rajoguna> David you're missing the point.
[19:27:29] <Rajoguna> Im not saying that david
[19:27:37] <Rajoguna> im saying that poor people's free speech is restricted by laws
[19:27:53] <David> it's not
[19:27:56] <David> jesus
[19:27:58] <Rajoguna> and restricted by lack of resources. if you are denying that rich people simply have more weight and more speech than poor people your deluding yourself.
[19:28:01] <David> they have the same rights that anyone does
[19:28:12] <Rajoguna> NO THEY DONT THEY HAVE MORE RIGHTS THEY LITERALLY HAVE MORE RIGHT TO DONATE MORE
[19:28:21] <David> by that logic you could also say that poor people's right to freedom of movement is restricted by their inability to buy an airline ticket
[19:28:23] <Rajoguna> what is this Animal Farm?
[19:28:41] <David> or that their right to bear arms is infringed by the fact that guns cost money
[19:28:42] <Rajoguna> its limited by the law
[19:28:47] <VerifiedShitlady> FOUR FEET GOOD TWO FEET BAD
[19:28:48] <Rajoguna> they are limited by laws
[19:29:05] <Rajoguna> they are limited by the way the system is set up its literally illegal for them to do so unless they own a big company
[19:29:19] * David facepalms
[19:29:22] <Rajoguna> let me put it another way; owning a company creates a loophole to allow one to donate more than they should be allowed to.
[19:29:23] <David> it's not
[19:29:26] <David> you don't get it, do you?
[19:29:28] <VerifiedShitlady> I want to reread Animal Farm
[19:29:38] <David> I can donate any amount I want to any superpac
[19:29:38] <David> anyone can
[19:29:49] <David> you don't need to own a company to donate to one
[19:29:52] <Rajoguna> but you cant own that super pac
[19:30:01] <Rajoguna> and choose what it says
[19:30:16] <trapped> hey david, i wanna do CRISPR cheap and possibly @ home, how2
[19:30:31] <David> Anyone can make their own superpac
[19:30:55] <Rajoguna> david only supports them as he wants to be one oneday
[19:31:01] <David> trapped: I doubt you can.... lab equipment isn't cheap
[19:31:01] <David> hell, genome sequencing devices are still expensive
[19:31:34] <trapped> i'd just use yeast
[19:31:59] <trapped> i just want to add a couple proteins to metabolize some LSD precursors
[19:32:04] <trapped> into lsd that is
[19:32:58] <David> Rajoguna: if you want to understand why, read the court's opinion in citizens united
[19:33:08] <Rajoguna> They were wrong.
[19:33:13] <trapped> http://www.gizmag.com/home-crispr-gene-editing-kit/40362/
[19:33:26] <David> In this conversation you've demonstrated that you don't even understand how a superpac works
[19:33:52] <David> <Rajoguna> they are limited by the way the system is set up its literally illegal for them to do so unless they own a big company
[19:33:55] <Rajoguna> And you've demonstrated you don't know how money corrupts politics.
[19:34:01] <Rajoguna> David that's true though.
[19:34:11] <Rajoguna> there is a limit of 2,700 USd any individual can donate to a canidate
[19:34:15] <David> is blatantly incorrect, for one
[19:34:18] <Rajoguna> no its not
[19:34:20] <Rajoguna> look it up
[19:34:32] <David> I give up
[19:34:34] <David> I'm not going to argue facts with someone who refuses to accept them
[19:34:36] <Rajoguna> Super PACs are a way around that yes.
[19:34:40] <Rajoguna> and that's the issue.
[19:34:48] <David> and donating to a candidate != donating to an independent superpac
[19:34:48] <Rajoguna> david listen to me
[19:34:53] <Rajoguna> THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT
[19:34:57] <Rajoguna> they just are on paper
[19:35:01] <Rajoguna> they never are in practice
[19:35:26] <Rajoguna> and this has been proven thats why it keeps being headed by former staffers, family, friends ect they always conviently provide on their sites too the canidates
[19:35:26] <David> and I agree, that's a problem
[19:35:35] <Rajoguna> promo stuff in its raw form for super pacs to use
[19:35:38] <David> but I'd rather se stricter enforcement of separation between pacs and campaigns
[19:35:45] <David> sort of like lobbyist laws
[19:35:45] <David> rather than just banning them
[19:36:08] <Rajoguna> That's not a typical liberterian position is it? More regulation and more money in politics? I thought libeterians wanted less regulation and less bought interests.
[19:36:57] <David> By and large, it is.

[19:38:01] <David> http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/free-speech-all
[19:38:13] <Rajoguna> So why are you going against the libertarian stances? I think David, you're not really a Liberterian, just pro money, becuase you want to be rich.

[19:38:26] <David> erm
[19:38:35] <David> I'm saying that it *is* a libertarian position to support citizens united
[19:38:41] <David> read the links
[19:38:47] <Rajoguna> That's been the theme I've seen you don't seem to focus on the personal freedom aspects of liberterianism.
[19:38:53] <David> I don't think you can argue that the cato institute and the aclu are not libertarian institutions

[21:01:52] <Lajjla> VerifiedShitlady, sweetie, do yu think Disney's Tarzan was racist because Tarzan has dreadlocks while being white without being invited into black culture by black people.
[21:02:10] <VerifiedShitlady> No
[21:02:22] <VerifiedShitlady> He was in the jungle and didn't have a comb
[21:02:30] <Lajjla> Yeah
[21:02:32] <Lajjla> That was my idea.
[21:02:42] <Lajjla> But these people on this Pow's law blog insist it is racist.
[21:03:05] <Lajjla> VerifiedShitlady, you think it's racist though if he purposefully styled it like that while being white and not being invited to black culture/
[21:03:17] <VerifiedShitlady> Yes
[21:03:19] <VerifiedShitlady> But
[21:03:30] <VerifiedShitlady> He didn't do it on purpose
[21:03:34] <VerifiedShitlady> He was a savage
[21:04:04] <Lajjla> A noble savage, though.
[21:04:16] <Lajjla> I like how in the disney film they removed all the cool racist elements from the book.
[21:04:26] <VerifiedShitlady> A savage nonetheless
[21:04:28] <Lajjla> Like in the book, Jane was not the first human being he saw but the first WHITE human being.
[21:04:50] <VerifiedShitlady> Who wrote the book?
[21:05:13] <Lajjla> One Edgar Rice Burroughs
[21:05:32] <Lajjla> It's actually quite recent, 1912
[21:06:09] <Lajjla> 'Clayton is named "Tarzan" ("White Skin" in the ape language) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage.'
[21:06:10] <Lajjla> Ehehe
[21:06:24] <Lajjla> 'Subsequently, a new party of whites is marooned on the coast, including Jane Porter, the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen.'
[21:14:48] <VerifiedShitlady> >Clayton
[21:15:00] <VerifiedShitlady> Mfw I'd rather be called Tarzan
[21:16:41] <Lajjla> VerifiedShitlady, but do you have white skin?
[21:19:38] <Trynity> No he's black
[21:21:09] <Lajjla> Trynity, good.
[21:21:13] <Lajjla> Having white skin would be racist

[21:22:52] <Trynity> ;_;
[21:22:56] <Trynity> Nah
[21:23:39] <Ccomp5950> Trying to remember, I remember having a conversation in #gaycafe saying if you are a channel op and get network banned for kicking an ircop to send logs to kline@, did me and you have a seperate conversation?
[21:24:08] <Trynity> Oh, I must've misunderstood then
[21:24:24] <Trynity> I thought you meant if he acted unprofessional in any way then
[21:25:45] <VerifiedShitlady> Ugh
[21:25:51] <VerifiedShitlady> Carter took my spot
[21:27:13] <Ccomp5950> If acting unprofessional was a means to get someone delisted we would have....maybe 2 IRCops, no server admins...wait Boop would still be good, she's got the patience of a saint (comes with being a school teacher)...
[21:27:49] <Ccomp5950> So yeah.  being a jerk isn't a disqualifier, using network powers to be a jerk, is.
[21:27:59] <Trynity> I guess, but consistently talking shit and being an asshole...

[21:55:32] <VerifiedShitlady> It's like 4 pm here
[21:55:52] <VerifiedShitlady> FUCK YES NO CURFEW FROM TOMORROW ON
[21:56:38] <Lajjla> Oh yes, Americatime.
[21:56:44] <Lajjla> 5 hours in the past on social issues and stuff
[21:56:49] <Lajjla> Your same sex marriage was five hours later.
[21:57:09] <VerifiedShitlady> Wut
[21:59:10] <Lajjla> Well, US had same sex marriage later than we.
[21:59:16] <Lajjla> VerifiedShitlady, wait wait.
[21:59:22] <Lajjla> LEt me explain, it's really funny how it works here.
[21:59:53] <VerifiedShitlady> Ok
[21:59:53] <Lajjla> Like, the name of the child right, the "default" is that the child gets the last name of the mother unless the mother is married to someone, then it gets the name of the person whom she's married to.
[22:00:06] <Lajjla> THt was something that existed when same sex marraige did not exist, and they ept it.
[22:00:09] <VerifiedShitlady> Since when
[22:00:28] <VerifiedShitlady> ain't no Carter in my family besides my son
[22:00:36] <Lajjla> So now you have a case if two women are married and they get a child and one carries it that by default the child gets the last name of the person it is guarenteed to not be biologicall related to.
[22:00:40] <Lajjla> Which I find humorous.
[22:00:45] <Lajjla> Nonon, I mean here.
[22:00:46] <Lajjla> Netherlands.
[22:00:59] <VerifiedShitlady> Do you mean last name?
[22:01:15] <Lajjla> Yes.
[22:01:17] <Lajjla> Family name.
[22:01:28] <VerifiedShitlady> Ahh
[22:01:29] <VerifiedShitlady> Yeah
[22:01:50] <VerifiedShitlady> In America they might hyphenate the names
[22:01:51] <Lajjla> Oh I should probably add that in the Netherlands if you get married you do not adopt the name of your spouse, there's actually no legal way to do that.
[22:02:15] <Lajjla> Well, the parents can always choose whose last name the baby gets, this is just the default situation when they make no choice.
[22:02:34] <Lajjla> IF the mother is not wed, the child gets the last name of the mother, i she is, the last name of the person whom she's wed to, biological father or not.
[22:03:59] <VerifiedShitlady> So el kiddo would get mama #2s name
[22:04:06] <VerifiedShitlady> If lesbo couple
