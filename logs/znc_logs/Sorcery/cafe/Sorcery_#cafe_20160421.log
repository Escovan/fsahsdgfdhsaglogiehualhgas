[04:08:15] <Rajoguna> Voting day was plagued with enormous problems, leading to widespread accusations of voter suppression and disenfranchisement.
[04:08:15] <Rajoguna> Since last fall, the New York Board of Elections mysteriously purged more than 125,000 Brooklyn Democrats from the voting records without their knowledge.
[04:08:15] <Rajoguna> Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged that there had been “purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters from the voting lists.”
[04:08:18] <Rajoguna> The New York City watchdog, Comptroller Scott Stringer, said all of this happened “without any adequate explanation furnished by the Board of Elections.”
[04:08:21] <Rajoguna> There were also countless reports that residents were given wrong voting information, people were sent to wrong polling locations, voters were forced to fill out affidavit ballots that may not count, poll workers did not know how to operate the voting machines and voting machines were broken.
[04:08:47] <Rajoguna> for those thinking this is biased there is also an article on the front page being critical of the sanders campaign
[04:09:05] <Rajoguna> "The complaint hotline was flooded with 468 percent more complaints than in the 2012 primary. The office said it was “by far the largest volume of complaints we have received for an election since” since Attorney General Eric Schneiderman entered his position."
[04:09:15] <Rajoguna> gee this all looks almost as if it was organized or planmned
[04:09:25] <Rajoguna> it's arizona all over again, but worse
[04:09:57] <Rajoguna> looks like in response stringer is auditing the NYC's Board of Elections

[06:46:56] <Demisedulous> a clip from one of my nightmares
[06:47:26] <Demisedulous> I grew up on a farm, see
[06:48:06] <Lajjla> I did not.
[06:48:16] <Lajjla> But I have long hair, do you?
[06:48:21] <Demisedulous> oh yeah
[06:48:26] <Demisedulous> long and fluffy
[06:48:37] <Demisedulous> Iunno why I'm growing it again
[06:48:48] <Lajjla> Demisedulous, how long are we talking about?
[06:49:10] <Demisedulous> bangs are down to my lower lip
[06:49:23] <Demisedulous> the rest is nearing my sholders
[06:49:30] <Demisedulous> it's really thick, 
[06:49:47] <Demisedulous> like I must have a million hairs on my head
[06:50:07] <Demisedulous> there's prolly half a foot of hair sticking out on either side of my head
[06:50:11] <Demisedulous> wings, I think they call em

[06:52:18] <Lajjla> I have one when I eat
[06:52:24] <Lajjla> Rarely when I sleep
[06:53:15] <Demisedulous> Nothing wrong with functional ponytails
[06:53:44] <Demisedulous> it's just, I vividly recall a nightmare in where I was tugging on this ponytail
[06:53:56] <Demisedulous> and then I eventually happened across a bloody piece of scalp
[06:53:59] <Demisedulous> at the end of it
[06:54:08] <Demisedulous> then a bunch of horses laughed at me
