[19:58:22] <VerifiedShitlady> Hi
[19:58:35] <Edward> Hi
[19:58:43] <VerifiedShitlady> Not you
[19:58:48] * Edward cries
[20:04:41] <VerifiedShitlady> Ccomp5950: 
[20:05:07] <VerifiedShitlady> Is it against net rules to make false claims about another user to admin?
[20:05:43] <Edward> Its against the law
[20:06:00] <VerifiedShitlady> Libel and slander, ye?
[20:06:42] <Moose> this is the internet, like anyone gives a damn
[20:06:58] <VerifiedShitlady> People do, enough to ban me
[20:06:59] <Edward> I give a damn Moo
[20:07:01] <Edward> I give a damn..
[20:07:04] <VerifiedShitlady> Moo
[20:07:06] <VerifiedShitlady> Rude
[20:07:29] <VerifiedShitlady> Kek
[20:08:32] <Edward> Moo said I could call her/he that
[20:08:39] <Edward> Its a he, right?
[20:08:55] <VerifiedShitlady> Moose is a he
[20:09:04] <Edward> Good ol' Moo
[20:11:09] <Ccomp5950> VerifiedShitlady: who is this about, PM me if you want.
[20:11:57] <VerifiedShitlady> Dearg made claims on another network that I was harassing her here
[20:12:04] <VerifiedShitlady> Here, she is on ignore
[20:13:34] <Edward> I dont think that admin on this network can do anything about what dearg says on another network
[20:13:35] <Edward> Just sayin
[20:13:52] <VerifiedShitlady> Hush little Edward
[20:14:08] <Edward> VerifiedShitlady..... y u do dis
[20:14:23] <VerifiedShitlady> hush with your logic
[20:14:34] <Edward> hahaha
[20:14:44] <VerifiedShitlady> Because I have to pee
[20:14:51] <Edward> Alright
[20:14:54] <Edward> Have fun with that
[20:15:14] <VerifiedShitlady> Ty
[20:15:24] <Edward>  No, thank you
[20:15:26] <Edward> For being a friend
[20:16:02] <VerifiedShitlady> Yw
[20:18:23] <David> VerifiedShitlady: >on another network
[20:18:31] *** David sets mode: -o David
[20:18:47] <VerifiedShitlady> Well
[20:18:52] <David> you're asking Ccomp5950 to help you with someone who did something to you on another network?
[20:19:00] <VerifiedShitlady> I wanted to know if it's generally against irc rules
[20:19:25] <VerifiedShitlady> Nope
[20:19:33] <VerifiedShitlady> Pure curiosity
[20:19:40] <David> each place has their own rules
[20:19:45] <David> there are no universal "irc rules" just as there are no "internet rules" or "email rules"
[20:20:03] <VerifiedShitlady> No unspoken rules?
[20:20:20] <VerifiedShitlady> Er unwritten rules
[20:21:23] <David> any random out there can spin up their own irc server and do whatever they want with thim
[20:21:23] <David> they can even run it as a tinpot dictatorship if they want :)
[20:21:25] <Ccomp5950> VerifiedShitlady: there is no blacket policy "X said Y was being mean to them and 'harrassing' them on another network" is going to be met with a "okay, do you have evidence?"
[20:21:48] <Ccomp5950> it's going to be handled on a case by case basis, I've not heard anything about any of this until you told me though.
[20:21:52] <Ccomp5950> so, quit sweating it
[20:22:19] <VerifiedShitlady> I was just curious :)
