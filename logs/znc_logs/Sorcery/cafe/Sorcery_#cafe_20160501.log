[13:53:37] <Lajjla> trapped, I hear that's what men do or something
[13:53:47] <Lajjla> And remember, men can't ever be raped or sexually harassed by a woman in any way
[13:54:08] <Lajjla> This is because men want sex all the time with any woman.
[13:54:26] <trapped> i guess
[13:54:28] <Pomegranate> ^
[13:55:17] <trapped> now i've gotta prepare myself to try and reason with my mates that for sure will blast my balls for that
[13:55:39] <Pomegranate> You were intoxicated
[13:56:07] <trapped> so what
[13:56:11] <trapped> im always intoxicated
[13:56:27] <Pomegranate> Eh fair enough
[13:57:46] <trapped> i'm just gonna straight tell em that i simply had no interest in someone i didn't know who came up to me and bluntly tried to talk to me out of the blue
[13:59:20] <Pomegranate> MY BOOB HURTS
[13:59:35] * trapped massages the boob
[13:59:38] <trapped> now massage my balls
[13:59:56] <Pomegranate> Awww yisss
[14:01:56] <Lajjla> trapped, and in the US that loses you status, right?
[14:02:17] <trapped> dunno, im not american
[14:02:48] <trapped> and i'm not even sure "status" is a thing here
[14:03:08] <trapped> i think it pretty much boils down to who you're friends with and vice versa
[14:05:58] <Lajjla> trapped, so why do you need to explain yourself to them?
[14:06:02] <Lajjla> Like they arranged that for you?
[14:06:08] <trapped> no
[14:06:11] <trapped> but they're normies
[14:06:26] <trapped> they're the kind of people who match the "<Lajjla> This is because men want sex all the time with any woman." standard
[14:07:27] <Lajjla> Sounds like fun friends.
[14:07:39] <trapped> eh i only got those
[14:07:58] <Lajjla> This is why I have no friends
[14:08:00] <Lajjla> And I like it
[14:08:07] <trapped> tfw no gf
[14:10:26] <Lajjla> Dn't have one of those either
[14:10:28] <Lajjla> Like that as well
[14:31:56] <Rajoguna_> hey guys
[14:32:08] <Rajoguna_> david warned me this guy im letting stay at my houes might try to do something bad like make meth
[14:32:26] <Rajoguna_> just some guy that just got out of jail and was homeless
[14:32:36] <Pomegranate> Nothing bad about that
[14:33:24] <Rajoguna_> he did over 5 years
[14:33:32] <Rajoguna_> anywhos no meth
[14:33:39] <Rajoguna_> mostly just talk about vegetarianism
[14:33:41] <Rajoguna_> and buddhism
[14:34:42] <Pomegranate> Why was he incarcerated
[14:35:58] <Rajoguna_> doing silly stuff when drunk
[14:36:27] <Pomegranate> Ah
[14:36:28] <Rajoguna_> breaking and entering a buisness
[14:36:32] <Rajoguna_> from what i can tell
[14:43:08] <Lajjla> That sounds like a crime in a lot of places.
