[00:11:36] <Lajjla> It does/
[00:11:39] <Lajjla> However so?
[00:12:23] <zipfelkapuze> i think it sounds like a girl who lies on a hill on a sunny day
[00:12:44] <zipfelkapuze> with closed eyes
[00:12:50] <zipfelkapuze> and smiling
[00:13:22] <Lajjla> I had no idea.
[00:13:30] <Lajjla> I found out at one point it's an Arabic name.
[00:13:36] <zipfelkapuze> which country are you from?
[00:13:45] <Lajjla> That is very much not me though, I avoid sunlight like the plague.
[00:13:47] <Lajjla> Netherlands.
[00:13:58] <zipfelkapuze> ah, i have been there last year
