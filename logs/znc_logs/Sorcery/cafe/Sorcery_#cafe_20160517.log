[00:12:39] <Tryn> Allo
[00:12:57] <zipfelkapuze> ah
[00:13:25] <zipfelkapuze> is this shoegaze: https://brokenworldmedia.bandcamp.com/track/hair-of-the-dog ? Just to make sure i understand what the genre is about
[00:14:35] <Tryn> More or less, yes, but it def has a more harsh punk vibe
[00:14:48] <Tryn> But it does have the lush guitar textures and tons of effects
[00:15:02] <Tryn> You also reminded me that I haven't checked bandcamp in ages
[00:15:32] <zipfelkapuze> thank you
[00:20:58] <Tryn> https://ztapes.bandcamp.com/album/desert-dreams
[00:21:02] <Tryn> A bit raw, but cute
[00:21:03] <Tryn> I like it
[00:30:33] <zipfelkapuze> i like "Moving Day" from it
[00:31:06] <Tryn> tbh, I just skim through the songs, and if I like what I hear, I download it
[00:31:36] <Tryn> https://westkust.bandcamp.com/album/last-forever
