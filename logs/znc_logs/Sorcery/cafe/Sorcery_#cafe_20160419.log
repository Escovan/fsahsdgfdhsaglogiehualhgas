[07:33:58] <Escovan> hi
[07:34:11] * Escovan drinks coffee
[08:04:44] <Lajjla> Winners don't take drugs.
[08:15:01] <Escovan> And if they´re prescribed?
[08:17:25] <Escovan> Yes, time to get dressed and annoy some frogs in #ingress
[08:18:20] <trapped> would you drink bleach if it was prescribed
[08:18:25] <Lajjla> That would be perfectly in line with american morality.
[08:18:27] <Lajjla> Hmm
[08:18:41] <Lajjla> I would probably defer to the expertise of a doctor who praescribed it and told me it was needed and/or sae.
[08:19:56] <trapped> got up at 630am to finish reading this fucking serbian novel
[08:20:04] <Escovan> I can actually read you know. I do know what prescribtion drugs I take. And I know what happens if I don´t.

[21:51:00] <David> "Ross Medical Education Center in Flint is by far the worst and most disappointing school that I have ever attended. They have a lack of professionalism and only care about their students until after orientation, when they are locked into their financial agreement. After they know that they get your money, the respect goes right down the tubes. I would not recommend this school to anyone."
