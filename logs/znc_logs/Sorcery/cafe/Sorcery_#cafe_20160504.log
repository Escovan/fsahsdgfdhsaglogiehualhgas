[00:01:38] <Trynity> I am fairly hunngry
[00:01:53] <Trynity> But I was thinking about going to something like Taco Bell or Rosetta's Kitchen to eat
[00:02:08] <Pomegranate> I want Taco Bell
[00:02:17] <Trynity> Same actually
[00:02:20] <Trynity> And it's super cheap
[00:02:28] <Trynity> The cafe I'm in is too expensive
[00:02:37] <Trynity> tbh I'm surprised I found myself here

[00:12:52] <Lajjla> Trynity, where do yous tand on the one drop rule sweetie/
[00:14:11] <Trynity> ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?
[00:14:19] <Trynity> Like, one drop of black blood is bad or?
[00:15:09] <Lajjla> Trynity, no, one drop of blac bood makes you "black"
[00:15:21] <Lajjla> As in Obama is black and Colin Powell is black
[00:15:27] <Trynity> I think the whole concept is ridiculous
[00:16:46] <Lajjla> Trynity, apparently as early as the 1950's, people from the united states who thought themselves "black" went to france and to their surprise they were considered white there
[00:17:11] <Trynity> I didn't actually know that
[00:17:15] <Trynity> I knew the one drop rule
[00:17:23] <Trynity> But not that people like that went to France
[00:18:54] <Lajjla> Well, some were bound to.
[00:19:28] <Lajjla> But it's pretty absurd how in the US some people who are like 15/16 white are still considered "black" sometimes and like they embrace it often.
[00:19:38] <Lajjla> THat's the weird part, the minorities seem just as fine with it and celebrate the idea.
[00:19:46] <Trynity> Not any more, more or less
[00:19:53] <Lajjla> They re not like "Yo, dude, I'm like more white than black, that's racist man."
[00:20:11] <Lajjla> but they'relike "Yeah, I'm totally blac because my great grandfather was."
[00:20:15] <Trynity> I mean, you get those 'my great great great great grandmother's friend's boyfriend's wife was native therefore I am too'
[00:20:45] <Trynity> I also just realized that that implies that the boyfriend was cheating
[00:20:50] <Trynity> I should think before I type
[00:21:10] <Lajjla> Monogamy is outdated anyway
[00:21:31] <Trynity> Well, this hypothetical boyfriend was from at least 100 years ago anyways so
[00:24:51] <Pomegranate> Can I die
