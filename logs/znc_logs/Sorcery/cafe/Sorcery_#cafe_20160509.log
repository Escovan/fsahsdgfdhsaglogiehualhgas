[20:31:43] <David> trapped: do you prefer gelato from buffalo milk or gelato from cow milk
[20:32:02] <trapped> again, let me repeat this to you
[20:32:19] <trapped> buffalo milk is not available to consumers in italy
[20:32:26] <David> not even in gelato form?
[20:32:27] <David> jeez
[20:32:32] <David> you should move to 'murica
[20:32:37] <trapped> i know right
[20:32:41] <trapped> i can't find a fucking avocado
[20:32:44] <trapped> i want guacamole
[20:32:56] <trapped> ah i wanted to ask you a thing David 
[20:33:34] <trapped> do you know anyone who knows some chemistry? i'd like to know how to separate benzydamine from sodium chloride
[20:33:44] <David> no, not personally
[20:33:55] <David> I used to know one guy who did quantum chemistry
[20:33:58] <David> but that's probably not what you're looking for
[20:34:10] <trapped> nope
[20:34:14] <David> actually my mom used to be a chemist before she became an electrical engineer
[20:34:37] <David> but I don't think she remembers this stuff
[20:35:03] <David> Recreational use[edit]
[20:35:03] <David> Benzydamine has been used recreationally. In overdosages it acts a deliriant and CNS stimulant.[4] Such use, particularly among teenagers, has been reported in Poland,[4] Brazil[5][6] and Romania.
[20:35:12] <David> weed not enough for you trapped?
[20:35:15] <trapped> no
[20:35:26] <trapped> read the nsaids page
[20:35:47] <trapped> it has anticholinergic ffects
[20:36:33] <David> "Anticholinergic drugs are usually considered the least enjoyable by many recreational drug users,[4] possibly due to the lack of euphoria caused by them."
[20:36:44] <David> ah well trapped 
[20:36:54] <David> scraping the bottom of the drug barrel?
[20:36:57] <trapped> thats why u mix em with other drugs
[20:37:13] <trapped> to be honest
[20:37:24] <David> classic trappde
[20:37:29] <trapped> its more about "i wanna try and make myself some synthetic drugs"
[20:37:58] <trapped> also i can buy 500mg benzydamine for 1eur and sell 1500mg for 10
[20:41:05] <trapped> btw david
[20:41:13] <trapped> i finally have my finals
[20:41:33] <trapped> if all goes as hoped i'll actually manage to graduate
[20:41:37] <trapped> aint it great
[20:42:38] <Sutch> then u can get ur masters in being a fucken druggo
[20:43:04] <trapped> i wish i was an organic chemist
[20:43:08] <David> I have one more final project due today
[20:43:09] <David> and I'm done
[20:43:13] <David> for the semester
[20:43:47] <trapped> i had a preliminar "admission" exam 23 to 27 may, then actual final during last 2 weeks of june
[20:44:35] <David> to where
[20:45:15] <trapped> what?
[20:45:28] <trapped> may 23 to 27
[20:45:30] <trapped> fine
[20:45:52] <trapped> also "i have"
[20:46:04] <trapped> you can guess i'm high
[20:47:39] <David> what school are you trying to get admitted to
[20:47:59] <trapped> the admission is to the final exam itself
[20:48:18] <David> wut
[20:48:20] <trapped> universities don't have admission exams in italy
[20:48:23] <trapped> only medicine
[20:58:24] <David> so why do you need to take a test to take another test
[20:58:24] <David> also
[20:58:43] <David> how do you know which olive oil is real olive oil and which one is faked by the mafia
[21:00:22] <trapped> i make olive oil by myself
[21:00:43] <trapped> my uncle has this sort of garden idk with some 500 olive trees
[21:00:56] <trapped> and every so often i help him making it into oil
[21:05:46] <trapped> brb
[21:09:32] <David> what type of olive press do you use
[21:09:55] <David> parents are doing a backyard remodel, wonder if I could convince them to put in a few olive trees
[21:13:26] <Ccomp5950> 420 smoke sneks everyday:  slither.io
[21:13:31] <David> lol
[21:13:36] <David> that's a fun game
[21:13:42] <Ccomp5950> (Think agar.io but with sneks)
[21:13:43] <David> longest I ever got was 34k or so
[21:13:50] <Ccomp5950> made 55k the other day
[21:13:56] <David> damn, sweet
[21:14:04] <Ccomp5950> second longest has been 20k
[21:14:11] <David> I normally get up to 5-10k easily
[21:14:12] <Ccomp5950> give or take a 1k
[21:14:20] <David> just loitering around the center zapping big sneks
[21:14:36] <Ccomp5950> Yeah I can get up to the 8k range pretty easily, after that it's either go to the middle and hope the traffic jam is in your favor or spend a fuck ton of time on the sides.
[21:14:50] <Ccomp5950> My usual strategy is while small to be in the middle and eat up the traffic jams
[21:14:52] <David> the ones coiling around others are stupidly easy to kill
[21:14:54] <Ccomp5950> then move further out
[21:15:05] <David> if you orbit them on the outside
[21:15:08] <Ccomp5950> yeah my favorite is killing the super huge ones when I'm only 1/4 their size
[21:15:12] <Ccomp5950> just coil them
[21:15:27] <David> no, I mean killing the orbiters :)
[21:15:28] <Ccomp5950> buuut.  You can get coiled then
[21:15:30] <Ccomp5950> oh
[21:15:43] <Ccomp5950> yeah anyone that hangs around the "face" is going to get raced repeatedly
[21:15:46] <David> they're being pressed by the ones they're coiling around and by you on the outside
[21:15:46] <David> naw, if thy get aggressive dash away
[21:15:53] <Ccomp5950> anything not 1/2 my size I'm just going to go to the outside
[21:16:35] <David> frankly I find the most fun part of the game to be killing big sneks
[21:16:41] <David> to hell with growing
[21:16:50] <David> getting to ~5k and going after everyone on the top10 list
[21:17:41] <Ccomp5950> yase
