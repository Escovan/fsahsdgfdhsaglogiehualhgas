[02:42:21] <Trynity> Because holy fuck you have never been so goddamn retarded
[02:42:26] <Trynity> It's making me angry
[02:44:29] <David> well, sorry trynity, it's not like we can pull magical culinary solutions from a hat
[02:44:41] <David> all I can do is make suggestions based on my own cooking
[02:45:42] <Trynity> You can at least read back 5 minutes to make sure what you're suggesting works with what I have available and I haven't already shot down
[02:48:03] <David> so let me recap
[02:48:18] <David> vegetarian, no fresh vegetables, no heating source, no refrigeration, and no canned foods?
[02:49:00] <Trynity> More or less
[02:50:24] <David> problem is I don't see how you can maintain the necessary vegetable intake without canning
[02:50:46] <David> unless you're willing to take in hardy vegetables (carrots, tomatoes, etc) that last a few days without refrigeration
[02:50:58] <Demisedulous> Eat flowers and grass
[02:51:10] <Demisedulous> Leaves too, like littlefoot did
[02:58:27] <Trynity> I'm not a cow
[03:00:00] <David> nah, but you should eat one
[03:00:07] <David> ;)
[03:00:25] <David> actually, got any access to pickled vegetables?
[03:00:40] <Demisedulous> Ohh pickled ANYTHING is delicious!
[03:00:41] <David> you can get things like canned lotus root and make salads with those

[03:05:46] <Trynity> I have NEVER heard of canned lotus root
[03:05:47] <Demisedulous> Edward confirmed faggot
[03:05:48] <Trynity> Also allo Cetu 
[03:05:59] <Edward> I am indeed a bundle of sticks, Demisedulous 
[03:06:05] <Demisedulous> I always knew it!
[03:06:05] <Cetu> IMA BE AN ESCORT
[03:06:09] <Trynity> But are you a cute bundle of sticks?
[03:06:11] <Trynity> Do it
[03:06:19] <Demisedulous> Isn't that exciting, Cetu 
[03:06:24] <Trynity> Remember, you get bigger tips if you don't wear a condom
[03:06:26] <Edward> Cetu is going to bang her way to the top
[03:06:41] <Cetu> Bigger tips ;^]
[03:06:49] <Cetu> Nice pun
[03:07:20] <David> yeah, bigger tits and paying tens (if not hundreds) of thousands for HIV treatment for the rest of your life
[03:07:26] <David> tips*
[03:07:27] <David> dammit
[03:07:33] <Cetu> TITS
[03:07:44] <Trynity> We know what's on Demi's mind
[03:07:47] <David> Ah well, that works too
[03:07:48] <Cetu> David pls
[03:07:52] <Cetu> Medicaid
[03:07:56] <David> great
[03:08:00] <David> you're taking MY TAX DOLLARS
[03:08:04] <David> as Trynity is wont to say
[03:08:10] <David> REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[03:08:10] <Cetu> GOOD
[03:08:25] <Demisedulous> B O O B 
[03:08:36] <Cetu> LMFAO
[03:08:45] <Cetu> I E S
[03:09:19] <David> also
[03:09:21] <David> why the nick change
[03:09:24] <Demisedulous> So where're you escorting and why, Cetu?
[03:09:24] <Cetu> Ima be making tax free money
[03:09:31] <David> >tax free
[03:09:35] <Cetu> CUZ I NEED AN INCOME
[03:09:36] <David> i'm going to report you to the irs
[03:09:40] <Cetu> GOOD
[03:09:45] <Demisedulous> More customers
[03:09:50] <Trynity> Just say you got the money doing odd jobs
[03:09:51] <David> >taking medicaid
[03:09:51] <Cetu> DO IT
[03:09:53] <David> >not paying taxes
[03:09:56] <Demisedulous> All those pent up business men
[03:09:59] <David> and Trynity, odd jobs are taxable too :)
[03:10:01] <Trynity> Pretty sure that you don't have to incriminate yourself
[03:10:05] <Trynity> Yea, yea
[03:10:09] <Trynity> You're still taxed
[03:10:13] <David> Trynity: you can fill out 'fourth amendment' in the tax return
[03:10:15] <Cetu> Demisedulous: exactly
[03:10:15] <Trynity> So you don't get in IRS trouble
[03:10:18] <Trynity> Yea
[03:10:31] <Trynity> That's what all the kool kids do
[03:10:34] <David> the supreme court has decided that even if you run an illegal operation you still need to pay tax on it
[03:10:54] <Cetu> Kek
[03:11:05] <Trynity> Better than going to prison
[03:11:09] <David> but the irs won't let those records be used against you, and you can always put in 'fifth amendment"
[03:11:14] <Trynity> Also you support the system of which you're mooching off of
[03:11:33] <Cetu> Cop: "you're under arrest for not paying taxes on your meth lab"
[03:11:37] <Demisedulous> More importantly
[03:11:39] <Demisedulous> what're your rates
[03:11:50] <Cetu> Cop: "but not for having a meth lab"
[03:12:13] <Trynity> $5 handjob, $10 blowjob, $25 anal, $30 vaginal
[03:12:14] <Cetu> $100/lap dance
[03:12:20] <Trynity> No condom nee>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
[03:12:22] <Trynity> Cetu bb pls
[03:12:31] <Trynity> $100 is the usual going price for anal
[03:12:35] <Trynity> You're not some high end escort
[03:13:03] <Demisedulous> I better get a frea 4 star meal with a $100 lap dance
[03:13:05] <Demisedulous> q.q
[03:13:21] <Demisedulous> We kid, though
[03:13:26] <Trynity> I don't
[03:13:28] <Trynity> I hate kids
[03:13:36] <Demisedulous> Find out what other escorts in your area are charging then undercut em
[03:13:46] <Trynity> She lives in like, fucking Flint or w/e

[03:14:06] <Trynity> W/e
[03:14:17] <Demisedulous> Oh nvm

[03:14:29] <Demisedulous> At the mention of flint I thought cetu was pomm with yet another name

[03:14:32] <Trynity> Still stands
[03:14:37] <David> [18:12:18] <Demisedulous> I better get a frea 4 star meal with a $100 lap dance
[03:14:37] <Trynity> DEMI
[03:14:39] <Cetu> STILL NOT FLINT

[03:21:44] <Demisedulous> Don't die, cetu
[03:22:06] <Demisedulous> Being an escort is dangerous
[03:25:45] <Trynity> Be careful and don't be stupid and it's fine
[03:25:53] <Trynity> Always have them at your place, never at theirs
[03:25:58] <Trynity> Provide your own condoms
[03:26:03] <Trynity> Have safety measures in place
