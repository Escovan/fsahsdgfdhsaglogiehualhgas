[19:33:35] <ForestFox> How much got through
[19:33:44] <Quadpod88> abit
[19:34:00] <Quadpod88> which is why it auto kicked you

[19:34:23] <ForestFox> [12:31] <ForestFox> So noisy in here
[19:34:39] <Quadpod88> wow
[19:34:57] <Quadpod88> also, just fyi
[19:35:36] <Quadpod88> it's against the rules to advertise other servers
[19:35:51] <ForestFox> Channels i knew
[19:36:02] <ForestFox> And im not advertising
[19:36:41] <Quadpod88> i know, but it may be construed otherwise
[19:36:41] <ForestFox> Merely pointing out that theres s massive channel thats dead
[19:36:51] <ForestFox> Theyll live
[19:37:35] <ForestFox> If i were adverting it id be telling you how great it is, not how dead it is
[19:38:32] <Quadpod88> yeah, but i hate ppl getting kicked for misunderstanding
[19:40:33] <ForestFox> Its not like im a regular anyway
[19:41:23] <Quadpod88> yeah, but we like new ppl
[19:42:12] <Quadpod88> opportunity for tolerance and all that
[19:43:54] <ForestFox> Not exactly new either
[19:44:31] <ForestFox> I forget how strict they are
[19:45:03] <ForestFox> And since flooding is kicked by the bot, its not known what ratio its set at
[19:45:28] <Quadpod88> not really, just simple rules
[19:46:35] <ForestFox> When itd just be easier to set flooding kick on the channel settings
[19:47:02] <Quadpod88> above my level
[19:47:38] <ForestFox> Its not that hard
[19:48:22] <Quadpod88> i usually avoid tech stuff
[19:48:27] <ForestFox> 47]  f [*][lines]:[sec] Kicks on text flood equal to or above the
[19:48:28] <ForestFox> [12:47]                     specified rate. With *, the user is banned
[19:48:28] <ForestFox> [12:47]                     (requires messageflood module).
[19:49:07] <Quadpod88> hmm
[19:49:58] <ForestFox> Setting the channel mode is easier than scripting the bot to analyze msg/sec
[19:50:37] <Quadpod88> what about intense topics and debates
[19:50:49] <ForestFox> It works the same way
[19:51:06] <Quadpod88> my point
[19:51:40] <ForestFox> The only differences are, the server does it instead of the bot
[19:51:51] <ForestFox> And users can see the msg flood rate
[19:51:58] <ForestFox> That sets off the kick
[19:52:27] <Quadpod88> or ppl can just not do it
[19:54:02] * ForestFox shrugs
[19:54:41] <Quadpod88> and then there wouldn't be a need
[19:55:24] <Quadpod88> and there is censoring with the bot
[19:56:29] <Quadpod88> certain keywords have autokick
[19:57:19] <ForestFox> Again, unknown to everyone but the bot scripter
[19:57:44] <Quadpod88> well, they are kinda obvious
[19:57:53] <ForestFox> Unless you find out the hard way
[19:57:56] <Quadpod88> like the f* word
[19:58:45] <ForestFox> Ezel
[19:59:03] <ForestFox> So, it appears to be english
[19:59:26] <Quadpod88> yeah, it's english
[20:00:08] <Quadpod88> though if the ops figure it out, they could kick you
[20:04:38] * ForestFox shrugs
[20:09:08] <Quadpod88> so the hare and the fox, interesting pair we have
[20:11:42] <ForestFox> ?
[20:12:37] <Quadpod88> i'm the hare, you're the fox, it's cool

[21:35:29] <ronin> we to me Abraxas is an album by santana
[21:36:19] <ronin> can activity and exercise increase spiritual healing
[21:36:26] <ronin> or what can it be done in combination with
[21:36:32] <ronin> like of course yoga
[21:36:41] <ronin> mind-body-spirit
[21:37:23] <Quadpod88> well, excersise does improve mood, which improves spiritual health
[21:37:44] <ronin> i imagine when you dance a circle in a circle ritual
[21:37:57] <ronin> i'm seeing crows a lot
[21:38:04] <ronin> i feel like these guys are my spirit animal

[21:38:43] <Quadpod88> crows are quite intelligent
[21:38:57] <ronin> i feel like writing a story
[21:39:06] <ronin> like the one i can spy from my window here is looking for bread
[21:39:38] <Quadpod88> a hawk tried to teake my cat once
[21:39:44] <Quadpod88> take*
[21:39:45] <ronin> take?
[21:40:02] <Quadpod88> for dinner i suppose
[21:40:14] <ronin> that happened to someone i knew
[21:40:21] <ronin> was a kitten though :(
[21:40:43] <Quadpod88> well, the window stopped it
[21:41:25] <ronin> i think the videos i like to watch the most are crows

[22:11:18] <H-> hey
[22:11:36] <Quadpod88> hi h-
[22:12:34] <Hrafnbjorn> so, whats the topic today?
[22:12:56] <Quadpod88> don't have 1 yet
[22:13:19] <Quadpod88> you have 1?
[22:13:55] <Hrafnbjorn> not really... my brainn is a bit taxxed right now, lol
[22:14:17] <Quadpod88> mine 2
[22:14:28] <ronin> ah
[22:14:45] <Hrafnbjorn> was asked to write an article about berserk/ulfhednar, and some hypothetic ideas about their martial art(s)
[22:15:19] <Quadpod88> ?
[22:15:34] <Quadpod88> which is?
[22:15:56] <Quadpod88> berserkers?
[22:16:13] <Hrafnbjorn> which part berserk, ulfhednar, or the martial arts?
[22:16:48] <Quadpod88> yeah, could explain all
[22:17:29] <Hrafnbjorn> berserks and ulfhednar are roughly same thing... berserk is associated with bear, ulfhednar associated with wolf... berserk are front line shock troops, ulfhhednar are guerilla fighters
[22:18:05] <Quadpod88> i know there are theories that berserkers where high on shrooms, which ends my knowledge
[22:18:12] <Hrafnbjorn> both were religious cults, both had the battle frenzy associated with berserks... one wore bear skin, the other wolf skin
[22:18:32] <Quadpod88> oh
[22:18:40] <H-> Quadpod88: ever had mushrooms ? try fighting with that, you don't want to
[22:19:07] <Quadpod88> i said theories
[22:19:11] <H-> :D
[22:19:31] <Hrafnbjorn> well, we know they consumed amanita muscaria mushrooms, but not likely before combat... Nordics avoided intoxicants, even ale and mead before the fight
[22:19:38] <H-> for example the mushroom effect, it can make the ground bounce up and down while walking
[22:20:00] <H-> there goes your coordination
[22:20:03] <Hrafnbjorn> also upsets the stomach easily
[22:20:09] <H-> yeah
[22:20:18] <H-> bad trip for 4 hours.. not good
[22:20:22] * Quadpod88 dials the dea "tell me more"
[22:21:14] <Quadpod88> anyways
[22:22:24] <Hrafnbjorn> as for the marial arts... we can get an idea of how they moved in 2 ways.  One, by looking at traditional dance, hey did a lot of turningwhich is circular... also given that they were said to be immune to the bite of the blade, which implied a lot of circular motion... we can assume that t
[22:22:35] <Hrafnbjorn> assume they did a lot of circular turning
[22:22:58] <ronin> :(
[22:22:59] <Quadpod88> hmm
[22:23:18] <Quadpod88> like the scots?
[22:23:31] <Hrafnbjorn> I am just getting into the science behind some of it, so I cant comment on that too much yet
[22:23:43] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, much like the Pictish Scots
[22:24:06] <Quadpod88> nice
[22:25:32] <Hrafnbjorn> I still need to finish the research onn the science and psychology, but I ope it turns out to be a good article.  one back in early 90's, but only focused on the hypothetical martial artsI wrote a simiar
