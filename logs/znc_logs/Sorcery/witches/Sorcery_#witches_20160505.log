[02:46:33] <SpiritSong> wow you really are talented
[02:46:45] <Hrafnbjorn> the box is just a cheap one... $5 at Walmart, and originaly it had better shading, but when I stained it, most of the shading came off :(
[02:47:04] <SpiritSong> well it looks good as it, really
[02:47:12] <SpiritSong> i bet these would sell
[02:47:42] <Hrafnbjorn> perhaps

[02:48:03] <SpiritSong> yeeeees :D
[02:48:23] <Hrafnbjorn> I never know what fair price is, so I just wait til someone asks, and offers, lol
[02:49:19] <North> the sparseness of stain is pleasing to the eye
[02:49:43] <North> antique-ish

[04:31:28] <BansheeTears> He's just a snoring right along...
[04:32:22] <SpiritSong> awwww poor unsuspected fluffy cutie xD
[04:32:43] <BansheeTears> Yuppers
[04:33:01] <SpiritSong> hehe
[04:33:08] <BansheeTears> How was you walpurgis?
[04:33:20] <BansheeTears> And Beltane, and May Day
[04:33:25] <SpiritSong> walpurgis?
[04:33:42] <Hrafnbjorn> mine was good, took Sasha to the waterfalls and let her swim some of the flees off, lol
[04:33:53] <BansheeTears> Nice!
[04:34:24] <Hrafnbjorn> the flees are bad this year :(
[04:35:02] <BansheeTears> Wonder why it fluctuates...
[04:35:28] <BansheeTears> Have you ever tried lavender Castile soap.
[04:35:36] <BansheeTears> Or eucalyptus
[04:35:53] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, not yet, just been using cironela and catnip
[04:36:26] <BansheeTears> We used eucalyptus when the house got infested.. Helped a lot
[04:36:52] <BansheeTears> Also having a bowl of soapy water warm helps too
[04:36:54] <Hrafnbjorn> the catnip works well most of the time, we just got infested bad this year I think
[04:37:52] <BansheeTears> Used to smoke catnip and use it in tea.. Very soothing
[04:38:03] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed
[04:38:34] <BansheeTears> Do you grow it?
[04:38:48] <Hrafnbjorn> yep
[04:39:09] <BansheeTears> Does it tolerate your climate well?
[04:39:37] <Hrafnbjorn> as long as its in mostly shade, yeah
[04:39:38] <BansheeTears> Here it grows great till summer, then it's dehydrates right on the stem
[04:39:51] <BansheeTears> But the cats don't mind
[04:40:03] <Hrafnbjorn> I bet they dont, lol
[04:40:21] <BansheeTears> You ever tried catnip tea SpiritSong ?
[04:40:27] <BansheeTears> Lovely before bed
[04:40:43] <SpiritSong> nope, it sure sounds relaxing though ^_^
[04:40:50] <SpiritSong> im not a fan of tea though
[04:40:51] <BansheeTears> It really is
[04:41:16] <BansheeTears> If you can't sleep it's a good soothing drink
[04:41:17] <SpiritSong> i might give it a try. does it taste better than green tea?:P
[04:41:22] <BansheeTears> Very
[04:41:28] <SpiritSong> lol!!! good
[04:41:33] <Hrafnbjorn> a hippy friend of mine used to always mix catnip, skullcap, and California poppy petals for smoke mix, was pretty good, until ya got a bit with too much poppy, then it tasted kinda gross
[04:41:37] <BansheeTears> Green tea tastes astringent to me
[04:41:55] <BansheeTears> Yea the poppy is rough
[04:42:08] <SpiritSong> i might get some and try it, but no promises my cats wont steal it first. 
[04:42:31] <SpiritSong> Hrafnbjorn prolly a nice blend when done right
[04:42:48] <Hrafnbjorn> it is relaxing to say the least :)
[04:42:52] <BansheeTears> I mix catnip, passionflower and lemon balm for a tea
[04:43:02] <BansheeTears> Skullcap is pretty bitter

[04:48:27] <BansheeTears> Wise words north ;)
[04:48:33] <North> o/
[04:48:43] <Emily> I'm learning tarot and idk how many spreads there are
[04:48:49] <Keith> smartass in my eyes lol
[04:48:55] <BansheeTears> As many as are in you ur head
[04:48:56] <North> hey now
[04:48:59] <agent199> there are millions of spreads
[04:49:02] <BansheeTears> There's no limit
[04:49:10] <SpiritSong> many people make their own spreads
[04:49:24] <Keith> it is really using a spread that works for your style or taroting
[04:49:34] <Keith> or=of
[04:49:34] <BansheeTears> ^
[04:49:38] <BansheeTears> Yuppers
[04:49:40] <North> the Nutella one: highly recommended
[04:49:47] <MissSugar> when i taught tarot classes at the witchery at the end of it i would have my students create their own spreads
[04:49:47] * North makes an important contribution
[04:49:56] <Emily> I do the past present and future spread
[04:50:11] <MissSugar> i had one student create a tarot spread that was awesome, she called it the angel wing spread
[04:50:14] <BansheeTears> I like a nine card spread
[04:50:17] <MissSugar> i was really impressed
[04:50:31] <BansheeTears> Past present future, body mind spirit

[04:51:59] <MissSugar> :D
[04:52:16] <Emily> Covens sound scary to me
[04:52:33] <Keith> Emily... only join a coven if you think it is your thing..... see if maybe you can watch a few  sessions of them togegether
[04:52:33] <BansheeTears> Depends on the coven
[04:52:35] <Keith> together
[04:52:46] <North> <Hollywood>  "Whatever gave you that idea?"
[04:52:57] <BansheeTears> It's more like a extended family
[04:52:58] <Keith> Emily, BansheeTears is part of a coven and she enjoys it quite a bit
[04:53:09] <BansheeTears> Yup
[04:53:17] <MissSugar> LOL North
[04:53:18] <MissSugar> spot on
[04:53:31] <BansheeTears> The best coven members are also the best solitaries
[04:53:44] * North salutes with his glass of naturally carbonated spring water made with real lime flavour
[04:53:53] <SpiritSong> i wish there was a coven round here :P
[04:53:54] <Emily> I'm solitary...well I'm to young to be in a coven
[04:54:00] <Keith> how do you naturally carbonate water?
[04:54:04] <Emily> I'm only 16
[04:54:09] <SpiritSong> yeah most wont take you till you're 21
[04:54:09] <BansheeTears> One has to be comfortable flying solo too
[04:54:16] <MissSugar> only if you are wearing a fez 
[04:54:20] <Emily> My mom said 17
[04:54:22] <Emily> 18
[04:54:23] <BansheeTears> Lol!
[04:54:26] <Emily> I meant
[04:54:28] <Hrafnbjorn> Ive never been a part of a coven technicaly... been part of a couple organizations that held gatherings, but they werent coven
[04:54:31] <BansheeTears> Depends on the group
[04:54:33] <North> we may never know, Keiffer
[04:54:35] <SpiritSong> depends on the country and coven i guess
[04:54:48] <MissSugar> honestly a coven is just a group of people with like minded ideals 
[04:55:07] <Keith> North, it can't be possible.  I don't see scotty being able to give it all he's got anymore
[04:55:13] <BansheeTears> Who have a strong trust and good ability to work as a unit
[04:55:14] <North> lol
[04:55:23] <Hrafnbjorn> but I dont always play well with others, so solitary is good for me :)

[04:55:57] <MissSugar> welp
[04:56:29] <SpiritSong> some groups just end up worshipping certain members too...like the group near me lol
[04:56:38] <BansheeTears> I do most workings on my own, but celebrate sabbath and esbats with the coven
[04:56:50] <SpiritSong> but many are awesome
[04:56:52] <MissSugar> yeah finding a group that isnt all about the egos is hard
[04:56:58] <SpiritSong> yeah totally
[04:57:01] <BansheeTears> They can turn charismatic
[04:57:10] <BansheeTears> And groupie like

[04:57:59] <Keith> welcome back Emily
[04:58:00] <Emily> My mentor she gave up on me

[04:58:44] <BansheeTears> Your mentor and teacher will stick by ya when you find the right one
[04:59:00] <Emily> I been looking for a while
[04:59:05] <Emily> Since I started
[04:59:10] <Emily> 4 years ago
[04:59:11] <BansheeTears> Sometimes it takes years
[04:59:13] <Hrafnbjorn> thats the thing that bugged me about Dave, he thrived on his cult of personality (plus he talked down to everyone as if he was the only clergy, and as far as I know hes not even ordain4d anyway)
[04:59:36] <agent199> who is dave?
[04:59:47] <Hrafnbjorn> an ex-regular, agent199
[04:59:57] <agent199> are you talking about balith
[05:00:00] <BansheeTears> Same here .. I like him but he was too ego driven
[05:00:02] <Emily> He told me to hide wicca

[05:00:20] <North> that Dave guy....
[05:00:24] * North shakes his head, muttering
[05:00:24] <Hrafnbjorn> I will just leave it at 'Dave' since its not my goal to talk behind his back :)
[05:00:37] <agent199> no prob
[05:00:54] <BansheeTears> He's nice enough, but very by the book and treats the witches bible like its divine words
[05:01:02] <North> another 'High Priest' has been visiting the room recently
[05:01:16] <Hrafnbjorn> who, North?
[05:01:22] <BansheeTears> No one has a corner on wisdom and witchcraft.
[05:01:23] <North> WillowOak
[05:01:33] <Emily> I haven't really actuly talked to a high priest or high priestess
[05:01:37] <North> who wondered aloud if he should incorporate 'Lord' into his nick
[05:01:41] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, I must be missing him everytime then I guess
[05:01:53] <BansheeTears> Lol!!
[05:01:55] <agent199> ive seen him
[05:02:01] <BansheeTears> That's a warning sign
[05:02:06] <North> yep
[05:02:36] <BansheeTears> A good hp or hips doesn't advertise for fans
[05:02:43] <Hrafnbjorn> I think it depends on how it is incorporated... Freyr, Frey, Fro all mean 'lord' and are common as part of names
[05:02:43] <BansheeTears> Ups
[05:02:56] <BansheeTears> Hps
[05:03:04] <BansheeTears> Damn auto correct
[05:03:06] <Hrafnbjorn> I agree, BansheeTears
[05:03:33] <Hrafnbjorn> IMO, its irrelivent if you are clergy unless it is YOUR folk your speaking to
[05:03:43] <Keith> OKAY PEOPLE. ANYONE GOT SOME GOOD BOOK TITLES THAT FOR A SOLITARY WICCAN PERSON?
[05:03:47] <BansheeTears> And your talking to more than one hps

[05:04:09] <BansheeTears> Wicca for the solitary
[05:04:10] <Hrafnbjorn> when I was still part of Skergard they always added HG infront of their names on stuff, and it bugged me
[05:04:16] <BansheeTears> Green witchcraft
[05:04:21] <Hrafnbjorn> and caused much drama cause I refused to use it
[05:04:34] <North> Emily...elaborate, if you will
[05:04:43] <Hrafnbjorn> HG=Har Godhi (high priest)
[05:04:46] <Emily> I harmed myself many times
[05:04:58] <BansheeTears> I think adding it to your name is arrogant
[05:05:11] <BansheeTears> It presumes the teacher is done learning
[05:05:33] <Hrafnbjorn> to be honest, Emily, no living thing can avoid harming another living thing... IMO the important thing is to stay mindful, and respectful of the harm you do cause

[05:06:34] <Emily> My mom thinks I'm to young to do wicca
[05:07:29] <SpiritSong> would she be happy with your learning and not practicing till 17?
[05:07:36] <Emily> Cut myself north and starved trying to loose weight....emotionally break myself to bits.....letting a boy ruin me by listed ing to what he likes
[05:07:50] <BansheeTears> I here's where I stand on that... Study anything you want, but honor your mothers wishes while you live with her
[05:08:04] <SpiritSong> sorry to hear Emily :( do you have support with that?
[05:08:08] <Emily> Spiritsong idk she just told me whatever and she said she's finding me a coven
[05:08:11] <SpiritSong> ahreed BansheeTears
[05:08:21] <Emily> No
[05:08:30] <SpiritSong> she seems supportive
[05:08:31] <Emily> But I have breaked the habit a little
[05:08:44] <SpiritSong> well im glad you have
[05:08:45] <BansheeTears> Are you Ana?
[05:08:45] <Hrafnbjorn> there is good reason for parents to be weary of religious groups
[05:08:54] <BansheeTears> Truth Hrafnbjorn
[05:09:48] <Hrafnbjorn> not because they are all bad, of course, but religion does attract predators of all sorts
[05:09:59] <SpiritSong> yeah it does
[05:10:07] <BansheeTears> Many a predator has used a religious cloak
[05:10:18] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[05:10:33] <SpiritSong> fecking creeps
[05:10:38] <BansheeTears> Your mom pagan ?
[05:10:55] <MissSugar> you should really only join a group or coven when you are ready
[05:11:09] <BansheeTears> And does she know about your self harm and anorexia?
[05:11:12] <Emily> Yes she's pagan
[05:11:32] <Emily> She's raised me Christian and I choose wicca on my own
[05:11:44] <SpiritSong> same question as banshee
[05:11:49] <BansheeTears> Can you talk to her about spiritual things?
[05:11:57] <Emily> No
[05:12:05] <Emily> She won't let me

[20:40:46] <plantluvr> so what's a day in the life of a witch like yourself like?
[20:41:11] <H-> oh I'm not a witch to be honest
[20:41:18] <H-> I don't like the labels ;) I'm just me
