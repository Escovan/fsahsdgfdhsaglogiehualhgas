[00:07:33] <Abraxas> Welcome, OddlyGentle. Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.
[00:07:48] <Iona> welcome OddlyGentle

[00:09:02] *** Joins: Emanon (Nameless@sorcery-5nh10d.fios.verizon.net)
[00:09:03] <Abraxas> Welcome, Emanon. Enlightenment doesn't occur from sitting around visualizing images of light, but from integrating the darker aspects of the self into the conscious personality.
[00:10:50] <OddlyGentle> Many people think that using a fantasy language in magical work is either ignorant or an insult to "real practitioners". what do you all think about it?
[00:12:51] <Emanon> sounds like manufactured outrage
[00:12:59] <Iona> Isn't the development of all language a matter of someone fantasizing?
[00:14:08] <OddlyGentle> A very good point Iona
[00:14:43] *** Joins: Chiaro (Chiaro@sorcery-njk172.compassbank.com)
[00:14:44] <Abraxas> Welcome, Chiaro. There is no birth of consciousness without pain.
[00:15:13] <OddlyGentle> there are ancient and less developed languages that have no word for "wood" yet there is a word for "tree"
[00:16:03] <Iona> tree -> log -> wood...  all wood comes from trees, it's just the form of it that matters...
[00:17:11] <Iona> the thing is...  they understood that the form changes...  i.e. a stump is still part of a tree...
[00:17:25] <OddlyGentle> we have words like board, beam, and staff that older languages simply do not have
[00:17:43] <Iona> That being said...  it's also quite likely that those languages have different words for different roots...
[00:17:48] <Iona> and seeds...
[00:18:12] <Iona> like...  the difference between tree-roots and carrots and potatoes...
[00:18:43] <Iona> or of the difference between barley and wheat
[00:19:29] <OddlyGentle> so if there are tongues with words that others do not use, there must have been someone who came up with that word
[00:19:54] <Iona> yes.
[00:20:10] <OddlyGentle> therefore, I have no problem using constructed languages from fantasy universes in my work
[00:20:19] <OddlyGentle> or even making my own language
[00:20:31] * Iona smiles...
[00:20:54] <North> communication might be problematic
[00:21:11] <North> bit of a downside
[00:21:28] <Iona> I find sticking to simple words...  communicates better than dramatically whimsical verbiage...
[00:21:55] <North> I see what you did there, Pris
[00:22:30] <Iona> (it's serious, it's also seriously creative and taxing)
[00:22:42] <Iona> (both of which can be enjoyable)

[00:23:29] <OddlyGentle> I use numerology to take multiple words and boil them down to a new major symbol with its own much simpler name
[00:25:48] <Iona> example please?
[00:26:47] <PsychoMim> why is fish never good left over
[00:27:14] <North> because fishy
[00:27:20] <Iona> because bacteria
[00:27:22] * North provides a technical explanation
[00:27:35] <PsychoMim> it does taste more fishy
[00:27:37] <PsychoMim> and ew
[00:28:06] <North> garbage that thing, Q
[00:28:08] <Iona> Fish, especially commercially fished fish...  are not fresh at all coming off the ship...
[00:28:23] <Iona> they are frozen so they can bring in larger hauls.
[00:28:34] <PsychoMim> I'm quite accustomed to that

[00:35:53] <PsychoMim> you sound downish
[00:35:57] <PsychoMim> you ok?
[00:36:00] <Edward> Just finished vacuuming up the water in the basement.
[00:36:01] <OddlyGentle> several words substituted appropriately with others in a numerological set to create a compressed "magical" word
[00:36:03] <Edward> Im fine.
[00:36:11] <PsychoMim> oh dear
[00:36:16] <PsychoMim> that doesn't sound nice
[00:37:33] <Edward> So how about them sports

[00:40:44] <Edward> Im kinda bored
[00:40:59] <Edward> Kinda want to read, but kinda worn out from reading so much.
[00:41:57] <PsychoMim> doesn't seem possible, but okee
[00:42:11] <PsychoMim> I'm completely burned out on psych studies
[00:42:20] <Edward> What doesnt seem possible/
[00:42:33] <PsychoMim> to be warn out from reading 
[00:42:43] <PsychoMim> unless you're reading stuff you're forced to read
[00:43:14] <Iona> If you're not enjoying it, there's a thought that needs attention instead of suppression
[00:43:16] <Edward> Nein.
[00:43:43] <Edward> No matter if I enjoy it or not, if I read too much, I get worn out.
[00:43:52] * Edward shrugs
[00:43:54] <Iona> hmmm
[00:44:01] <Iona> eyestrain?  it's pretty common...
[00:44:09] <Edward> Maybe? 
[00:44:50] <OddlyGentle> "TO GAIN MONEY" = T G A I M Y = T G M = KYVA
[00:45:21] <Chiaro> I get worn out watching two or more cinemas, so why would reading be any different?
[00:46:37] <North> limits to attention
[00:46:40] <OddlyGentle> so "KHRA'DYN KYVA" means "This my will: to gain money"
[00:47:33] <OddlyGentle> that would be best used as something to aide in a job search or similar pursuit

[03:28:38] <DawnBatGuano> Kemetism is taking up most of it, the Taoism is pretty much just part of me at this point
[03:28:45] * Iona smiles...
[03:28:53] <Iona> Enjoy :)

[07:44:45] <ForestFox> Two really
[07:45:16] <MissSugar> okie dokie
[07:45:48] <ForestFox> What if severely depressed people are really highly sensitive empaths who dont know how to cope with it and it drains them to the point of unfeeling for long periods of time
[07:46:52] <Ravenna> back without a brb
[07:47:02] <MissSugar> yeah that is a good possibility 
[07:47:03] <Ravenna> And that's an interesting question, ForestFox
[07:47:41] <ForestFox> How would one try to fix this if its the case?
[07:47:54] <Ravenna> Anything is possible, in theory.
[07:48:45] <Ravenna> Well, I think it would be prudent to first rule out any medical causes
[07:48:57] <MissSugar> i suppose that would be an inner journey that you would have to go through in order to discover the true source of your pain
[07:50:33] <ForestFox> Hmm
[07:51:22] <Ravenna> Since it's not something traditional therapists are trained to help with, the person would pretty much have to help themselves

[17:26:38] <OddlyGentle> Why the fear of judgement?
[17:27:43] <Darkness> egocentric i sapose
[17:28:26] <OddlyGentle> I find that caring about what others think only hinders a positive self view
[17:29:13] <Darkness> don't we rely on other people to tell us what we are?
[17:31:48] <OddlyGentle> that is a poor quality of life
[17:32:29] <OddlyGentle> One must become self aware in order connect to one's inner power.
[17:32:48] <Darkness> i don't think it can be avioded
[17:33:32] <OddlyGentle> If you rely on others to tell you who you are, all you know a thousand opinions. This is not knowledge of self.
[17:34:22] <OddlyGentle> Wether or not you care what other people think is entirely your own choice just as it was left to them to choose what they think of you

[18:13:08] <OddlyGentle> Okay so this is a modified version of a spell for money that draws money to you by causing appreciation for the money you already have
[18:13:37] <Darkness> good qustion
[18:13:41] <OddlyGentle> it is easy enough for children to use it
[18:14:52] <Darkness> oddlygentle that statement is too esoteric from the energies that im invocing at this time
[18:15:22] <Amatha> respect is a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievement.
[18:15:50] <OddlyGentle> so you are looking for a more direct result rather than a pragmatic one?
[18:17:05] <Darkness> arent they the same thing?
[18:17:26] <Iona> okay, so with that definition, what can be cultivated, so that respect happens naturally, Darkness?

[18:19:23] <Iona> even if you're wrong, you're probably more "right" than you think - fear separates one from those who are "impressed"

[20:37:19] <DawnBatGuano> how do we explain the regal behaviour
[20:37:47] <Hrafnbjorn> it is just personality...
[20:38:03] <Iona> it's not just personality, but bone structure
[20:38:16] <Iona> Hrafnbjorn: regarding creating ones own model of doing magick...  I find it challenging (and worthwhile) to remove as many delusions as possible...  
[20:38:30] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed
[20:38:44] <DawnBatGuano> I say it's genetics. They were meant for it
[20:38:50] <Hrafnbjorn> I think, with regards to runes, the statement:
[20:38:58] <Iona> DawnBatGuano: correlation is not causation
[20:38:58] <Hrafnbjorn> knowest thou how to prove them?
[20:39:09] <Hrafnbjorn> implies getting through the delusion
[20:39:16] <Iona> By testing...  in as many environments as possible...?
[20:39:24] <Iona> By experiencing it...?
[20:39:54] <Hrafnbjorn> both
[20:40:29] <Hrafnbjorn> cats were/are meant as food around here... everything preys on them it seems
[20:41:08] <Iona> That's what I thought...
[20:41:20] <Hrafnbjorn> I think that the testing and experiment are intimatly connecdted
[20:41:35] <Iona> I agree...
[20:42:49] <Hrafnbjorn> 1 experience in 1 environmental condition does not show the big picture... only by experiencing the same but in relatioin to different conditions can we start to build a visualization of the bog picture (we can never visualize the whole big picture though)

[20:44:38] <Hrafnbjorn> kinda like how in science its not 'proven' until the experiment can be repeated with same result... except in the case of magic the result changes according to environ, but ya still need the repeated test to be able to predict (as well as possible) how a goven effort will manifest

[20:45:42] <Hrafnbjorn> I can use the galdr for fe/fehu in one condition, and it may break through barriers,... yet in another condition it might create barriers.  If my goal is to break them down, but I dont have experience with enough conditions I may actualy increase barriers

[20:52:16] <Hrafnbjorn> its the folk that cannot allow convo that doesnt revolve around them, or in the case of one person he snaps at folk for having convo that is over his head
[20:52:18] <Iona> Thank you for letting me know
[20:54:37] <Hrafnbjorn> DawnBat frustrates me a lot.... he is a good guy, and I dont dislike him, he just tries to make all convo about him, or what he is doing.  Even if there is a topic that has nothing to do with what he is doing, he tries to find ways of herding folk to speak about his games, or his frustrations, or his gayness, etc... none of which are 'bad,' just not on point with the rooms point

[21:12:07] <Hrafnbjorn> my drive way is actualy a good huntin zone, lol.  I have lots of red with white marbling, and green with black marbling... dunno what kind of stone they are though

[21:18:44] <Iona> Maybe you're not the only one who is having difficulties with the paper?
[21:18:53] <PsychoMim> Hypothetical case study illustrating a couple‚Äôs need for divorce counselling 
[21:18:55] <PsychoMim>     Bob and Terri have been married for 5 years and have 2 children. Terri is 10 years younger than Bob and still in her early 20s. She is tired of being tied to her family life and wants to have fun and doesn't see a life with Bob anymore. They go to counselling initially to repair their marriage. The counselor asks both Bob and Terri if they're prepared to work out their differences, but Terri says she isn't. As much of a shock as it is to Bob, 
[21:18:55] <PsychoMim> Terri with the help of their counselor begins to  understand. The counselor begins a new set of strategies to help them consider their losses. Bob and Terri are legally divorced within four months. 
[21:19:26] <PsychoMim> I'm not, but this is where they weed out the weak ones!!!! I'm stressin' 
[21:19:44] * North hugs
[21:19:55] <North> I hate that for you
[21:20:15] <Iona> That's the narrative...  what do you perceive?
[21:20:28] <PsychoMim> I had to write that narrative
[21:20:30] <North> go get effed, Bob & Terri
[21:20:38] <PsychoMim> I have to write all of the narratives
[21:20:42] * North gives Bob &Terri the whatfor
[21:20:56] <Iona> So how does the counsellor help?  
[21:21:22] <PsychoMim> oh, they have to facilitate the seperation to minimze the impact of loss
[21:21:25] <Iona> Is it through say...  roleplay?  where Terri is able to act out roles which please her more?
[21:21:38] <PsychoMim> they make us stipulate that before we write the narrative
[21:21:41] <Iona> Hmmm.  Focusing on the separation...  
[21:22:05] <PsychoMim> the narrative is an example of what makes them go to counselling 
[21:22:08] <Iona> Lawyers have a saying... "if everyone is equally unhappy, it's probably the right choice"...  but that still puts the focus on the negatives...
[21:22:19] <North> Bob & Terri would survive without that counselor, I'm thinking
[21:22:39] <PsychoMim> North, they usually do
[21:22:41] <Iona> What are the positives, of Terri staying in the relationship?  of Terri exploring new experiences?  of Bob joining in on that?
[21:22:50] <PsychoMim> it's not about that
[21:22:56] <PsychoMim> it's about divorce counselling
[21:23:16] <PsychoMim> you see there are many different kinds of marriage counselling
[21:23:22] <Iona> Also, what boundaries exist between Bob and Terri?  was there a prenup?

[21:30:25] <Iona> PsychoMim: sometimes working with statistica stereotypes helps
[21:30:31] <Iona> *statistical
[21:30:51] <PsychoMim> Iona, that's brilliant
[21:30:53] <Iona> Also, PsychoMim, this may help?  http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/why-marriage-counseling-leads-to-divorce-wcz/
[21:31:30] <Iona> for example, Mim, the stereotype of a Mexican couple who are divorcing has a different context from say...  a next-gen-hippie couple..
[21:32:07] <Iona> (the next-gen-hippies may be dealing with jealousy, where the Mexican couple could be dealing with domestic violence)

[21:34:30] <PsychoMim> I'm more going toward West Indian culture which deals with the same issues. Thank you for your help, Iona
[21:35:02] <PsychoMim> that's an interesting article...a lot of is does seem to be person-centered methodology 
[21:35:13] <North> <Professor>  "Your paper appears to be nothing more than a printed out selfie of you giving the finger."   <Q>  ...    <Professor>  "I'm afraid that you're going to have to settle for a B+, Ms. Borogove."   <Q>  ?   <Professor>  "Because no footnotes."   <Q>  :D
[21:35:30] <Iona> West Native American?
[21:35:42] <PsychoMim> but there are other approaches that can be used in situations of divorce or couples counselling where there's violence
[21:35:45] <PsychoMim> no
[21:35:47] <PsychoMim> West Indian
[21:35:53] <Iona> Ok
[21:36:05] <Iona> So what are the stereotypes, and what do you know of them?

[21:36:07] <Abraxas> Welcome, DawnBatGuano. I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.
[21:36:32] <DawnBatGuano> I bring guano with love :)
[21:37:11] <PsychoMim> I used the west indian couple in the premarital section 
[21:37:18] <DawnBatGuano> hey PsychoMim :D
[21:37:20] <Iona> welcome DawnBatGuano.  Ok Mim :)
[21:37:25] <PsychoMim> hey DawnBatGuano
[21:37:32] <DawnBatGuano> :D
[21:37:40] <PsychoMim> also psychology professors don't like to get into stereo typing
[21:37:46] <PsychoMim> infact it's largely frowned upon 
[21:38:01] <DawnBatGuano> :(
[21:38:18] <PsychoMim> it's a fine line we walk 
[21:38:20] <PsychoMim> so fine 
[21:38:28] <Iona> Agreed...  and you're creating a fiction...  
[21:38:31] <PsychoMim> also North, I'd love to do that with maybe some ASCII script!
[21:38:42] <North> ;)
[21:38:46] <DawnBatGuano> what did I walk into
[21:39:10] <Iona> a psychology essay problem, I think.
[21:39:28] <PsychoMim> it's not really a problem, more of a PITA
[21:39:36] <DawnBatGuano> mmm psychology
[21:40:01] <PsychoMim> especially since I'm biased towards divorce according to the article above (which is true)
[21:40:02] <PsychoMim> lol
[21:40:22] <PsychoMim> I have an amazing marriage tho
[21:40:59] <PsychoMim> I feel like you either believe in your coupledom or you don't and once you have to bring in a neutral party to help you decipher that, DOOOOOOOOOOOOOM 
[21:40:59] <DawnBatGuano> :D
[21:41:05] <DawnBatGuano> I have an unofficial husband
[21:41:10] <PsychoMim> that's my opinion, obviously, not a fact. 
[21:41:41] <PsychoMim> how do you define unofficial husband
[21:41:51] <PsychoMim> you're not legally binded in marriage
[21:42:02] <Iona> fiancee?
[21:42:13] <Iona> Agreed Mim
[21:42:14] <DawnBatGuano> Pretty much
[21:42:20] <DawnBatGuano> We're working it out though
[21:42:30] <Iona> ... and sometimes it's the hard questions which can get people to think about why they believe/dont believe...
[21:42:32] <PsychoMim> so, why don't you call him fiance then
[21:42:46] <DawnBatGuano> it'd probably affect our incomeif we got officially married
[21:43:03] <PsychoMim> wouldn't "partner" suffice?
[21:43:12] <DawnBatGuano> True
[21:43:17] <DawnBatGuano> I usually use that.
[21:43:23] <PsychoMim> ah, gotcha
[21:43:24] <DawnBatGuano> I like the sound of husband :P
[21:43:35] <DawnBatGuano> I want to do a hybrid-wedding sometime
[21:43:46] <PsychoMim> sounds like your wants aren't being met already...
[21:44:01] <DawnBatGuano> Hm?
[21:44:36] <Iona> For example, a question (newly) asked to young kids having *** is:  If someone always asked for you to get a cup of water...  why should you say yes?  When is the reciprocation?  (it goes both ways - all one way and not another is not working)
[21:44:39] <H-> wasn't that obvious ? :p
[21:44:40] <Hrafnbjorn> what is a hybrid-wedding??
[21:45:00] <DawnBatGuano> Possibly Pagan-Islam
[21:45:13] <H-> pagan islam :o)
[21:45:27] <Iona> *** that is without reciprocation is like someone asking for water and rarely (if ever) giving...
[21:45:32] <PsychoMim> better make sure that's what he wants :) 
[21:45:36] <Hrafnbjorn> not really such thing as a pagan wedding... marriage wasnt a religious thing until recently
[21:45:41] <DawnBatGuano> i want it but, well.
[21:45:52] <PsychoMim> but he doesn't?
[21:45:53] <DawnBatGuano> Not sure what he wants to do really.
[21:46:02] <H-> only one way to find out
[21:46:10] <Hrafnbjorn> what is the 'pagan' version to you?
[21:46:15] <DawnBatGuano> Handfasting
[21:47:06] <Hrafnbjorn> so, central Euro, Brittish, and Irish?
[21:47:18] <DawnBatGuano> anywho, we still neeed to work on the whole living situation
[21:47:20] <Hrafnbjorn> *pre-Germanic Brittish
[21:48:49] <PsychoMim> he doesn't live in your area does he
[21:48:54] <DawnBatGuano> since we're both on disability, it might be hard to move in
[21:49:24] <PsychoMim> How old is handfasting?
[21:49:31] <PsychoMim> did they do that back in the day?
[21:49:38] <DawnBatGuano> I'm not exactly sure
[21:49:44] <DawnBatGuano> it'd mean a lot to me
[21:50:14] <DawnBatGuano> considering that I not only have Celtic and Germanic blood
[21:50:19] <Hrafnbjorn> it depends on how ya refer to it... handfasting is a ritual in which a rope is either tied to both, or wrapped over hands... it goes back pre history.  There is of course the modern term used by Neo-
[21:50:28] <Hrafnbjorn> *Neo-Paganism
[21:50:49] <DawnBatGuano> I'd be interested in finding out about Kemetic weddings
[21:50:50] <PsychoMim> ah ok, so you're saying the actually term isn't new?
[21:51:21] <Hrafnbjorn> no, the term could also be written hand-fastening
[21:51:31] <PsychoMim> ok
[21:52:13] <DawnBatGuano> "Particularly during the early periods of ancient Egypt, the future husband made a payment to the bride's father, usually amounting to about the cost of a slave. "
[21:52:27] <Hrafnbjorn> but, as language changed, the words changed too, so go back to Old English, it may have been hond-tiegen
[21:52:58] * DawnBatGuano eats brownies in sorrow
[21:53:16] <Hrafnbjorn> or I think fasten was 'lucan' but dont remember for sure
[21:53:33] <PsychoMim> interesting
[21:53:45] <PsychoMim> where is your "fiance" DawnBatGuano
[21:53:54] <DawnBatGuano> He lives on the other side of town
[21:54:12] <PsychoMim> how much time do you spend together
