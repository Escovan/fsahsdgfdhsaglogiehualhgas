[00:00:05] <Fireeternal> sorry...you were probably talking about something else
[00:00:08] <MissSugar> yes they do 
[00:00:15] <DawnBat> oh dang
[00:00:25] <DawnBat> used to spirits being shapeshiftey
[00:00:31] <MissSugar> not in voodoo
[00:00:52] <DawnBat> Now odd question, are there any vampiric entities?
[00:01:00] <Fireeternal> i think so....
[00:01:02] <MissSugar> yes
[00:01:03] * Jack_Curious waddles to the corner, and plops down to read some Machiavelli
[00:01:07] <DawnBat> Aight
[00:01:07] <MissSugar> the boo hag
[00:01:13] <DawnBat> Oh yes her...orhim?
[00:01:15] <Jack_Curious> >vampiric energies.
[00:01:19] <DawnBat> or him/her?
[00:01:19] * Neymei plots some apricot muffins and listens.
[00:01:23] <Jack_Curious> Entities*
[00:01:36] <MissSugar> remember the witch that strips off her skin at night and sits on mens chests and sucks out their life force
[00:01:38] <MissSugar> fun times
[00:01:44] <DawnBat> ah yes
[00:01:48] <Jack_Curious> An entity can only take what you give it access to
[00:01:55] <DawnBat> Not really Jack_Curious
[00:01:59] <DawnBat> it depends on the culture
[00:02:01] <Fireeternal> i think i have a vampiric entity that hangs around me
[00:02:20] <Maily> To kill voodoo vampires you just make a doll of them and stick needles in it tho
[00:02:24] <Neymei> I'm fearful enough of dabbling with darker entities that I could think I'm not giving them access and actually be out of fear, I think. Maybe. I dunno!
[00:02:38] <MissSugar> acrtually
[00:02:41] <MissSugar> *actually
[00:02:44] <MissSugar> all you need is a fern
[00:02:49] <Jack_Curious> No. It doesn't. That's like saying if rape is culturally normal then it's not degenerate.
[00:02:56] <Jack_Curious> it still is
[00:03:08] <Fireeternal> it speaks to me often
[00:03:16] <DawnBat> MissSugar: I asked cause Voodoo has traces left from Africa yes
[00:03:41] <Jack_Curious> If you put up walls to block entities, they can't take anything. Its all down to you
[00:03:42] <MissSugar> yeah
[00:04:01] <Fireeternal> gtg tyll
[00:04:03] <DawnBat> only one I remember is a highly nasty South African vampire called Tikoloshe

[00:04:13] <Neymei> No, I'm not saying that, Jack. I'm saying that for me, personally, just me, it's about conviction and total strength of will. And I'm afraid my fear would be my undoing.
[00:04:46] <DawnBat> Also!
[00:04:47] <MissSugar> oh yeah there are a lot of entities that didnt make it over the boat ride
[00:04:54] <DawnBat> I wanna become like John Coffey
[00:05:01] <DawnBat> a healer
[00:05:01] <Jack_Curious> Neymei. That's my point, your fear gives access to the parts you're vunerable in
[00:05:05] <MissSugar> oh
[00:05:15] <Jack_Curious> that's nothing to do with culture
[00:05:18] <DawnBat> like in theory you can do reverse reiki or such
[00:05:25] <Neymei> I never said anything about it having to do with culture.
[00:05:29] <DawnBat> suck out the sick energy or such
[00:05:36] <MissSugar> cool
[00:05:38] <Neymei> Your point IS my point. lol
[00:05:55] <DawnBat> I have my Mary Poppins Bag today!
[00:06:07] <DawnBat> muh Bag O Wonders
[00:06:29] <Jack_Curious> Oh kk
[00:07:00] <Neymei> That's why I don't dabble, personally. Still too afraid. It'd keep doors unlocked I want closed, I think. :)
[00:07:01] <Maily> Does ur bag have candy n stuff in it dawn bat
[00:07:12] <DawnBat> nah 
[00:07:17] <DawnBat> just mystical stuff
[00:07:38] <DawnBat> I'm like the Metaphysical version of Mary Poppins, my drag name is modelled after her
[00:07:44] <Maily> Aw. Candy is mystical tho right?
[00:07:51] <DawnBat> depends...
[00:08:04] <DawnBat> Does it have zombie dust? Or does it have absinthe?
[00:08:17] <DawnBat> MissSugar should make Zombie Candy
[00:08:40] <MissSugar> i should make zombies
[00:08:54] <MissSugar> if only they werent so much work and maintenance 
[00:09:04] <DawnBat> like 50 years you could be this sweet old lady and like "you wanna candy?"
[00:09:08] <DawnBat> They eat it and BAM! zombified
[00:09:18] <Maily> Should have invented the iPhone. Instant zombie appocolypse
[00:09:23] <MissSugar> i wish it was that simple
[00:09:27] <Neymei> brb
[00:09:40] <DawnBat> well couldn't you mix the zombie such with homemade candy?
[00:09:50] <Maily> They lurch up to the store every new release in hordes...
[00:10:44] <DawnBat> I suggested laxative but that'd probably just flush the zombie potion out
[00:10:49] <Maily> *yawns* I feel like a nap
[00:10:59] <DawnBat> like zombies with diarrhea?
[00:11:04] <DawnBat> Yaassss gurll

[00:12:52] <DawnBat> the whole insanity and mindlessness right?
[00:12:55] <Maily> Irl zombies have no brains nor the intention to get one?
[00:13:45] <MissSugar> more like heavy drug, brainwash, heavy drug, brainwash
[00:13:59] <DawnBat> so it's forceful reconditioning?
[00:14:23] <MissSugar> uh yeah
[00:14:27] <DawnBat> Well candy could still work right? Just give them more
[00:14:33] <DawnBat> and who doesn't like candy!
[00:14:52] <MissSugar> its the brainwash part
[00:15:00] <MissSugar> where you have to convince them that they are dead
[00:15:03] <DawnBat> oh
[00:15:06] <DawnBat> spooky
[00:15:27] <DawnBat> If I was any of MissSugar's exes, I'd be terrified

[00:45:14] <Jack_Curious> Crap list.....Wow, so I have a differing opinion than yours and suddenly I'm like a lesser being? You're literally a Christian if that's how you treat people.
[00:45:25] <DawnBat> nah
[00:45:50] <DawnBat> You're there cause YOU said somethig I believe in heavily is bull
[00:45:57] * SpiritSong watches chat....
[00:46:24] *** Guest43494 is now known as Rajoguna
[00:46:26] <MissSugar> Dawn just put him on ignore
[00:46:32] <DawnBat> probably will in a bit
[00:46:36] <SpiritSong> is this really worth fighting over....
[00:46:47] <SpiritSong> if ye dont get along, ignore each others butts
[00:46:57] <DawnBat> truth SpiritSong
[00:47:14] <DawnBat> I just always thought this was a place of acceptance and non-swearing-y languages
[00:47:17] <Neymei> Everyone is entitled to their opinions. :) I don't think any of us actually know 100% what's real and what's not. <3
[00:47:49] <Jack_Curious> You know how you can tell most past life crap is fake? There's always an ego behind it. You're never just a normal person. Always royalty or some crap. And don't get butthurt at me for stating a fact. Science has proved it. Too many people don't get that science and occultism can coincide. People take it to extremes to often.
[00:47:50] <DawnBat> MissSugar: Wait we have Madame MArie's tomb locale
[00:47:58] <MissSugar> maybe
[00:48:06] <MissSugar> they actually dont know where she was buried
[00:48:15] <DawnBat> Ah
[00:48:35] <DawnBat> well I mean. If they had liek grave dirt from her (if it's legal), wouldn't that cost a fortune
[00:49:15] <DawnBat> and SpiritSong, do you have any good online stores for me?
[00:49:15] <MissSugar> they use to leave 3 X marks for a prayer to Marie
[00:49:31] <MissSugar> then some dumb ass painted the tomb pink
[00:49:39] <DawnBat> dang
[00:49:46] <MissSugar> using a latex paint on an antique tomb
[00:49:48] <SpiritSong> not in the usa DawnBat
[00:49:52] <DawnBat> she's probably rolling around 
[00:49:56] <Jack_Curious> And fyi. Just because you heavily believe in it, doesn't instantly make it true. Xitans heavily believe gay people will go to Hell, does that make it anymore true? No. And with that I'm done. Imma go read
[00:49:57] <MissSugar> it cost a fortune to remove
[00:50:08] <MissSugar> sooo
[00:50:11] <DawnBat> SpiritSong: Don't matter, just window shopping
[00:50:24] <DawnBat> Well here's one
[00:50:41] <DawnBat> If it WAS her tomb. The vandals would have met with some MASSIVe unfortunate ending
[00:50:44] <DawnBat> amirite?
[00:50:45] <MissSugar> sallie anne glassman raised the funds to open a spiritual center where they put a large altar to marie laveau where people could pray to her with out damaging the tombs
[00:51:32] *** Quits: Neymei (FullMoonMag@sorcery-jiod5f.co.comcast.net) (Quit: )
[00:51:55] <DawnBat> I imagine that with how popular and famous Marie is (I think) that she'd probably have a big influence here still 
[00:52:08] <MissSugar> not every spirit is going to want to work with you
[00:52:12] <DawnBat> true
[00:52:15] <MissSugar> no matter how much you like them
[00:52:27] <MissSugar> its easiest to light a candle to them and wait for an answer
[00:52:32] <DawnBat> what I meant is though like someone vandalized her true resting spot she coulda smote them right
[00:52:47] <MissSugar> she probably did in her own way
[00:52:54] <MissSugar> nobody ever found out who did that
[00:53:00] <DawnBat> ahhh yea
[00:54:11] <DawnBat> tfw you looking at guys who are on fleek and eating cookies
[00:54:59] <DawnBat> i feel so low

[00:58:12] <Keith> i am going to start doing my tea sugar free
[00:58:17] <MissSugar> or use honey
[00:58:32] <DawnBat> nah that'd be cannibalism cause Keith is a honey
[00:58:33] <MissSugar> i cant say anything because i am an addict too
[00:58:34] <Keith> honey is expensive, and i find it doesn't do much for me
[00:58:40] <MissSugar> everything has sugar in it

[06:28:05] <Escovan> :<
[06:28:26] <Escovan> IÂ´m just trying to figure out your age. I donÂ´t mean bad.
[06:28:28] <MissSugar> so in retort not to be insulting but ............... cram that with walnuts

[06:42:35] <MissSugar> SPIRITUAL BATH FTW!
[06:43:31] <TheAllison> The community is great, full of amazing people... It wasn't a bad experience until I stood on the 'wrong' side.
[06:43:53] <TheAllison> Wrong side being not Newfs side -_-
[06:44:18] <TheAllison> But that's history now, in tha dustsies xD
[06:44:21] <TheAllison> Bbl

[06:47:27] <SpiritSong> its a good article too
[06:47:52] <TheAllison> Thanks, I appreciate it, but over a decade with the craft... I have a bath ritual I dearly love
[06:48:03] <MissSugar> spiritual bathing is so darn effective

[06:51:41] <MissSugar> hmmm decisions decisions

[06:52:14] <SpiritSong> im curious about that one

[06:52:33] <MissSugar> i knew it! your secretly evil
[06:52:37] <SpiritSong> duh
[06:52:39] <SpiritSong> :P
[06:52:56] <MissSugar> oh yeah
[06:53:03] <MissSugar> i suppose thats not much a revelation 
[06:53:05] <SpiritSong> but maybe start with the soap. we dont want to encourage the thievery of teeth lololol
[06:53:21] <SpiritSong> xD
[06:53:44] <MissSugar> i wonder if i went to the dentist and asked for their bucket of teeth if they would give it to me
[06:54:04] <SpiritSong> but you wouldnt even know who you were cursing
[06:54:16] <MissSugar> i could dry them out since they are bones and use them to make a spirit bottle
[06:54:34] <SpiritSong> well this is true

[07:13:38] <Escovan> And if I could choose: LetÂ´s stick with living for a while ... IÂ´ll get there eventually.
[07:14:11] <MissSugar> good choice
[07:14:25] <Keith>  I would choose death... but that is just me.

[11:22:34] <Keith> shifts
[11:22:41] <raevynskyyemt> it's a small hotel

[11:23:20] * Keith does research
[11:23:52] <raevynskyyemt> i work from 2 to 2

[11:25:41] <raevynskyyemt> i don't have to haul my roku, xbox, and computer over
[11:25:53] <Keith> interesting
[11:26:06] <raevynskyyemt> billings is usually an overnight, if not 3 day, trip
[11:26:08] <Keith> probably saves you money on rent
[11:26:20] <raevynskyyemt> it does

[11:27:00] <raevynskyyemt> i also get free cable and wifi
[11:27:09] <raevynskyyemt> well, got free cable
[11:27:17] <Keith> gotchas
[11:27:18] <raevynskyyemt> the cable/phone/internet company is dropping cable service
[11:27:36] <Keith> that sucks
[11:27:52] <raevynskyyemt> bonus is they're talking about installing fiber optic internet
[11:28:05] <Keith> that would rock
[11:29:08] <raevynskyyemt> except for cbs, syfy, and usa i watch my tv online. so it's not a loss for me
[11:29:27] <Keith> i see.
[11:29:31] <raevynskyyemt> however, if we get amc back with sattelite tv i might cancel sling
[11:30:01] <Keith> never heard of this sling
[11:30:13] <raevynskyyemt> it's a service that provides tv channels online
[11:30:33] <Keith> is it free?
[11:30:36] <raevynskyyemt> no
[11:30:44] <Keith> that sucks
[11:30:47] <raevynskyyemt> it's actually kind of expensive. but i need my amc
[11:31:08] <Keith> for which show?
[11:34:21] <raevynskyyemt> walking dead. fear the walking dead. turn. talking dead (a talk show about walking dead and fear the walking dead).
[11:34:32] <Keith> oh.
[11:34:34] <raevynskyyemt> and there's a new one soon called preacher. seems to be about a possessed priest
[11:34:55] <raevynskyyemt> better caul saul is popular as well, but i've never seen it
[11:35:10] <Keith> that is what torrents are for
[11:35:11] <raevynskyyemt> https://www.sling.com/
[11:35:42] <raevynskyyemt> true, Keith
[11:35:56] * Keith nods sagely
[11:36:13] <Keith> i simply wait for the season to be done, then binge lol
[11:36:41] <raevynskyyemt> yeah. but walking dead spoils almost as fast as game of thrones
[11:37:04] <Keith> i went through all of season 5 of GoT without spoilers.
[11:37:11] <raevynskyyemt> i read the books
[11:37:14] <Keith> i got lucky
[11:37:25] <raevynskyyemt> but now part of the tv show has gone past the books while other parts are behind
[11:37:26] <Keith> i'm not a big reading type guy
[11:37:32] <raevynskyyemt> those are big books
[11:37:38] <raevynskyyemt> which is why i use audio books
[11:37:42] <raevynskyyemt> i can listen while playing a game
[11:37:43] <Keith> makes sense
[11:37:46] <raevynskyyemt> or working
[11:37:49] <Keith> which games?
[11:38:17] <Keith> do you pow on WoW?
[11:38:20] <raevynskyyemt> right now i'm on my 5th playthrough of fallout 4

[11:45:09] * Keith is very confused
[11:45:29] <raevynskyyemt> i'm not sure i ever said exactly where in montana i live
[11:45:49] <Keith> oh....... lol.  i thought you said it was one time
[11:46:01] <Keith> mwah bad
[11:46:09] <raevynskyyemt> sometimes i am nonsensical
[11:46:13] <raevynskyyemt> maybe i was sleep chatting
[11:46:18] <Keith> quite possibly
[11:47:49] <Keith> worden?
[11:48:23] <raevynskyyemt> ?
[11:48:52] <Keith> lol was almost gonna start naming random towns
[11:49:06] <raevynskyyemt> there are several hundred in monana
[11:49:14] <raevynskyyemt> you might guess right eventually
[11:49:17] <Keith> yup.... but you kinda gave some clues
[11:50:05] <Keith> oh well
[11:50:31] <raevynskyyemt> i could look up towns in alberta and start guessing, too :p
[11:50:43] <Keith> lol or you could just ask
[11:50:52] <raevynskyyemt> that, too
[11:50:56] <Keith> yup
[11:52:02] <raevynskyyemt> so who's your adopted team for the playoffs?
[11:52:09] <raevynskyyemt> or did your team make it?
[11:52:32] <Keith> actually... i am one of the few canadians who doesn't care about hockey that much
[11:52:49] <raevynskyyemt> ah. oh well
[11:52:55] <Keith> yup
[11:52:58] <Keith> who is left?
[11:55:52] <raevynskyyemt> stars are playing the blues, sharks are playing the predators. lightning are playing the islanders. capitals are  playing the penguins
[11:56:12] <raevynskyyemt> and i have to adopt a second team. my adopted team, who i thought was going to win again this year, lost
[11:56:16] <Keith> might as well go "patriotic" and go for the capitals
[11:56:43] <raevynskyyemt> can't think of a better reason
[11:57:01] <Keith> well I aint even US.... only kinda sorta part US lol
[11:58:16] <raevynskyyemt> dc isn't part of the us either. it's sort of in limbo
[11:58:40] <Keith> yeah... i never understood the disctrict of columbia bit
[11:59:06] <raevynskyyemt> congress, as a whole, represents them. instead of giving them a territory status or their own congressinal represenatives
[11:59:10] <raevynskyyemt> it's....weird
[11:59:30] <Keith> weird
[11:59:46] <raevynskyyemt> and they still have to pay taxes. which is debatably unconstitutional
[12:00:06] <Keith> weird
[12:01:08] * Keith ponders bed
[12:01:21] <raevynskyyemt> i can listen to podcasts if you're getting sleepy

[16:21:36] <Jack_Curious> I may, one day xD
