[06:29:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yup, Widds and her hy=ubby did a great job.

[06:30:13] <Hrafnbjorn> I like it too... it is refreshing, if that makes sense
[06:30:27] <Ravenna> It makes sense. I was thinking of the same thing
[06:30:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The horoscope section needs some tweaking, but otherwise, it's great.
[06:31:33] <Ravenna> Hrafnbjorn: you got my attention with the words "runic dream".  I would like to hear more if you are willing to share
[06:32:17] <Hrafnbjorn> I made 2 groups there, one for runic studies, the other for seidhr.  Someone made an empty post in the Heathen forum for runes, but it should in all honesty be kept a bit seperate from the Heathen topic since they were more popular during the Christian period, so they are not purely Heathen (just Heathen at foundation)
[06:32:22] <Hrafnbjorn> sure
[06:32:39] <Hrafnbjorn> I was thinking about the Vanic god Freyr
[06:33:07] <Hrafnbjorn> and fell asleep, and had dream about him, and how runes connect to him
[06:33:31] <Hrafnbjorn> in the Elder row, and the Saxon row, there is a rune specific to him (ing)
[06:33:44] <Hrafnbjorn> however, ing doesnt exist in the younger row
[06:34:00] <Hrafnbjorn> but there is an alternate 'a' stave called ar
[06:34:19] <Hrafnbjorn> ar, most often is seen as similar to jera from the elder row
[06:34:40] <Hrafnbjorn> which is not untrue, as ar translates to 'good harvest'
[06:35:15] <Keith> i hate minor tears in muscles
[06:35:29] <Hrafnbjorn> the attributes to the anthropomorphed Freyr are fridhr (peace) and ar (good harvest)
[06:36:06] <raevynskkyyemt>  We all do Keith 
[06:36:33] <Keith> that is quite the dream Hrafnbjorn
[06:36:47] * Keith nods to raevynskkyyemt
[06:36:51] <Hrafnbjorn> The Ynglinga kings of Sweden trace ancestry to Freyr, and there was a period, mentioned in Ynglinga Saga in which Freyr was the 3rd king, and a period called "Peace of Frodhi" was worldwide
[06:37:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Oh, Sapphyre was in looking for you earlier, Hrafnbjorn
[06:37:23] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, havnt seen her in long time, wonder what she wanted
[06:37:49] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> She was saying she liked discussing the Norse stuff with you
[06:37:58] <Hrafnbjorn> ah, ok
[06:40:45] <Hrafnbjorn> so, yeah, that was my dream... an exploration of Freyr's lore, and its relation to the runes... probably doesnt sound too interesting, but it made me feel recharged and inspired :)
[06:41:42] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It actually DOES sound intereesting
[06:42:18] <Ravenna> Hrafnbjorn: It sounds interesting to me. You see, it figures into my insight into Freyr's lore and role and his relation to runes
[06:42:23] <Hrafnbjorn> made me want to write about him. so here in a couple days, I should have a post about him up on the site :)
[06:42:33] <raevynskkyyemt> Cool
[06:43:51] <Hrafnbjorn> Ravenna, if you like Freyr, or have interes in him, there is a wonderful, and very short book written by Anne Groa Sheffield named "Frey: God of the World" you might enjoy
[06:43:59] <Hrafnbjorn> *interest
[06:44:03] <Ravenna> peace can be only be bought and maintained via strength, and good harvest is also a symbol of strength and relates to masculine virility and seed in a way. So Freyr represents to me not just peace and good harvest (abundance) but also the strength that makes peace possible
[06:45:14] <Ravenna> and the strong masculine principle that participates with the strong feminine principle to  make the good harvest possible
[06:45:18] <Ravenna> If that makes sense
[06:45:24] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed.  When you take the Germanic concept of fertility (something often associated with all the Vanic deities) as being an extenssion of hamingja (luck) it really starts to fit his overall lore
[06:45:28] <Ravenna> It's super late here and I am tired so I am not at my best with words atm
[06:45:51] <Hrafnbjorn> you are making perfect sense :)
[06:46:03] <Ravenna> Okay, I was worried there for a minute
[06:46:43] <Ravenna> Thank you for that book recommendation. I am going to note it down now so I can look it up later
[06:48:12] <Hrafnbjorn> anything written by her is worth reading, although it can get a bit stuffy for some folk cause she gets into linguistics and such, which can make things feel stuffy... but it also makes it more thorough
[06:49:10] <Hrafnbjorn> the book about Freyr is very short though... the bibliography is as long as the actual text, lol
[06:50:14] <Ravenna> I actually like it when an author covers linguistics and other background material to supplement their presentations. It provides more layers of understanding
[06:50:26] <Hrafnbjorn> I agree
[06:51:59] <Ravenna> Did you ever get a chance to read Runic Amulets and Objects by Mindy MacCleod and Bernard Mees?
[06:52:22] <Hrafnbjorn> it also allows for cross-cultural exploration when the linguistics go back before the culture(s) in question... with Heathen related stuff, much can be traced back to the proto-Indo-Europeans, so when ya get into the linguistics, it gives thoughts and auch ranging from Scandinavian, to Greek, to Indian philosophy
[06:52:32] <Hrafnbjorn> no, I have not read it
[06:52:59] <Hrafnbjorn> auch=such
[06:54:49] <Hrafnbjorn> an example of how linguistics sheds light is how most folk associate Zeus and Odin together, when in reality it should be Tyr and Zeus.  When ya look to linguistics you find Tyrs oldest name Ziu ties him to Zeus... and then in the Sanskrit to Deva
[06:54:49] <Ravenna> Oh yes. I would definitely recommend reading J.P. Mallory's In Search of theIndo Europeans and Ceisiwr Serith's Deep Ancestors: Practicing the Religion of the Proto Indo Europeans
[06:55:28] <Hrafnbjorn> I will have to look into that. thanks
[06:55:30] <Ravenna> I have a pdf. I don't know how to post link but if you want I can email it to you if you pm me your email
[06:56:06] <Hrafnbjorn> sure, here it comes :)

[07:30:09] <Keith> anyone know of any good remedies for sore muscles?
[07:30:35] <Hrafnbjorn> depends on why they are sore
[07:30:46] <Hrafnbjorn> cold bath works wonders
[07:30:55] <Keith> i think it was the way i slept on a hard floor
[07:30:55] <Hrafnbjorn> or warm bath with epsom salts
[07:31:05] <Keith> i should really try one of those
[07:31:58] <Hrafnbjorn> a preventative measure is lots of stretching... flexibiliy pevents damage, and helps keep the lactic acid flushed out of muscles

[07:34:42] <Keith> i should start stretching more
[07:35:28] <MissSugar> i would love to be a swamp witch 
[07:35:33] <MissSugar> but the humidity would kill me
[07:35:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I couldn't take that, either
[07:36:00] <Hrafnbjorn> have you seen American Horror Story: Coven, MissSugar?
[07:36:12] <MissSugar> no not yet
[07:36:27] <MissSugar> i watched the first 2 seasons and then kinda wandered off from there
[07:36:36] <Hrafnbjorn> one of the characters in it is called a swamp witch
[07:37:16] <Hrafnbjorn> it is likely way off on its portrayal of voodoo though
[07:38:41] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Most things that come out of Hollyweird are way off in their portrayal of ANY kind of magic.
[07:39:13] <MissSugar> oh yeah
[07:39:28] <MissSugar> i saw their papa legba and i was like "dude you guys are confused"
[07:40:09] <Hrafnbjorn> I thought he was a cool character, but assumed it wasnt accurate
[07:40:09] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I think you were being kind with that
[07:40:15] <MissSugar> Legba is an old man who tells stories, and sometimes plays pranks, but is mostly a sweet old man
[07:40:32] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, they were way off then, lol
[07:41:27] <MissSugar> eh i cant get too mad at hollywood, those types of myths sale
[07:41:40] <MissSugar> they couldnt give a hoot about authenticity 
[07:42:14] <Hrafnbjorn> while I do feel that modern stories still fit into mythic models, they often take too great a liberty with some of the traditional characters... such as making Thor a woman in the new comics, lol
[07:42:38] <MissSugar> yeah you heathens have it rougher than the voodooists do
[07:42:42] <raevynskkyyemt> He still exists. She just gains his powers
[07:43:13] <Hrafnbjorn> wasnt that how the male comic Thor was too?  
[07:43:17] <raevynskkyyemt> And he treats the name as a title that goes with the powers 
[07:43:55] <Hrafnbjorn> I seem to remember a Thor vs Hulk comic where Thor was just a guy that found Mjolnir, and so could take on Thors power
[07:44:46] <raevynskkyyemt> Whoever is worthy of wailing mjolnir can take on the powers of Thor. There have been several people who have done so in the comics
[07:44:59] <raevynskkyyemt> I
[07:45:05] <raevynskkyyemt> Wielding
[07:45:24] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> At the very beginning, he was a hobbled physician who found an old walking stick, and when he smacked the end of o it on the ground, he became Thor, and the walking stick became Mjolnir.
[07:45:58] <Hrafnbjorn> ah, ok... in the mythology it isnt a matter of being worthy, its a matter of strength... even Thor himself, while the strongest being, could stillnot lift mjolnir without his girdle and gloves
[07:45:59] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The doctor's name was Donald Blake
[07:46:58] <Hrafnbjorn> Thor would have been most worthy of all the gods, of course, but that just wasnt part of the story
[07:47:09] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I remember that from the book I read, Hrafnbjorn
[07:47:17] <Hrafnbjorn> Thor didnt have some of the darker aspects the other gods had
[07:47:44] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> He was a more heroic figure than the others, that's sure.
[07:48:09] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[07:49:29] <Hrafnbjorn> Thor and Freyr were the most commonly worshiped gods in Heathenism, but different social classes... Thor was common mans god, Freyr was more royal, and priestly class
[07:50:12] <Hrafnbjorn> also depended on time period too though... the later the period the more popular Thor was
[07:50:30] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yup
[07:52:59] <Hrafnbjorn> Odin was not popular in pre-modern period.... now he is most popular

[08:08:07] <Chiaro> Thing is, I remember everything, it seems, even though it was 45 years ago.  Funny how the world is always changing, but moments never do.
[08:10:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> True enough, Chiaro
[08:10:42] <Hrafnbjorn> the very name 'world' coming from Old Saxon wereld means 'old changer'

[08:12:40] <Chiaro> or not
[08:20:01] <Hrafnbjorn> anyone have topic idea?
[08:20:42] <Chiaro> I have an interesting quote from Friedrich Nietzsche
[08:21:05] <Hrafnbjorn> ?
[08:21:38] <Chiaro> ‚ÄúNo artist tolerates reality‚Ä¶ We have art lest we perish of the truth.‚Äù

[08:22:57] <Abraxas> Welcome, Widdershins. Ultimately though it is up to each individual to decide how they wish to perceive reality.  Which is how it should be.
[08:22:59] <Abraxas> We can only be what we give ourselves the power to be.
[08:23:00] <Hrafnbjorn> hhm, that is a nice quote
[08:23:06] <Hrafnbjorn> wb Widdershins
[08:23:39] <Chiaro> Suggesting that the purpose of art is to manufacture substance with which one can "cover the void"
[08:25:01] <Chiaro> Interesting to think that we are constantly trying to avoid that Void
[08:25:10] <Hrafnbjorn> I think, personaly that words fall way short in expressing much of what we MUST express... so we have art, which is our best way to express those.  Of course words and art do try to cross paths in poetry
[08:25:14] <Keith> howdy Widdershins
[08:26:11] <Chiaro> No, art is a general term, not meaning pictures... art is the domain of any artistic endeavor
[08:26:36] <Hrafnbjorn> I am not speaking just of pictures
[08:27:31] <Hrafnbjorn> dance, for example, is the expression of how sound moves you
[08:28:24] <Keith> art is anything creative in nature
[08:29:05] <Chiaro> Yes, but are we exploring what exists, or creating a fa√ßade to distract us from the underlying emptiness?
