[00:14:39] <Aria> Yup
[00:14:42] <Aria> I had a crash earlier today
[00:14:49] <Aria> But that's because I just dumped this energy everywhere
[00:14:56] <Aria> Into things that didn't mind
[00:15:02] <Aria> (objects)(
[00:15:06] <Aria> (glasses of water)
[00:15:10] <SpiritSong> ahh
[00:15:14] <Aria> (and people who consented to experiencing a RUSH OF ENERGY WEEEEEEE)
[00:15:29] <Aria> and eventually I had spent it all
[00:15:29] <North> who wouldn't consent to that!
[00:15:31] <Aria> but I needed to
[00:15:43] <Aria> because I had a dinner thing at someone's house
[00:15:46] <Aria> and I didn't want to show up all hyper
[00:15:48] <Aria> but I did anyway
[00:15:50] <Aria> I was hyper
[00:15:50] <North> lol
[00:15:59] <Aria> so at that dinner party I dumped even more energy.. into objects
[00:16:01] <North> ah well...you gave it a shot
[00:16:05] <Aria> and then I got a crash
[00:16:08] <Aria> for a few hours
[00:16:12] <Aria> and now i'm back in my rush

[00:54:36] <BansheeTears> Not bad
[00:54:53] <North> cricketty whispering
[00:54:58] <BansheeTears> Lol!!!
[00:55:08] <North> I have no plans to try this thing, btw
[00:55:18] * BansheeTears picks het teeth with a leg
[00:55:37] <BansheeTears> Just overlook some popcorn
[00:55:43] * North looks on, expression reasonably neutral
[00:55:44] <BansheeTears> Overlook
[00:55:53] <Aria> okay I dumped into a crystal
[00:55:57] <BansheeTears> Damn autocorrect
[00:55:58] <Aria> that felt amazin
[00:56:10] <BansheeTears> Grounding is your friend
[00:56:27] <Aria> Before I ground I'm gonna use these rushes to charge all my stuff!!!
[00:56:45] <BansheeTears> It's nice to ride the wave a bit... But ya can crash like a bad espresso mornin
[00:56:54] <North> that crystal might get big bucks on eBay
[00:57:28] * North offers a not-well-thought-out suggestion
[00:57:42] <BansheeTears> I never use residual energy to charge.. Think it's best to use straight energy from the source
[00:57:55] <BansheeTears> It's always pure
[00:58:09] <Aria> This energy is coming from within me!!!!
[00:58:13] <BansheeTears> Moon sun elemental
[00:58:13] <Aria> And it keeps regenerating!!!!
[00:58:16] <Aria> Its awesomeeee!!!
[00:58:28] <Aria> I need to learn to control ittt!!!
[00:58:35] <BansheeTears> Might need to go hug a tree

[01:00:46] <Aria> and then a crash

[01:33:48] <BansheeTears> We went swimming last night and had bbq
[01:33:57] <SpiritSong> did you have fun?
[01:33:59] <BansheeTears> Was a really nice night
[01:34:09] <BansheeTears> He's dropped about 30 lbs
[01:34:20] <BansheeTears> Trying to get healthy
[01:34:33] <SpiritSong> ooh well done to him!
[01:34:39] <BansheeTears> Ikr!
[01:34:52] <SpiritSong> thats such a great achievement
[01:35:25] <BansheeTears> He's really trying.  My mom is still griping about it
[01:35:37] <SpiritSong> why is she griping?
[01:35:47] <BansheeTears> She wants him to get healthy, but she wants to go out to dinner all the time
[01:36:00] <BansheeTears> And she gets bent when he says no
[01:36:05] <SpiritSong> ahhhh
[01:36:23] <BansheeTears> But he's sticking up for himself
[01:36:30] <SpiritSong> maybe they can do the movies more instead if she wants to get out
[01:36:36] <SpiritSong> or something with music
[01:37:00] <BansheeTears> The movies always end in a candy and hot dog bender
[01:37:05] <SpiritSong> ahhh
[01:37:14] <BansheeTears> They need an outlet that's not food oriented
[01:37:34] <BansheeTears> But it will develop in time
[01:37:34] <SpiritSong> yup really do
[01:37:56] <BansheeTears> She's just gonna have to handle no
[01:38:09] <SpiritSong> but im biased on that because i dont trust outside food to be clean lmao...it has to be cooked by me, family or a friend before i fully trsut it
[01:38:36] <BansheeTears> My mom loves Chinese food, and red lobster

[02:04:44] <Aria> ii shouldnt have said thhat
[02:09:10] <Edward> Aria, im going to try and be polite and nice about this, but I think you are acting alittle bit ridiculous 
[02:09:24] <Aria> uhuuhhhhh
[02:12:05] <North> you're just bitter because she wasn't quick to return your greeting
[02:12:16] * North arrives at the only reasonable conclusion
[02:15:11] <Edward> Yes
[02:15:14] <Edward> That is the reason
[02:15:29] <Edward> You see through me, good sir
[02:19:56] <SpiritSong> she's grand, just excited
[02:21:12] <SpiritSong> and honest if you really feel that and she's your friend you should have said that in pm
[02:21:13] <SpiritSong> :)
[02:21:30] <Iona> Aria is on a brain chemical pleasure rush?
[02:22:11] <SpiritSong> magickal energy she reckons :)
[02:22:45] <Aria> im in trance now its helping. or maybe not trance, i dont know, i just managed to put myself into a calm state
[02:22:47] <Edward> Aria is on meth
[02:23:02] <Aria> im not, Edward 
[02:23:08] <Edward> I believe you
[02:23:18] <SpiritSong> leave her alone
[02:23:25] <Edward> Leave britney alone!
[02:23:29] <Aria> this is actually starting to become a problem because I need to sleep
[02:23:33] <Aria> it's like 02:23AM
[02:23:39] <Edward> Go sleepies
[02:23:52] <Edward> Seek the precious
[02:23:53] <Aria> and any time I release the energy (which does really help), in like a minute it builds up again
[02:24:02] <Aria> but i seem to have found a solution.. for now
[02:24:17] <Edward> When is the last time you have slept, oh Aria one
[02:24:25] <Aria> yesterday night
[02:24:43] <SpiritSong> aria have you tried the "tree meditation?
[02:24:53] <Aria> What is that?
[02:26:05] <SpiritSong> its basically being a tree in a visual energy work excercise and you draw the energy out through your feet into the earth
[02:26:11] <SpiritSong> or roots rather :)
[02:26:17] <SpiritSong> its a grounding excercise
[02:26:45] <North> surprisingly effective, that
[02:26:57] <SpiritSong> yup yip
[02:30:13] <Aria> im grounding
[02:30:18] <Aria> contineous flow into the earth
[02:30:27] <Aria> i didnt realise i needed to be constantly dumping right now
[02:30:35] <Aria> its helping
[02:30:46] <North> good stuff
[02:30:49] <SpiritSong> thats good :)
[02:30:56] <North> feel your roots going deep down into the cool earth
[02:31:08] <Aria> i usually see it as beams of light into the earth
[02:31:12] <Aria> is that bad?
[02:31:24] <SpiritSong> ^whatever works for you
[02:31:25] <SpiritSong> :)
[02:31:27] <Aria> :)
[02:31:34] <Aria> like, i'm used to grounding, but...
[02:31:42] <Aria> I noticed grounding itself didn't help
[02:31:49] <Aria> but right now I am constantly dumping my energy into the Earth
[02:31:50] <North> when my dad died, I didn't know how I was going to get through the funeral
[02:31:51] <Aria> It's working :)
[02:31:54] <Aria> I am calm again
[02:32:15] <North> someone suggested the tree grounding exercise...which I didn't think would work
[02:32:17] <North> but it did
[02:32:33] <SpiritSong> its an amazing excercise
[02:32:37] * North nods
[02:32:56] <Aria> I wonder if this does the earth any good
[02:33:00] <Aria> contineous flow of energy into it
[02:33:07] <Aria> I've never done this before, I usually run out
[02:33:39] <SpiritSong> giving back to the earth is all good :)
[02:34:43] <Aria> okay :)
[02:36:03] <SpiritSong> :)
[02:37:54] * North predicts happy sleeps
[02:41:14] <SpiritSong> ?:P
[02:41:31] <Aria> mmmmmm
[02:41:35] <Aria> this is amazing
[02:41:41] <Aria> I am calm again
[02:42:02] <SpiritSong> thats awesome
[02:42:04] <SpiritSong> :)
[02:42:22] <Aria> so then I thinkwe can all agree that it was magickal energy
[02:44:30] <SpiritSong> sounds like it :)
[02:44:43] <SpiritSong> but the tree meditation is good for any excess energy

[03:26:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Aria, if I may be so bold, what was vausing your lack of calm?
[03:26:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> causing
[03:26:38] <Aria> A massive energy rush that just kept recharging no matter how much energy I dumped
[03:27:07] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ah. I have had this experience. It's rather unsettling.
[03:27:12] <Aria> I dumped so much energy
[03:27:16] <Aria> It is... but it's also quite nice
[03:27:18] <Aria> However...
[03:27:24] <Aria> My body was shaking and so was my laptop
[03:27:31] <Aria> Eventually I got a headache
[03:27:35] <Aria> after like 4 hours of rushing
[03:27:42] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yup
[03:27:57] <Aria> Not many people believed me
[03:28:33] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> You must have been hanging around muggles at the time.

[03:30:23] <Edward> If by muggles you mean people in another witches chat
[03:30:24] <Edward> Then yes
[03:30:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> They are usually unlikely to understand, as whatever spiritual paths they follow don't se such things.

[03:31:13] <Edward> If you get my drift
[03:31:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> No, Edward. By muggles, I mean non-magickal people.
[03:31:27] <Edward> I know what you meant
[03:31:28] <Edward> hahaha
[03:31:38] <Edward> Ive seen the Arry Potta movies
[03:32:08] <Edward> Yer a Wizerd Arry
[03:32:17] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I also use the word 'mundane' to describe the so-called 'normal' people.
[03:32:29] <Edward> I like muggle better though
[03:32:30] <Edward> c:
[03:32:57] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, mundane is less insulting, I suppose.
[03:33:20] <Edward> Its not like you are calling non-magickal folk mud bloods
[03:33:22] <Edward> c:
[03:33:41] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Plus, some steampunk groups have adopted the word muggle to describe people outside their group.
[03:33:49] <Edward> Hmm
[03:34:00] <Edward> Have to admit, steampunk is awesome
[03:34:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Quite a few of our local pagan community like steampunk, as well.
[03:35:46] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Some, because of the Victorian costumes.

[06:32:07] <Iona> I'm okayish, a bit drained, and my feet hurt from the new high heels...  it's been a good day :)
[06:32:31] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Hi, Iona
[06:32:44] <Hrafnbjorn> I will never understand the self torture that is high heels :)
[06:33:02] <AntleredGirl> Hi there Iona!
[06:33:12] <Iona> how is everyone today?
[06:33:13] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I'm ok, AntleredGirl. Hoping for good weather Saturday night for Full Moon ritual.
[06:33:57] <Iona> Hrafnbjorn: I agree, it's torture!
[06:34:04] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I once had a g/f who never wore high heels outside the house.
[06:34:09] <Hrafnbjorn> am well here, finally finished a set of rune-tines made from manzanita... talk about a labor intensive wood to work with
[06:34:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Is it harder than teak, Hrafnbjorn??
[06:35:15] <Hrafnbjorn> Im not sure if its harder or not, but it takes forever to sand it, and cutting with a saw is almost a no-go
[06:35:27] <Iona> why manzanita then?
[06:35:36] <Hrafnbjorn> the end product is worth the effort, but holy cow
[06:36:10] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> So, it's on a par with ebony, or even ironwood?
[06:36:12] <Hrafnbjorn> because its very pretty and abundant branches that heve fallen off, so I dont have to cut anything off the bush
[06:36:26] <Hrafnbjorn> it is a lot like working with iron wood, yeah
[06:36:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ah
[06:37:45] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That stuff is close to impossible to sand by hand.
[06:39:24] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed
[06:41:22] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> But, when it's done, and has a smooth finish, it looks waxed without even BEING waxed. it just has a natural sheen.
[06:42:16] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Also, it makes a good staff, as it doesn't break easily, if needed for defense.
[06:42:23] <Hrafnbjorn> yep, manzanita is same way, just different colors... you get pinks, tans' and greens out of manzanita

[19:33:49] * Aria pokes North and Iona 
[19:34:09] * Iona pokes Aria back! (not with my fingernails!)
[19:34:28] <Aria> I had a pretty bad experience today
[19:34:36] <Iona> would you like to share it?
[19:35:03] <Iona> or...
[19:35:05] * North pauses ice cream coning long enough to bite m'Aria
[19:35:08] <Iona> let's try a different thing...  
[19:35:21] <Iona> what is your body experiencing right now?...
[19:35:59] <Aria> my body, right now,
[19:36:02] <Aria> is experiencing the crash
[19:36:05] <Aria> from yesterday
[19:36:32] <Aria> like, after the rush
[19:36:46] <North> :/
[19:37:04] * Iona nods...
[19:37:09] <Iona> that's normal...  
[19:37:48] <Aria> but...
[19:38:02] <Aria> i had to explain that to someone who is taking care of me
[19:38:08] <Aria> why i had been in a hyperactive rush yesterday
[19:38:16] <Aria> and why i have a crash today
[19:38:22] <Aria> because the crash prevented me from going to work
[19:38:27] <Aria> and...
[19:39:01] <Aria> I had trouble explaining it in any way without magickal terms
[19:39:24] <North> was the explanation not well received?
[19:39:29] <Aria> Yup
[19:39:41] <Aria> They're not practitioners
[19:39:46] <North> poor crashy Aria
[19:39:51] * North commiserates
[19:39:52] <Aria> They probably either think i'm crazy or they believe me but think it's a problem
[19:40:25] <North> less than ideal
[19:40:53] <Aria> I kept telling her "I don't want to explain it, you won't believe me anyway"
[19:40:55] <Aria> But she kept pushing
[19:41:16] <Aria> So then I told yesterday's entire process to her
[19:41:46] <Aria> anyway yeah, i'm worried about that, because this really is none of their business
[19:41:47] <Aria> secondly
[19:42:03] <Aria> im so crashed i keep nearly falling asleep while standing
[19:42:12] <North> yikes
[19:42:21] * North proactively scatters pillows over the floor
[19:42:26] <Aria> also my senses feel numb
[19:42:34] <Aria> like, my "other" senses
[19:42:36] <North> curious
[19:42:46] <North> ah
[19:42:47] <Aria> well, i don't think it's very surprising with how overcharged I was yesterday
[19:43:05] <North> you were quite the firecracker
[19:43:09] <Aria> yeah >__<
[19:43:21] <Aria> and now the firecracker is burnt out
[19:43:24] <Aria> or, well,
[19:43:27] * North patpats
[19:43:33] <North> I predict a full recovery
[19:43:35] <Aria> the firecracker has turned off the hyperness and subsequently crashed
[19:43:37] <Aria> thank you
[19:44:20] * North gestures to the pillow-strewn floor
[19:44:26] <North> feel free to abruptly crash anywhere
[19:44:26] * Aria lays on the pillows
[19:44:35] * North looks on with approval
[19:44:49] * Aria looks gratefully at North 
[19:44:54] <North> you just get all the rest you need
[19:45:00] <Aria> Yes...
[19:45:10] * North drapes a warm blanky over the burnt out firecracker
[19:45:32] <Aria> Well, yesterday, I learnt to control it
[19:45:40] <Aria> So if this happens again.. I am prepared
[19:45:47] <North> excellent
[19:45:54] <North> a valuable learning experience
[19:45:58] <Aria> Yes
[19:46:13] <Aria> ..too bad I told too much to my caretaker whom now probably thinks I'm crazy....
[19:46:45] <North> your honesty is to be admired, at the very least
[19:48:42] <Aria> My honesty gets me in trouble
[19:48:58] <North> alas
[19:50:07] <Aria> Not the first time I told that person about something that went wrong with magick
[19:51:45] <North> she ought to be used to it by now, then   ;)
[19:57:43] <North> luckily, these events seem to be quite rare
[19:57:51] <North> so you might not have to worry about it for some time

[20:10:02] <Aria> In addition, we haven't really gotten to know eachother
[20:10:04] <Aria> Welllllll
[20:10:09] <Aria> Know how hyper I was yesterday?
[20:10:12] <Aria> Today is the crash.
[20:10:20] <SpiritSong> lol i know you werent spamming now its all good
[20:10:56] <SpiritSong> ahh, feeling low in energy? that can suck :/
[20:11:11] * North bites the silverbirdy

[20:11:20] <SpiritSong> ouch :(
[20:11:26] <North> :)
[20:11:29] <Aria> SpiritSong, more like my body got flushed with tons of energy yesterday and none is left today
[20:11:30] * SpiritSong rubs her wing

[20:14:01] <Witchit> Hi North :D Hi SpiritSong!
[20:14:35] * North considers biting Witchit, so she doesn't feel left out
[20:14:41] <Witchit> I'm so excited! I'm learning the ocarina, and after it came in the mail I've been playing it so much
[20:14:46] <Witchit> Wut
[20:14:55] <North> nm    ;)
[20:15:01] <Witchit> :P
[20:15:08] <North> the ocarina!
[20:15:18] * SpiritSong tries to think of something that will help the crash
[20:15:30] <SpiritSong> dont bite people!!!
[20:15:33] <Witchit> Crash? Is everything okay?

[20:15:49] <Witchit> Ohhh
[20:16:00] * North is magnanimously willing to donate ice cream to the energy-deprived Aria
[20:16:12] <North> food poisoning  lol
[20:16:23] <Witchit> Aw, feel better Aria :) Maybe you can wake yourself up with an activity?
[20:16:43] <Witchit> Take a walk, meditate, etc.
[20:16:47] <North> she's had more than enough activity, lately, truth be told!
[20:16:54] <Witchit> Ohh, gotcha
[20:17:02] <Witchit> I was just thinking of something simple
[20:17:06] <Witchit> Something healthy
[20:17:33] <SpiritSong> sitting with a tree would prolly help with low energy as well as too much
[20:17:59] <Witchit> Understandable...just tryin to help
[20:18:30] <North> restful music played on the ocarina may be helpful
[20:18:45] <North> because nothing wrong with resting
[20:18:45] <SpiritSong> Witchit that scrying mirror you made is pretty
[20:19:25] <SpiritSong> truth north
[20:19:31] * North secretly googles ocarina
[20:20:05] <North> ah, k
[20:20:08] <Witchit> Thanks SpiritSong!
[20:20:09] <North> not what I'd imagined
[20:20:13] <Witchit> That means a lot!
[20:20:47] <Witchit> Yeah North, I have a 4 hole one that looks like a strawberry
[20:20:57] <North> cool
[20:21:03] <Witchit> It also doubles as a necklace, which most ocarinas don't have
[20:21:31] <North> easy access...should the urge to play suddenly strike
[20:21:53] <Witchit> But sometimes it sounds like a recorder. Not fun for my parents when their child is screeching in their ear :P
[20:22:14] <SpiritSong> orcarinas are so pretty
[20:22:59] <Witchit> Yeah, I love them :) Though I got a high-pitched one, I appreciate the graceful look and feel
[20:23:38] <Witchit> I hate learning the simple songs though
[20:23:46] <Witchit> It's pretty tedious
[20:24:16] <North> not half as pretty as the ladies of this room, mind you
[20:24:21] * North shamelessly flatters
[20:24:24] <SpiritSong> yeah but once you master those, the more difficult ones will come easier ^_^
[20:24:27] <SpiritSong> lol north :)

[20:27:09] <Witchit> Though I'm really glad I've started to get used to Hot Cross Buns
[20:27:16] <Witchit> Which is basically Hell on Earth
[20:27:28] <North> oh, man
[20:27:52] <Witchit> If anyone has played an instrument, they remember Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
[20:27:52] <North> it's a rare type that can acclimate to that
[20:28:16] <Aria> thank you North  and Witchit 
[20:28:23] <Witchit> No problem Aria ^ ^
[20:28:30] <North> \o

[20:30:26] <Witchit> I'm not surprised Twinkle Twinkle Little Star is universal XD
[20:30:49] <SpiritSong> hehehe
[20:30:58] <SpiritSong> its meant to be "simple"
[20:30:59] <SpiritSong> hahaha
[20:31:04] <SpiritSong> but it wasnt for me
[20:31:13] <Witchit> Hahahahahahahahaha -cries softly into mirror-

[20:31:48] <Witchit> Hehehe
[20:32:03] <SpiritSong> lmao north
[20:33:27] <Witchit> The only downside of the ocarina is when my cat thinks it's a good idea to rub his side against my face, completely blocking my view of the notes
[20:33:38] <Witchit> And it happens every time I play
[20:34:04] <North> maybe he thinks he's an ocarina
[20:34:04] <SpiritSong> lmao have you seent hat vid of a girl singing on the cat is sitting on the guitar as she plays
[20:34:08] <North> typical cat delusion
[20:34:18] <Witchit> Hahahaha
[20:34:25] <North> haven't seen that thing, Birdy
[20:34:48] <Witchit> SpiritSong: Best cat video ever. North: My previous cats were attracted to my other instruments too
[20:35:10] <North> must be a cat thing
[20:35:16] <Witchit> So yeah, cats might be more attracted to music and rhythms
[20:35:48] <SpiritSong> its an aesome vid
[20:36:15] <SpiritSong> or he wants your attention and is livid the orcarina is getting more attention lmao
[20:36:18] <SpiritSong> mines like that

[20:47:10] <SpiritSong> go for it
[20:47:10] <Witchit> *:D
[20:47:15] <North> Prior to the release of When I Was a Boy, Siberry performed in Edinburgh as the opening act for Mike Oldfield's premiere of Tubular Bells 2. She met with a disastrous rejection by the audience. Initially, Siberry was devastated (later describing herself as having "cried for two weeks") and had to make a serious reassessment of her perspective on her work. From this point onwards, she chose to reclaim her art for herself and decided "I took back all t
[20:47:16] <North> myself trying to please (others). The worst show of my life has become the best show because it's given me the ultimate freedom to care only about what I think is really good. How my career does is secondary."[10]

[22:53:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Sorry, I was checking FB
[22:53:16] <DarkWitch> had a tooth pulled today
[22:53:29] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ouchies!!
[22:53:41] <BansheeTears> It'll feel better Ina week
[22:53:52] <BansheeTears> Watch out for dry socket
[22:53:58] <DarkWitch> yeah, but worth it, that tooth was getting really sensitive and painful, it was interfering with my enjoyment of cookie dough ice cream
[22:54:07] <BansheeTears> Lol!
[22:54:13] <BansheeTears> Can't have that
[22:54:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I hate it when that happens, DarkWitch
[22:54:31] <DarkWitch> i know, it's horrible
[22:54:38] <SpiritSong> teeth issues are awful
[22:54:47] <BansheeTears> I second that
[22:54:49] <DarkWitch> soon as this heals I will be stocking up on the ice cream - lol
[22:54:53] <SpiritSong> lol
[22:54:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And, where I live, not being able to enjoy ice cream is a wrongness.
[22:54:56] <SpiritSong> do it!!
[22:54:59] <BansheeTears> Enduring them long term is agony
[22:55:10] <DarkWitch> it's wrong no matter where you live ArchrWndrMcRbrt
[22:55:12] <BansheeTears> Or cheese..
[22:55:20] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That, too, BansheeTears
[22:55:33] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I can't have it as often as I'd like.
[22:55:40] <BansheeTears> Lactose?
[22:55:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And for a Wisconsinite, not being able to enjoy dairy is painful
[22:56:07] <BansheeTears> No kidding
[22:56:09] <DarkWitch> I can imagine
[22:56:18] <BansheeTears> Though cheese curds wig me out
[22:56:39] <DarkWitch> so I'm really loving the info from my current class, it's a history class on the European Reformations
[22:56:48] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> My body chemistry is such that my arteries clog easily if I have a lot of dairy, so I have to have limited amounts
[22:56:55] <BansheeTears> Ahh
[22:57:01] <BansheeTears> Sounds interesting
[22:57:06] <DarkWitch> it's fascinating
[22:57:36] <BansheeTears> What school is it ? Phoenix?
[22:57:45] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I have a friend here who has developed lactiose intolerance. And, like most people in this state, he grew up on dairy\
[22:57:58] <DarkWitch> Arizona State University, online
[22:58:10] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> poor guy, it makes him ill, now.
[22:58:12] <BansheeTears> My da has it too.. Makes him miserable
[22:58:30] <BansheeTears> Heard good things about them
[22:58:41] <BansheeTears> Very flexible
[22:58:44] <DarkWitch> we thought my granddaughter might be lactose sensitive, but we took her off dairy for almost a month and she was still farting a lot
[22:59:12] <DarkWitch> yeah BansheeTears, it's been pretty good, and they are adding so many new classes to the online curriculum
[22:59:31] <BansheeTears> You going for your masters?
[22:59:40] <DarkWitch> lol, no, bachelor's

[23:00:03] <DarkWitch> I have an associates degree from the Community College of the Air Force, I got that when I was still active duty
[23:00:05] <BansheeTears> Would love to go back to school
[23:00:32] <DarkWitch> it is BansheeTears, and I'm not even really worried about getting the degree, I'm just taking classes that I think are interesting
[23:00:46] <BansheeTears> Heck yea
[23:00:58] <BansheeTears> Is it expensive?
[23:01:04] <DarkWitch> and the online thing gives me the flexibility I need, there are deadlines for turning in the work but I can watch the video lectures and stuff when I can
[23:01:20] <DarkWitch> since I never know when Iw ill be able to leave my house or not
[23:01:39] <BansheeTears> Lack of vehicle?
[23:01:53] <DarkWitch> I don't know how much it costs actually, cause the GI bill is paying for it, but you should check it out BansheeTears, you never know, maybe you could swing some kind of grant or something for it
[23:02:21] <BansheeTears> Ya never know unless ya try I guess
[23:02:30] <DarkWitch> no, I have a car, but with my pain issues I never know from one minute to the next how I will be feeling, so I can't be on a class schedule cause I don't know if I will be able to attend the classes or not
[23:02:42] <BansheeTears> I hear that
[23:03:34] <BansheeTears> Folks don't get it.. When you deal with chronic pain, nothing is in concrete
[23:03:39] <DarkWitch> I thought it would be hard to do the online thing, but I find that I really enjoy it, and it's not so hard to keep myself on track to get the work done

[23:04:21] <DarkWitch> yep, it's so hard for people to understand that I can't predict this pain, sometimes I am ok and then WHAM!  a huge wave of pain hits out of nowhere
[23:04:41] <BansheeTears> Fibro?
[23:04:44] <DarkWitch> yes
[23:05:09] <BansheeTears> That's so hard, cause so many people don't understand it
[23:05:37] <DarkWitch> yeah, but at least I don't have to worry about working or anything, with my disability pay I get by

[23:07:56] <BansheeTears> :) try
[23:07:58] <DarkWitch> I take a hydrocodone/ibuprofen blend when the pain spasms have been so bad they make my muscles ache, but it doesn't help with the actual fibro pain
[23:07:59] <BansheeTears> Ty
[23:08:07] <DarkWitch> no, those didn't work for me BansheeTears
[23:08:38] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Strong name for a strong woman.
[23:08:43] <BansheeTears> Yea, it does help dull the aggravation of it for me

[23:09:09] <Alari> Definitely :)
[23:09:11] <Alari> I like it
[23:09:36] <BansheeTears> And pain affects people so differently
[23:10:45] <BansheeTears> Getting dive bombed by a gnat...
[23:10:56] <DarkWitch> yes it does, the dentist had to use almost twice as much novocaine to pull my tooth cause fibro makes everything so wonky
[23:11:39] <BansheeTears> They have to for me too.. For me it's the anxiety interferes with the nova ain't, because of the endorphins
[23:12:01] <BansheeTears> Novacaine*
[23:12:28] <BansheeTears> Not nova ain't
[23:12:41] <BansheeTears> Damn auto correct
[23:13:10] <DarkWitch> I use my magick trigger to deal with anxiety for stuff like that, and I used it today to help the root of the tooth come out, the root had a wierd hooked end and didn't want to come out
[23:13:19] <DarkWitch> after I did the trigger, it came on out ok
[23:13:31] <BansheeTears> Cool .
[23:13:46] <DarkWitch> yeah, it helped
[23:13:47] <BansheeTears> I've had some really bad dentist experiences
[23:14:03] <BansheeTears> Like pliers and no numbing agents
[23:14:12] <DarkWitch> I can imagine, I think dentists are all sadists and they were trained by the Spanish Inquisitors
[23:14:22] <SpiritSong> jeese, sadistic dentist
[23:14:45] <BansheeTears> They held me down and pulled them out while I was screaming
[23:15:01] <SpiritSong> why on earth did they not use numbing agents
[23:15:02] <DarkWitch> ouch, was that a real dentist?
[23:15:08] <BansheeTears> Yup
[23:15:08] * SpiritSong shudders
[23:15:19] <DarkWitch> you should have sued them, that was just wrong
[23:15:31] <BansheeTears> I was 16
[23:15:58] <DarkWitch> did you at least bite them?
[23:16:01] <DarkWitch> I would have
[23:16:15] <BansheeTears> The dentist missed with the needle.. I kept telling them.. But they wouldn't stop
[23:16:26] <BansheeTears> I should have
[23:16:28] <DarkWitch> I would have bitten them and spit blood on them
[23:16:54] <DarkWitch> what did your parents say about it?
[23:16:54] <SpiritSong> rat bastards
[23:16:57] <SpiritSong> >_>
[23:17:12] <SpiritSong> the dentist people i mean

[23:19:04] <BansheeTears> It's ok. Now I'm stronger, and fight back
[23:19:09] <DarkWitch> good
[23:19:21] <SpiritSong> id end up pucnhing the doc
[23:20:17] <BansheeTears> We go through stuff as kids cause we don't want to look weak. In my family fighting back would have been weak. " tough it out " kinda family
[23:20:24] <DarkWitch> lol, of course I've always been a bitch, so fighting was always an instinct for me, your not a bitch so it's harder for you, your first instinct isn't to fight whereas mine is

[23:26:09] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Boysenberry
[23:26:16] <DarkWitch> I had a Boston Cream Pie flavored Yoplait Light
[23:26:21] <DarkWitch> it was yummy
[23:26:22] <BansheeTears> Omg.. That was mine too!!
[23:26:35] <BansheeTears> Damon fruit on the bottom
[23:26:45] <BansheeTears> Dannon
[23:26:59] * SpiritSong returns with her yoghurt and untangled herself from the lassoe
[23:27:02] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I don't think so, DarkWitch. Someone on your "Ignore" list stays there until you take them off, or they chnge IP address.
[23:27:05] <BansheeTears> Ever try the cherry ?
[23:27:08] <DarkWitch> ArchrWndrMcRbrt, you can make it yourself, just get plain vanilla yogurt and add the berries
[23:27:17] <DarkWitch> cool ArchrWndrMcRbrt, thanks
[23:27:40] <DarkWitch> lol, I guess I started a trend by talking about yogurt
[23:27:47] <DarkWitch> now SpiritSong is eating it
[23:27:56] <BansheeTears> Lol!
[23:28:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That's the stuff, BansheeTears. I'd freeze them, and take them to work for lunch. By lunch time, they had thawed enough to eat, but were still cool.
[23:28:01] <SpiritSong> i was hungry, you gave me ideas:)
[23:28:24] <BansheeTears> I used to do that in my lunchbox
[23:28:30] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yup
[23:28:40] <BansheeTears> Strawberry was good too
[23:28:53] <BansheeTears> Loved the stuff ya had to stir
[23:28:58] <SpiritSong> i haave a straberries and cream one
[23:29:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I tried pretty much ALL the Dannon flavors, back then. Late 70's
[23:29:19] <BansheeTears> Didn't like the chocolate of coffee ones
[23:29:26] <DarkWitch> my granddaughter really likes those Gogurt things
[23:29:36] <BansheeTears> Strawberries and cream.. Food of the gods
[23:29:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Choclate was ok, I didn't care for the coffe, either.
[23:30:11] <BansheeTears> I never had them
[23:30:12] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Coffee should be drunk, not eaten.
[23:30:23] <BansheeTears> Kids here like to freeze them
[23:30:32] <BansheeTears> Agreed ArchrWndrMcRbrt
[23:30:41] <BansheeTears> Brb
[23:31:22] <DarkWitch> bet she went to get a yogurt - lol
[23:32:10] <SpiritSong> lol
[23:32:51] <DarkWitch> ok, my head is feeling like it's gonna float away from my body, I think I need a nap cause I hate this feeling
