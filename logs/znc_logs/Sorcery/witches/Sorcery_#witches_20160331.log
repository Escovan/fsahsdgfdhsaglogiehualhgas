[00:35:29] <North> pretty good on the whole, thanks
[00:35:33] <North> how's things by you?
[00:36:11] <Hrafnbjorn> I cannot complain :)
[00:36:23] <North> excellent

[01:09:01] <North> the Weather Network's presentation seems somewhat hysterical
[01:10:19] <Hrafnbjorn> weather is big news I guess
[01:10:26] <North> meteorological info conveyed in the sort of tone usually expressed by someone reporting from the bottom of a collapsed mine shaft
[01:11:50] <Hrafnbjorn> weather is meant to be 'small talk' so perhaps they must report that way to feel important when being professional small-talkers?
[01:12:02] <North> lol
[01:12:23] <North> you've nailed it, friend
[01:12:35] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[01:13:19] <North> it troubles me, to be candid
[01:14:41] <Hrafnbjorn> I guess the opposite is bad too.  I watch the European and Japanese news fairly often (cause I put TV on PBS, and leave it) and they seem so complacant when reporting disasters and terrorist attacks

[01:15:08] * North nods
[01:15:45] <Hrafnbjorn> could just be a language thing in those cases too I suppose... a German, or Japanese man reporting in English might seem less... enthusiastic or somethin
[01:16:21] <North> we're still hardwired to the Past
[01:16:52] <North> people were designed to live in communities no greater than a couple of hundred, maybe
[01:17:08] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[01:17:26] <North> people you encountered every day
[01:17:51] <Hrafnbjorn> in response to that we came up with the 'civilization' philosophy, which seems to be self-destructive so far
[01:18:15] <North> kind of an experiment, I suppose
[01:18:24] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed
[01:20:15] <Hrafnbjorn> it has had some good manifestations though... arts would not be what they are, intellectual things would probably be less formalized... non-civilized lifestyle was also hugely violent
[01:20:34] <North> agreed
[01:20:49] <North> cost/benefit
[01:21:59] <North> not an altogether comfortable arrangement
[01:23:24] <Hrafnbjorn> I fear, that since success and failure of civilization revolves directly around education, when we manipulate education, and fall short about the things we need to be educated about for civilization, we doom ourselves to failure

[02:12:22] <MCMLXV> sounds cool

[02:15:08] <Mim> black cats are $10 here :/
[02:15:15] <MCMLXV> later, we saw 3 dead black birds in the ditch (in close proximity to each other)

[02:15:48] <Mim> ooo...idk what that would mean, MCM
[02:15:49] <Hrafnbjorn> well, elves were not from THIS world... it was comparative mythology movement that classified them with that sort of thing... in Iceland they were classified along with the Irish Fae as Huldrfolk (hidden folk) though, but that was not the mythic elves, just use of the term to bridge Old Icelandic and Old Irish
[02:16:55] <Mim> right, I have read something similar, Hraf

[02:17:57] <Hrafnbjorn> in Heathenism, there was a belief in a house spirit though, called Husvaettr
[02:17:57] <Mim> ^ that's just according to some stories
[02:18:13] <Hrafnbjorn> I dunno the lore for the Fae, so I dunno
[02:18:18] <Mim> so, while we may welcome them, they're shy of us
[02:18:43] <Hrafnbjorn> would make sense
[02:19:00] <Mim> I give them cookies n stuff this time of year
[02:19:17] <Mim> I think they took one of my boxes
[02:19:24] <Quad> fae, are mischeivious
[02:19:29] <Mim> it's carved with the triple moon on it 
[02:19:39] <Mim> I can't find it anywhere
[02:19:45] <Quad> sometimes fatay so
[02:19:59] <Quad> fatally
[02:20:06] <MCMLXV> I'm mischevious
[02:20:13] <Mim> me too
[02:20:14] <MCMLXV> sometimes fataly so
[02:20:38] <MCMLXV> well..... never been fatal, but have caused bodily injury
[02:20:42] <Mim> there is lore that says the fae used to collect humans on Samhain
[02:20:46] <MCMLXV> mostly to myself
[02:20:55] <Mim> lol
[02:21:05] <Quad> trick or treat
[02:21:23] <Mim> I was in the mood for a certain kind of music lately...guess what I found!
[02:21:28] <MCMLXV> ?
[02:22:53] <Quad> i think she's building suspense
[02:22:57] <MCMLXV> nods
[02:22:59] * North guesses the 'Badger Badger' one
[02:23:37] <Quad> perhaps it's the song that never ends
[02:23:39] <North> man...that would be the ultimate revenge on noisy neighbours
[02:23:58] <North> played on a loop at top volume

[04:01:55] <SpiritSong2> :P
[04:08:20] <Iona> Quad, words of wisdom from a woman:  good looks come out of a bottle - it's a facade, not the real person underneath...
[04:08:47] <MissSugar> i like my make up
[04:08:51] <Quad> oh, plz, i'm gorgeous
[04:09:03] <Iona> I do too MissSugar
[04:09:17] <MissSugar> im fierce when i put my make up on
[04:09:29] <North> a form of self expression
[04:09:35] * Iona giggles at the thought of a certain someone here touting things like glittery eyelashes as "beauty"...
[04:09:35] <North> or even play
[04:09:39] <Quad> i'm fierce without makeup
[04:10:00] <Quad> but i love glitter
[04:10:09] <Quad> makes me sparkle

[04:12:07] <Iona> mmmm nope, not a nightmare for everyone!  
[04:12:34] <Quad> though after the heels topic, it's starting to make too much sense

[18:20:02] <North> greetings, Escovan 
[18:20:41] <Escovan> hi North 
[18:20:48] <North> how's the day?
[18:22:05] <Escovan> In the Netherlands, at April 6th we vote about the association treaty between the EU and the Ukraïne. Today campaign was held at my town. I visited. 
[18:22:29] <North> ah, k
[18:23:22] <Escovan> And I got my hair cut ... wanna see?
[18:23:38] <Escovan> https://test.prutsplek.nl/20160331_kappervoorna.jpg
[18:24:40] <North> avoiding links, thanks
[18:24:47] <North> although I will hear a brief description
[18:25:35] <Escovan> It´s a image ... on the server I connect from. It´s OK :P - Long hair first, then millimetered
[18:25:51] <Escovan> It has SSL! :D
[18:27:29] <North> I have a question
[18:28:55] <Escovan> k
[18:29:10] <North> are you happy with the cut?
[18:29:34] <Escovan> yes, saves me 45 EUR on a yearly basis

[18:36:06] <North> it would appear that WebChat|66910 has resumed looking for love in all the wrong places
[18:36:59] <Escovan> It appears so.
[18:37:49] <Escovan> Maybe (s)he did click the link :P
[18:38:17] <North> we may never know
[18:38:47] <Escovan> I can check the serverlogs :)
[18:39:30] <North> one thing I do know, though: success is practically guaranteed with opening lines such as this:  <WebChat|66910> hi any one nede a date
[18:40:35] <Escovan> Yes, I´m in my Safe Space, and I feel like banging some other random internet person while pondering the reason to life ... and admitting so in public ...

[20:17:52] <Widdershins> dungeons*
[20:18:08] <PsychoMim> yes, I have a 20 page paper on marriage counselling due tomorrow
[20:18:23] <OddlyGentle> in a way but a more involved story-play
[20:18:24] <PsychoMim> of which I have 2 down
[20:18:27] <Widdershins> sorry typing is aweful- im pulling myself off my sleeping meds
[20:18:45] <Widdershins> sounds exiting...not
[20:19:18] <OddlyGentle> actually the storyline and histories are brilliant
[20:19:22] <Widdershins> tried to get first hubby to do counseling but ....men
[20:19:23] <OddlyGentle> not to brag lol
[20:19:44] <Widdershins> sounds involved
[20:19:50] <Widdershins> i do love a good story
[20:20:09] <Widdershins> is it more fantasy or horror leaning?
[20:20:25] <PsychoMim> I have to write ficticious case scenarios....I have no idea (except for my own experience) what to say
[20:20:34] <OddlyGentle> my game almost literally pulls you into it. It can be either one depends
[20:20:46] * PsychoMim eats a quinoa stick
[20:20:55] <PsychoMim> sorry...you were talking about games...
[20:21:03] <Widdershins> what about a hubby that gets into drugs due to work pressures?
[20:21:06] <PsychoMim> I like to play that blossom blast game....so fun
[20:21:57] <OddlyGentle> largely dependent upon which species you prefer to encounter first
[20:22:05] <Widdershins> ahh
[20:22:10] <DawnBat> making a Half-Elf race ^^
[20:22:14] <Widdershins> many different species?
[20:22:29] <OddlyGentle> anthropomorphic animal folk
[20:22:36] <OddlyGentle> so yes
[20:22:42] <Widdershins> very cool
[20:22:57] <Widdershins> sounds like something i would like
[20:23:18] <Widdershins> but i suck at games
[20:23:22] <Widdershins> big time
[20:23:26] <PsychoMim> me too
[20:23:27] <PsychoMim> lol
[20:23:27] <DawnBat> Widdershins the Lady Elf
[20:23:41] <PsychoMim> Wids, you'd probs like "snood"
[20:23:42] <Widdershins> I'd be happy as an elf :)
[20:23:51] <Widdershins> snood?
[20:23:59] <PsychoMim> I've also found a number of super cool witchy games for ipad
[20:24:00] <PsychoMim> lol
[20:24:19] <PsychoMim> snood is just an easy mindless game where you throw the right color ball and they drop off
[20:24:23] <DawnBat> Witchy PsychoMim :p
[20:24:24] <Widdershins> funny imma be on my ipad mostly here soon
[20:24:58] <Widdershins> think i'd lie a little more involvement
[20:25:05] <OddlyGentle> the gameplay is reactive so there is very wide margin for error without much risk of failure
[20:25:18] <OddlyGentle> and there are no dice to throw
[20:25:45] <OddlyGentle> I eliminated the dice bot to favor a more interactive experience
[20:25:49] <Widdershins> aww--- theres nothing like stepping on a 4 sided die
[20:26:10] <Widdershins> or an 8...
[20:26:14] <Widdershins> ouch
[20:26:35] <Widdershins> do you need to map your quest?
[20:26:43] <Widdershins> or adventur
[20:26:45] <Widdershins> e
[20:26:49] <Widdershins> ;)
[20:27:15] <DawnBat> gack
[20:27:22] <OddlyGentle> it is free roaming so no need for maps until after about eight boss battles in cannon play
[20:27:30] <PsychoMim> wids, did you say you're going off sleeping meds?
[20:27:37] <Widdershins> yup
[20:27:47] <OddlyGentle> there are not many locations that require a map at all
[20:27:54] <PsychoMim> for any particular reason?
[20:28:19] <Widdershins> dont like the drowsiness or the dependence
[20:28:29] <OddlyGentle> mostly because I play the part of everything but you
[20:28:32] <PsychoMim> ah...are they self prescribed?
[20:28:33] <Widdershins> pain  keeps me from sleeping well
[20:28:43] <Widdershins> nope dr prescribed
[20:29:00] <Widdershins> been on them for years
[20:29:30] <PsychoMim> is it day 1?
[20:29:34] <Widdershins> yup
[20:29:39] * PsychoMim nods
[20:29:45] <PsychoMim> hope all goes well
[20:29:59] <Widdershins> tonight will prolly be a bit long...

[20:30:06] <PsychoMim> I'm self medicating with chocolates
[20:30:15] <PsychoMim> I'll be about it you need to talk (that all nighter thing) 
[20:30:23] <PsychoMim> I have to take many breaks ;) 
[20:30:33] <OddlyGentle> I use essential oils for my pain
[20:30:35] <Widdershins> thanks :)
[20:30:42] <Widdershins> i do too
[20:30:45] <PsychoMim> what kind of pain, Oddly?
[20:31:00] <OddlyGentle> recurring injury symptoms
[20:31:17] <Widdershins> whats your oil of choice?
[20:31:26] <Widdershins> i like ginger a lot
[20:31:43] <OddlyGentle> hip, knee, back, and shoulder pain. now I like to use a mix of oils
[20:33:03] <PsychoMim> ginger is amazing for my allergies
[20:33:11] <PsychoMim> I haven't used the oil tho
[20:33:28] <OddlyGentle> 4theifs mixed with mint and frankincense works miracles
[20:33:43] <PsychoMim> ooo!
[20:33:45] <OddlyGentle> also good for itches
[20:33:49] <PsychoMim> that sounds really good!
[20:33:54] <Widdershins> ginger with eucalyptus, and lavender, and rosemary a touch of frankinsense
[20:34:10] <PsychoMim> you once sent me an amazing vile of lavender
[20:34:24] <PsychoMim> it was aaaaaawwwwwesooooome
[20:34:26] <Widdershins> would love to get yarrow oil but its a bit pricey
[20:34:38] <PsychoMim> have you ever used turmeric oil?
[20:34:40] <Widdershins> <3 i remember that- i thin
[20:34:44] <PsychoMim> I understand that's a good one
[20:34:50] <OddlyGentle> the mint is very therapeutic
[20:34:58] <Widdershins> yup tumeric is the bomb
[20:35:09] <Widdershins> i use it internally tho
[20:35:16] * PsychoMim nods
[20:35:20] <PsychoMim> I have a turmeric tea
[20:35:20] <Widdershins> i want the antiviral properties too
[20:35:32] <PsychoMim> and I also put it in our food a lot
[20:35:36] <OddlyGentle> brb
[20:35:56] <Widdershins> ever used the punch method for maing your own capsules
[20:36:03] <PsychoMim> it's supposed to help with memory too, right?
[20:36:09] <Widdershins> it does
[20:36:12] <PsychoMim> no, but I would love to do it!
[20:36:20] <Widdershins> its super easy
[20:36:36] <Widdershins> get your herb or spice ina shallow bowl
[20:36:42] <PsychoMim> oh, guess what! I have gossip (the good kind)
[20:36:56] <Widdershins> open the capsule and punch it into the herb till its packed
[20:37:05] <Widdershins> what?
[20:37:19] <PsychoMim> where do you get the capsule?
[20:37:31] <Widdershins> it'll save you a ton on bottles supplements and you always know its fresh

[20:48:49] <PsychoMim> never at the same time and it does sound like a cell phone, but it's outside and at an unusual distance
[20:49:08] <Widdershins> might be one trying to get your attention
[20:49:29] <OddlyGentle> back
[20:49:31] <PsychoMim> wb

[23:00:09] <DawnBat> what would The Burning Throne Room look like?
[23:00:12] <DawnBat> LAva and such
[23:01:08] <Iona> Hmmm.  What do you think?
[23:02:18] <DawnBat> thinking it'd be kind of firey
[23:05:06] <Iona> Hmmm...  because of what?
[23:05:36] <DawnBat> because it's part of The Infernal realms...
[23:06:22] <Iona> hmmmm, that may be true.
[23:06:41] <Iona> The River Styx for example, burned...  but maybe not for the same reasons or the same influence...
[23:07:16] <DawnBat> ah
[23:07:34] <DawnBat> this game is set roughly 15,000 years before the current date in my fnatasy series.
[23:07:49] <DawnBat> back when the Lord of Chaos was a single entity

[23:17:15] <DawnBat> Snowflakes are EVILLLL
[23:17:16] <DawnBat> :P
[23:17:41] <North> snow: manna from Hades
[23:18:46] <DawnBat> Yes
[23:19:22] <Iona> snow, beautiful water created from delicious moist cold...
[23:19:48] <DawnBat> well I made it so, in my game, when you speak to the Chaos Incarnate you are bound to Mortal Flesh and sent to the Mortal Planes
[23:22:15] <DawnBat> I think being forced into a Mortal Form would hurt
[23:22:58] <North> well, sure
[23:23:01] <North> ask anyone
[23:23:12] <DawnBat> :
[23:23:14] <DawnBat> :P
[23:27:04] * DawnBat vanquishes North\
[23:27:13] <North> mm hm
[23:27:27] <DawnBat> to the Trash Lands of the Infernal Realms!
[23:28:27] <North> anything but New Jersey
[23:28:33] <DawnBat> it's where trashy ladies go :)
[23:29:40] <DawnBat> maybe Jerseus could be an Infernal Realm
[23:30:24] <North> their state motto is very close to that, I think
[23:30:27] <DawnBat> I would like to an Infernal Realms map
[23:30:51] <DawnBat> Liberty and Prosperity is their motto
[23:31:22] <North> nothing about infernal realms?
[23:31:50] <DawnBat> nah
[23:31:56] <North> I'll be darned
[23:32:08] <DawnBat> the Middle Realms could house illusions.
[23:32:17] <DawnBat> Maybe one looks like New Jersey....IN WINTER
[23:32:29] <Iona> Ummm...  why mix politics and fantasy?
[23:32:42] <DawnBat> Iona: How am I doing that
[23:33:13] <Iona> It's like...  asking a city here to be named Mordor...
[23:33:43] <DawnBat> I don't see why not
[23:34:01] <DawnBat> The Infernal Realms are basically different facets of Chaos
[23:34:13] <DawnBat> the Illusionary Realms would be Lies
[23:35:04] <North> sign at city limits...'You are now leaving Mordor. Come back real soon!'   <Motorist> *hammering pedal to the floor*
[23:35:14] <DawnBat> xD
[23:35:22] <DawnBat> maybe make it in a volcanic area
[23:35:27] <DawnBat> Mordor city
[23:36:20] <DawnBat> the Desire Realms would be just about anything you want.
[23:36:35] <DawnBat> in such a manner that you become lost. Never want to leave
[23:37:08] <Iona> Make an ice palace please.
[23:37:26] <DawnBat> those would be in Tartarus or Cruelty
[23:37:48] <DawnBat> probably Cruelty
[23:38:02] <DawnBat> Tartarus is the lowest point of The Inner Realms
[23:38:50] <DawnBat> Cruelty would be a Higher Realm
[23:38:59] <DawnBat> a realm of ice and crystal
[23:40:01] <DawnBat> I should make Mermaids as a type of Lust Demon
[23:40:53] <DawnBat> Iona: Would you like to be the Queen of Cruelty? :P
[23:41:43] <Iona> Why, who needs punishing?
[23:41:51] <DawnBat> souls
[23:41:59] <DawnBat> the ones who were cruel in life.
[23:42:02] <DawnBat> like Hitler.
[23:42:39] <North> George Clooney, also
[23:42:46] <North> because, man, does that guy ever suck at acting
[23:42:53] <DawnBat> Nah
[23:42:55] <Iona> Why, are you a soul that needs punishment?
[23:42:59] <DawnBat> No o-o
[23:43:08] <DawnBat> you just wanted an ice palace sooo
[23:44:14] *** Iona is now known as I-own-a-Pun-isher
