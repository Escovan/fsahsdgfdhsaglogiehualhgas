[04:34:16] <MissSugar> and a tarot deck 
[04:35:14] <Spiceboi> this is good news.
[04:35:27] <Spiceboi> today i wrote a three page document about magic.
[04:35:30] <Spiceboi> went down well.
[04:35:36] <MissSugar> sweet
[04:35:46] <MissSugar> what about?
[04:35:57] <Spiceboi> well, i listed all my systems of magic.
[04:36:11] <Spiceboi> and the spheres they can be divided into so you know what blends with what.
[04:36:25] <Spiceboi> i practice right hand magic.
[04:36:26] <MissSugar> that sounds like a cool thesis
[04:36:39] <Spiceboi> :D
[04:37:22] <Spiceboi> can i run something by you?
[04:37:29] <Spiceboi> and see if you agree?

[04:37:37] <MissSugar> sure
[04:37:37] <Spiceboi> my other peers are out of socket at the moment.
[04:37:45] <Iona> MissSugar: which anime are you enjoying?
[04:37:58] <MissSugar> bakemonogatari
[04:38:03] <Spiceboi> well, i was thinking about how you get different telepathy channels,
[04:38:08] <Iona> ahhhh :)
[04:38:39] <Iona> Spiceboi: which telepathy channels have you identified?
[04:38:42] <Spiceboi> and discovered that this is simply the draw factor you have over the channels of communication.
[04:38:50] <Spiceboi> i have my own one!
[04:38:55] <Spiceboi> by the way...
[04:39:00] <Spiceboi> i cannot get into others though.
[04:39:31] <Spiceboi> due to your mental energy, you will attract others towards you, like gravity where you see small things collect around big things.
[04:39:40] <Spiceboi> as, i am big, i tell you.
[04:40:25] <Spiceboi> the main stay for our species though is 'devil channel.'
[04:40:46] <Spiceboi> this is the one that has held for centuries, as, this was the easiest way.
[04:40:59] <Spiceboi> so, my idea,
[04:41:19] <Spiceboi> do you think that if you were to look at telepathy like a plasma ball,
[04:41:37] <Spiceboi> you could identify that they are attracted to energy or stored energy or mass?
[04:42:00] <Spiceboi> this is all because i want some people off my channel.
[04:42:07] <Spiceboi> this guy named sam, for example.
[04:42:22] <Spiceboi> he just lies to me all day about stuff.
[04:42:26] <Spiceboi> impersonating others.
[04:42:47] <Iona> Spiceboi: perhaps that's one reason why people close their channels off?
[04:43:01] <Spiceboi> how do you do that?
[04:43:36] <Iona> Spiceboi: I would imagine the same way a child does?
[04:43:50] <Spiceboi> okay, how?
[04:43:53] <Iona> I'm hardly an expert :)
[04:43:59] <Spiceboi> close my eyes and hold my breath?
[04:44:02] <Iona> I'm just hypothesizing.
[04:44:04] <Spiceboi> :D okay.
[04:44:04] <MissSugar> i dont think i am picking up what you are putting down
[04:44:23] <Spiceboi> oh, pity, well, what is wrong with it?
[04:44:24] <MissSugar> are you talking about the energy that surrounds us that interconnects with other people
[04:44:32] <Spiceboi> auras.
[04:44:53] <MissSugar> ok
[04:44:58] <Spiceboi> if your aura is big enough, it attracts other smaller ones?
[04:45:03] <Spiceboi> like gravity?
[04:45:19] * AntleredGirl munches Easter eggies.
[04:45:27] <MissSugar> a friend of mine who was an empath use to visualize a wall of mirrors surrounding her to block out unwanted energy
[04:45:41] <MissSugar> through that she was able to control what came into her space
[04:45:42] <Spiceboi> facing outwards?
[04:45:45] <MissSugar> yeah 
[04:45:49] <Spiceboi> lol okay obviously.
[04:46:26] <Spiceboi> okay thanks. maybe when i lie in bed trying to talk to my children i can actually get past this sam guy now?
[04:46:46] <Iona> Spiceboi: maybe if you focus on what your own experience is...
[04:47:11] <Spiceboi> okay, i am lost now.
[04:47:24] <Iona> what is telepathy?
[04:47:54] <Iona> (Explain it like I'm 5, please)
[04:49:27] <Spiceboi> telepathy. this is where you make a sound in your mind, which goes to the throat and voice box, subtly makes vibrations in the air around you called 'sound waves.' this is picked up by greatly underestimated hairs in your ear, which sense the vibrations and due to the shape of them, affect each hair in different areas, sending an impression to the brain. voila that is telepathy. no magic hocus pocus god did it stuff.
[04:50:12] <Spiceboi> would you like to know what hell and heaven is?
[04:50:39] <Iona> No, Spiceboi.  I'll leave that to those who want to live in either.
[04:50:46] <Spiceboi> unless you do not understand or agree with my telepathy thing.
[04:50:54] <Spiceboi> okay. :D
[04:51:08] <Iona> I don't have to agree, I want a simple explanation, so that perhaps you can answer your own difficulty...
[04:51:18] <Spiceboi> oh cool man.
[04:51:23] <Spiceboi> okay...
[04:51:27] <Spiceboi> erm...
[04:51:44] <Spiceboi> the problem is that sam has devil charms on him to bypass my blocks.
[04:51:49] <AntleredGirl> I'm so lost. 
[04:51:53] <Spiceboi> these are magic that i cannot overcome.

[05:05:42] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It seems to me that what he described as telepathy is just normal speaking.
[05:05:45] <Iona> on how many levels, MissSugar ?
[05:05:57] <Iona> ArchrWndrMcRbrt: I agree, there's a lack of clarity...  
[05:06:06] <MissSugar> in a dream maybe this happened
[05:06:45] <Iona> Ahhh...  
[05:07:04] <tomorrowgirl> hi
[05:07:20] <MissSugar> hey tomorrowgirl 
[05:07:27] <tomorrowgirl> hi MissSugar 
[05:07:30] <Iona> MissSugar: it's interesting experiencing things twice, isn't it?
[05:07:44] <Iona> Maybe there's something insistent about the experience...
[05:08:04] <MissSugar> i usually frustrate myself trying to find signifigance 
[05:09:32] <Iona> To me, telepathy = perception (and communication) beyond perceptions - not sight, sound, taste, etc, but by the mind alone.
[05:10:00] <Iona> *5 sense perceptions

[20:04:35] <Quad> hey hraf
[20:04:52] <OddlyGentle> Hello Quad
[20:05:07] <Quad> nd oddly
[20:05:15] <Quad> and*
[20:05:51] <Quad> Hrafnbjorn: what can you tell me about valkeries
[20:06:10] <Hrafnbjorn> what would ya like to know?
[20:06:31] <Hrafnbjorn> it is a somewhat well documented aspect, but also complex
[20:06:57] <Quad> i'm unning comparison between them and angels
[20:07:36] <Quad> actually, i'm comparing all kinds of similar creatures in lores to angels
[20:07:53] <Hrafnbjorn> well, a valkyrie's one and only job is to fetch souls of the battle fallen... there is also another aspect, which is part of a males soul, and is somewhat like a guardian angle
[20:07:58] *** Joins: SpiritSong2 (Dreaming@sorcery-7sq.vrk.189.91.IP)
[20:08:00] <Abraxas> Welcome, SpiritSong2. Only one thing registers on the subconscious mind: repetitive application. Practice. What you practice is what you manifest.
[20:08:50] <Hrafnbjorn> the valkyrie, as a being, is implied to be tied to the Vanic deities, and so may therefore be an evolution of the female soul
[20:09:31] <Quad> odd
[20:10:12] <Quad> angels are often pictured as feminine, but are mostly depicted as male
[20:10:12] <Hrafnbjorn> ?
[20:10:43] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, angels are genderless in the lore though
[20:10:52] <Quad> so why the similarity in discription?
[20:10:59] <Quad> not true
[20:11:17] <Quad> angels have gender as according to genesis
[20:11:37] <Quad> how else did we get nephalim?
[20:12:07] <Hrafnbjorn> in the late period one, yes, in early Jewish texts they can be either gender, or no gender at all
[20:12:09] <Quad> or shall i call them "mighty men"
[20:12:33] <Quad> it's thought that they are perfect hermahradites
[20:12:40] <OddlyGentle> actually I have to correct you
[20:13:01] <Quad> ok
[20:13:04] <OddlyGentle> Angels are poly-morphic
[20:13:21] <Quad> no text supports that theory
[20:13:25] <OddlyGentle> they change physical aspects based on what they want
[20:13:59] <Quad> unless you are pulling some enochian text out
[20:14:28] <OddlyGentle> actually it's further into the Old Testament
[20:14:43] <Quad> give me a verse
[20:15:08] <Hrafnbjorn> the similarity in description may be related to proto-Indo-European philosophy, in which there was a belief in guardian or attendant beings related to specific family lines.  In the Caananite lands there was far more cultural interaction than in the pure Indo-European lands, so the Jewish versions refelct the Indo-European, Proto-Persian, and Dravidian... then Arabic (which is where the mono-theism comes)
[20:15:47] <Quad> so the descriptions are just addaptations?
[20:16:17] <Quad> any pre-canaan scripts survive?
[20:16:21] <Hrafnbjorn> perhaps... the descriptions change over time, and according to cultural interactions
[20:17:02] <OddlyGentle> well firstly I must state that that if you dig into the bible at all, unless a name or very specific individual significance is assigned, any group of men and/ or women is always referred to as men
[20:17:16] <Quad> true
[20:17:46] <Quad> i said interactions are often male, most prominent angels have male names
[20:17:56] <OddlyGentle> even when women are in the group
[20:18:06] <Hrafnbjorn> there is a tablet from Yh that discusses their patron god Ywh, and that there were 3 Canaanite men that fled Egypt, and stayed there, and took on their mono-theistic god... which they took back to Canaanite lands, which formed the mono-theistic Judaism.... but reality is that it would stay dual theistic until the reign of David
[20:18:16] <Quad> so, i didn't say they are all male, but rather depicted as male
[20:19:16] <Quad> dual theistic until david, that is interesting
[20:19:17] <OddlyGentle> as far as names being male: the prominent use of angelic names is in the imperial sense
[20:19:38] <Hrafnbjorn> thir 'names' also designate them as gods themselves (the -el suffix designated deity in old hebrew)
[20:19:50] <Quad> i'm not being sexist to the angels, i promise
[20:20:20] <OddlyGentle> male feels given to names to indicate not a specific gender but rather no gender at all in particular
[20:20:51] <Quad> until they make nephilem with human women
[20:21:07] <Hrafnbjorn> I have always taken mythic beings, whether angel, giant, Aesir, whatever to be less bound by gender than non-mythic beings... in mythologies form all over the world gender is very fluid, and the farther east and south you go, the more common, and more feminine it becomes
[20:21:16] <OddlyGentle> like calling a girl named Joanne "Jo" in front of people who don't know her
[20:21:53] <OddlyGentle> when she makes a lot of..... "special" ..... jokes
[20:22:23] <Quad> i'm not saying that there aren't female angels, only that they are often depicted as male
[20:22:46] <Quad> with male attributes
[20:23:36] <Quad> i highly doubt that gender is a problem, just they are considered masculin

[20:25:01] <Hrafnbjorn> I wonder if Ywh's famale counterpart, Asheram was seen more as angelic, or full blown deity.  What we can tell is that she was treated as full deity by females... but theres no historical evidence of any male sects, or devotion to her, so when seeing the society in big picture, its hard to say if she was an equal, lesser, or other type deity

[20:27:11] <Hrafnbjorn> Yaweh
[20:27:28] <Quad> thought so
[20:27:56] <Hrafnbjorn> the Arabic town the patron originated (Yh) is pronounced Yawa
[20:28:04] <Quad> what do the old texts say about ywh?
[20:28:17] <Quad> pre-jew
[20:29:03] <Hrafnbjorn> I dont know as far as the Hebrew side, the Arabic side says he was a war god, a god of civil authority, and a god or ressurection

[20:31:23] <Quad> and i assume he was a major diety?
[20:31:32] <Hrafnbjorn> just how much changed between the Arabic, and Hebrew versions is harder to say... when we have prrof of the dual deity of David's time, the Greeks were just starting to exert their power in mid east, and Thracian power was lessening, so where and how those effected Hebrew lore is hard to say
[20:32:01] <Hrafnbjorn> yes Ywh is the god of Abraham, and the one loeft in Abrahamic faiths
[20:32:29] <Quad> yeah, and ressurection

[20:37:56] <Quad> ok, but it has alot to do with how we understand it,
[20:38:10] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed
[20:39:01] <Quad> so what other gods would be in that particular set of deities?
[20:40:49] <Hrafnbjorn> other than Ywh and Asheram, I have no clue
[20:41:56] <Quad> so asheram is just the female counterpart?
[20:43:22] <Hrafnbjorn> hard to say... what we know about her comes from the artifact record, so we dont know about the spirituality involved, just that she was wide-spread, worshipped by females, and then during David's time the civic authority lashed out against the women that worshipped her

[21:05:55] <DawnBat> the guy who played Viktor Krum in Harry Potter, omfg.
[21:05:59] <DawnBat> him today
[21:06:30] <DawnBat> his name is Stanislav Ianevski
[21:07:14] <Hrafnbjorn> anyone have topic idea?
[21:07:27] <DawnBat> Santa Claus
[21:07:29] <DawnBat> :P
[21:08:09] <DawnBat> If you want I can recite phrases from various Kemetic texts
[21:08:17] <DawnBat> in the original Egyptian language
[21:08:20] <Quad> auditory hallucinations
[21:08:33] <DawnBat> Quad: Those are freaky
[21:08:48] <Quad> he said topic ideas
[21:08:59] <Quad> not kosher topic ideas
[21:09:14] <DawnBat> I'm saying they're a freaky occurence
[21:10:15] <Quad> tell them to shut it
[21:10:33] <DawnBat> Imma slap all these demosn
[21:10:35] <Hrafnbjorn> typicaly auditory hallucinations are the most common, however I get more visual than auditory, but thats only cause of poor eyes
[21:10:42] <Quad> or get a restraining order on the voices in your head
[21:11:11] <DawnBat> it's all the absinthe Hrafnbjorn ;)
[21:11:34] <Hrafnbjorn> I have hallucinated gun shots (sounds) though, so there is that exception
[21:11:40] <Quad> bad eyes make visual hallucinations more likely
[21:12:03] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[21:12:10] <Quad> so does damage to the optic nerves
[21:12:49] <Quad> but it becomes a full on episode when they combine
[21:12:49] <DawnBat> unffff
[21:12:51] <Hrafnbjorn> my left eye has damaged nerve, but Icould not honestky say if the hallucinations are from that, or from astygmatism
[21:12:53] <DawnBat> Geralt Of Rivia <3
[21:13:16] <Quad> astigmatism causes refrations
[21:13:24] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[21:13:31] <Quad> the nerve could add to it
[21:14:15] <Quad> get off the witcher
[21:14:36] <DawnBat> Quad: Why
[21:15:08] <Hrafnbjorn> I thought the Witcher games were a bit terrible
[21:15:10] <Quad> he has enough complicated relationships
[21:15:24] <Quad> i love them
[21:15:31] <Quad> the lore sucks
[21:15:41] <DawnBat> how so
[21:15:50] <Quad> but it's nice to have a game for a mature audience
[21:16:18] <Hrafnbjorn> I just like a bit more option in PRG's... the Witcher games seem to dictated
[21:16:47] <DawnBat> it's not the most open, I have only played the first though.

[22:17:48] <Hrafnbjorn> do you have any idea how frustrating it is to try to look for good research materials on longbows?  A google search just comes back with a bunch of SCA crap, and nothing useful, lol
[22:18:12] <Quad> do your own research
[22:18:36] <Quad> or are we talking about history
[22:18:48] <Hrafnbjorn> I am... I am speaking of history, and development
[22:19:08] <Quad> ok, you have to be more specific
[22:19:24] <Quad> types of longbows
[22:19:56] <Hrafnbjorn> I have several pieces of wood I was gonna try to carve into longbow, so I was trying to get info on which part of branch to use for 'D' stave, or flat stave bows, and if specific woods are better for one or the other
[22:20:46] <Quad> oh, this i can discuss, what woods are you thinking
[22:21:07] <Quad> i like the idea of yew
[22:21:11] <Hrafnbjorn> I have ash and oak right now... I can get crepe myrtle as well
[22:21:25] <Hrafnbjorn> I would love to make one out of yew, but no yew grows around here
[22:21:40] <Quad> ash
[22:22:02] <Hrafnbjorn> I think ash has to be the flat stave style
[22:22:11] <Hrafnbjorn> I just dont remember where I read that
[22:22:14] <Quad> has plenty of flex so if you want somthing with a medium draw
[22:22:43] <Quad> you can have a rounded ash
[22:22:57] <Quad> it's prefered in flat
[22:23:18] <Hrafnbjorn> have you ever watched a youtube channel called the Backyard Bowyer?  I like his pvc bows for practical combat archery practice, cause they are cheap and weak
[22:23:23] <Quad> what type of oak?
[22:23:31] <Hrafnbjorn> practice like archery tag, etc
[22:23:38] <Hrafnbjorn> it is pinoak
[22:24:02] <Hrafnbjorn> hard to find straight enough pieces, but I have 2 peices of oak that are straight enough
[22:24:03] <Quad> that would be good with a light draw, maybe a thick birch
[22:24:45] <Quad> pinoak is stiff
[22:24:51] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah
[22:25:02] <Quad> it'll have to be treated just right
[22:25:26] <Quad> lso dangerous for things like archery tag
[22:25:56] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, I wouldnt use a good bow for archery tag
[22:25:59] <Quad> but if you wanna hunt large game, oak would be my choice
[22:26:12] <Quad> how old?
[22:26:36] <Hrafnbjorn> the oak has been se3asoning for 3 years now
[22:26:41] <Hrafnbjorn> *seasoning
[22:26:52] <Hrafnbjorn> no clue how old the tree was originaly
[22:27:24] <Quad> hmm, probly a bit of play in then
[22:28:10] <Quad> i have done a bit of research on this
[22:28:26] <Hrafnbjorn> I just want something a little weaker than my compound cause if I miss the target with it, I loose the arrow, lol
[22:28:46] <Quad> i know that feeling
[22:29:14] <Quad> but longbows shoot completely different than compounds
[22:29:22] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[22:29:28] <Quad> it's a different disapline
[22:29:35] <Quad> altogether
[22:30:15] <Hrafnbjorn> as is combat archery vs. target or hunting
[22:30:50] <Quad> you should be good at combat archery before you go hunting
[22:31:05] <Quad> lots things with teeth
[22:31:41] <Quad> or, carry a side arm
[22:31:47] <Hrafnbjorn> I have only studied Japanese and Mongolian style for the combat archery... neither are totaly practical for MY life though
[22:32:10] <Quad> nor will they be
[22:32:31] <Quad> different times, different needs
[22:32:39] <Hrafnbjorn> Mongolian style involves horses, which I dont have... Japanese style is specific to a bow geometry, and I dont have that type of bow
[22:33:10] <Quad> k, so go more kings and castles
[22:34:38] <Quad> ever hear of lars anderson?
[22:34:44] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah
[22:35:00] <Quad> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEG-ly9tQGk
[22:35:14] <Hrafnbjorn> cant watch youtube til I go to work
[22:35:21] <Quad> dang
[22:36:02] <Hrafnbjorn> he was involved in the experimental archealogy study in southern calif. studying medieval weapons
[22:36:04] <Quad> well, as a martial artist, you should be capable of extrapilating from styles
[22:36:37] <Quad> he is also badass with a bow
[22:37:11] <Quad> specifically longbows
[22:37:51] * Hrafnbjorn nods... that was his contribution to the study... him, and Mike Loades covered the Euro, and north Asian bows and style... I forget who handled the south Asian, and North American ones
[22:38:20] <Quad> unfortunately, we can't carry bows around on the street
[22:38:37] <Quad> otherwise, he'd scare the crap outta me
[22:38:48] <Hrafnbjorn> I wouldnt want to use one in cambat anyway, I just love the study
[22:38:55] <Hrafnbjorn> *combat
[22:40:00] <Quad> oh, plz, no1 would screw with you if they saw their friend with a 36inch pole sticking from their gut
[22:41:09] <Quad> mastered, that level would be as effective as a small concealed firearm
[22:41:11] <Hrafnbjorn> that is true, bow just requires certain specifics that dont exist in how I would be fighting now... a crossbow is still useful because its a whole different light
[22:41:46] <Quad> crossbows don't account for ltiple enemies
[22:41:54] <Hrafnbjorn> the issue with a bow is that if the person knows ya are gonna shoot, its too easy to dodge
[22:41:54] <Quad> multiple*
[22:42:22] <Quad> longbows don't work that way
[22:42:32] <Quad> can't just draw and aim
[22:42:48] <Hrafnbjorn> even old texts state that once your enemy is close enough to see the arrow, ya need to discard the bow
[22:42:53] <Quad> you have to already have aimed before you drew
[22:43:28] <Quad> yeah, wonder if that actually applies to ppl like lars
[22:43:36] <Quad> doubt it
[22:43:39] <Hrafnbjorn> I would love to see someone try to draw and hold a traditional longbow... just drawing it is a rare skill now
[22:44:16] <Quad> which means you have to already know the trajectory before hand
[22:44:19] <Hrafnbjorn> I can see that if ya can fire as quickly as he does, it would increase its effectiveness cause you can fire so multiple arrows hot at same time
[22:44:34] <Hrafnbjorn> *hit
[22:44:54] <Quad> my point is based off his level
[22:45:14] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[22:45:48] <Quad> and since back then they didn't have the conveiniences we have know, his level, as probly more common than we suspect
[22:45:59] <Quad> was*
[22:46:14] <Hrafnbjorn> the issue with the bow as a 1 on 1 weapon isnt accuracy, or lethality, it is the size of the arrow.  Because it is big enough to see it in flight, it makes it too easy to dodge or block
[22:46:47] <Quad> not if the arrow is used as a knife
[22:47:13] <Quad> then 1 on 1 hand to hand is much more practical
[22:47:33] <Hrafnbjorn> ah, yes but then its not an archery thing anymore
[22:47:46] <Quad> no
[22:48:10] <Quad> but it's still an implication of the same weapon system
[22:48:17] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[22:48:19] <Quad> application
[22:48:40] <Quad> anything is a weapon
[22:49:52] <Quad> no matter how advanced we get, sometimes it still comes down to sticks and stones
[22:52:06] <Hrafnbjorn> when you study both the tools of the trade, as well as the strategies regarding weapon systems and deployment, it becomes pretty clear that we still havent really added much, the shape of the tool has changed, but it all still comes down to pointy, edged, blunt/mass, thrown, or shot... even the strategies have not changed much at all.  Aircraft include the conlfagation theories which didnt exist in the past, but otherwise we are still usin
[22:52:13] <Hrafnbjorn> same general principals

[22:52:14] <Abraxas> Welcome, DawnBat. Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about.
[22:52:18] <Hrafnbjorn> wb DawnBat
[22:52:25] <DawnBat> thanks
[22:52:40] <Hrafnbjorn> the bow became artilary, the crossbow became the rifle, etc...
[22:52:49] <DawnBat> mmm crossbows
[22:52:57] <Hrafnbjorn> spear became the bayonette
[22:53:33] <Quad> well the bow became the rifle, and seige weapons became artillery
[22:53:47] <Hrafnbjorn> not in usage
[22:53:53] <Quad> spear is always my fave
[22:53:57] <Hrafnbjorn> bow has to come from above to be useful
[22:54:11] <Quad> no
[22:54:26] <Hrafnbjorn> so being indirect fire, it is most like artilary, where the main goal is denial of ground
[22:54:47] <Quad> bow came from above because there were sheilds on the front lines
[22:54:47] <Hrafnbjorn> if the arrow from a bow comes from straight ahead its not effective
[22:54:58] <Quad> even a bullet curves
[22:55:10] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, but you cant see the bullet
[22:55:29] <Hrafnbjorn> again that effectiveness isnt about lethality, it is about the defense against it
[22:55:31] <Quad> same principle
[22:56:07] <Hrafnbjorn> the reason why the bow was almost always shot so the arrow came down on target was to avoid them simply stepping to the side, or putting a shild up
[22:56:14] <Hrafnbjorn> *sheild
[22:56:18] <Quad> how does a sniper shoot 1800 meters?

[22:56:29] <DawnBat> SpiritSong2: :D
[22:56:58] <Hrafnbjorn> not by using indirect fire... yes it curves, but its still not indirect fore
[22:57:07] <Hrafnbjorn> wb SpiritSong2
[22:57:10] <Quad> it is indirect
[22:57:17] <Quad> very muchly so
[22:57:37] <Hrafnbjorn> its not because it is aimed... indirect fire is estimated, but not aimed
[22:57:38] <Quad> because the sniper doesn't aim where he intends to hit
[22:57:49] <Quad> making it indirect
[22:57:57] <Hrafnbjorn> not true
[22:58:28] <Hrafnbjorn> sniper fire is still considered indirect because there is a target... indirect fire focuses on area, not target
[22:58:33] <Quad> at that distance the bullet is aimed above the intended point
[22:58:37] <Hrafnbjorn> condiered direct, sorry
[22:58:57] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, but you adjust the scope so you are still aiming at target
[22:59:11] <Quad> indirect fire means it's not aimed at the iontended target
[22:59:14] <Hrafnbjorn> if ya did not, at that range the target would not even be in your firled of view

[23:00:12] <Hrafnbjorn> right, and snipers (when used as shooters) still fire at the target, they just have to adjust up (same for shooting downward, ya have to shoot high) but the scope is adjusted so you still aim the same way
[23:00:16] <Quad> so, because the target is in view it's direct?
[23:00:37] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, because you are targeting something, instead of an area, it is direct
[23:01:07] <Quad> ok, so lets apply this principle to a howitzer
[23:01:12] <Hrafnbjorn> the bow, used in combat, was not aimed at a target, it was aimed to fall in a region of space whether there is a target there or not
[23:01:43] <Quad> tell that to deer and those close battles
[23:02:15] <Hrafnbjorn> bow was not used for close battles, except by Mongolians, which was a totaly different concept

[23:03:00] <DawnBat> oh look a dragon
[23:03:05] * DawnBat grabs the torches and pitchforks
[23:03:47] <Quad> yeah, they were so aimed at targets
[23:03:52] <Hrafnbjorn> the bow used by mongolians was deployed by circling the host army, and firing into the group.  It was also highly ineffective against organized combatants
[23:04:15] <Hrafnbjorn> they were not aimed at targets, they were aimed at a region
[23:04:31] <DawnBat> Hrafnbjorn: How about dem Scythian archers
[23:04:56] <Quad> they aimed at targets, artillery is aimed at targets, rifles are aimed at targets
[23:05:08] <WickedDragon> Merry meet Hrafnbjorn 
[23:05:47] <Hrafnbjorn> the Mongolian claim to fame was to out manuvour the host, and fire so many arrows at them that some would get through.  They wouldnt aim at the targets because they were moving too fast, and by the time they picked a target, it was moving behind them
[23:05:52] <OddlyGentle> Hello all
[23:06:00] <Hrafnbjorn> I think we are using a totaly diffent idea for 'aim'
[23:06:11] <Quad> just because the rounds travel differently, doesn't mean it isn't aimed at something
[23:06:35] <WickedDragon> Merry meet OddlyGentle 
[23:07:04] <Quad> just because the round isn't pointed at the target, doesn't mean it isn't aimed
[23:07:04] <OddlyGentle> Dremkotinhi WickedDragon
[23:07:25] <DawnBat> OddlyGentle: WAT
[23:07:43] <OddlyGentle> literally: peace towards you
[23:07:49] <DawnBat> in what language xD
[23:07:54] <Quad> just like the sniper
[23:08:07] <Hrafnbjorn> its not a matter of how the round fires, its strategy... an arrow shot at a person has little chance of success, which is why they were fired to come down from above... artilary, while it CAN be fired horizontaly is ineffective compared to comeing down... different reason for the indirect fire, but indirect none the less
[23:08:36] <Quad> indirect fire is still aimed fire
[23:08:54] <OddlyGentle> Dovahzul but it is constructed of three words to make a single "namaste" type of greeting
[23:09:00] <Hrafnbjorn> it is not aimed at a target though, it is aimed at a region
[23:09:14] <Quad> no, it's aimed at a target
[23:09:18] <WickedDragon> That reminds me of skyrim, dovah
[23:09:32] <DawnBat> Dovahzul is
[23:09:40] <DawnBat> And that's not canon Dovahzul
[23:09:57] <OddlyGentle> the parts are
[23:10:11] <Hrafnbjorn> only recently have we had guided artilary, before recently, it was always aimed to hit a region, because more often than not the individual targets could not be relayed
[23:10:37] <DawnBat> iffy at most. The language wasn't fully developed. It's in the back of the Legendary Edition guide..Not too many there.
[23:10:58] <DawnBat> phrases are feasible. Whole sentences no :p
[23:11:02] <Quad> through the art of a forward observer it can be aimed
[23:11:02] <WickedDragon> I think the target here is the region, the other target would be an indivudual target, a single target. I guess? 
[23:11:27] <OddlyGentle> thuum.org for cannon
[23:11:28] <Quad> and it has a long algorithm to do so
[23:11:38] <DawnBat> OddlyGentle: that's not canon.
[23:11:46] <WickedDragon> Thuum, shout
[23:11:48] <OddlyGentle> yes it is
[23:11:54] <DawnBat> how so?
[23:11:56] <Hrafnbjorn> that snopt aimed, the FO can only give a target 5 meters in diameter, however if a FO is used, it is indirect fire 
[23:12:08] <Hrafnbjorn> yes WickedDragon
[23:12:10] <Quad> the sniper uses a similar algorithm to aim at his target
[23:12:12] <OddlyGentle> they have an entire section just for cannon words
[23:12:18] <DawnBat> well yes that
[23:12:23] <DawnBat> but they do have a lot of fanon words.
[23:12:40] <OddlyGentle> no that is a different section
[23:12:48] <Quad> no the fo can give a target down to haf an inch
[23:12:52] <DawnBat> the most well developed TES language we have is Ayleidoon
[23:13:11] <Quad> and yes, we can hit that target
[23:13:24] <OddlyGentle> they have redone the entire site
[23:13:36] <DawnBat> fun
[23:13:38] <DawnBat> :D
[23:13:41] * DawnBat is a TES buff
[23:13:43] <Quad> we can even hit moving targets with artillery
[23:14:14] <DawnBat> in my own personal opinion is that fanon should only be used with the languages in rp
[23:14:49] <DawnBat> now if this was D&D it'd be different, it's weird but the D&D universes seem to be more....bendy
[23:15:09] <Quad> and if we can do it with bombs, they could do it with a target they could see using an indirect method
[23:15:11] <Hrafnbjorn> I am gonna bow out of this cause that was my exact duty for a log time, so I know full well its not down to 1/2 inch, lol
[23:15:24] <OddlyGentle> Well I used cannon words for my dragon namaste were all cannon
[23:15:28] <Quad> 13 series?
[23:15:39] <Quad> it's come a long way
[23:15:50] <DawnBat> why do you keep saying namaste?Just curio
[23:16:04] <Quad> my duty was processing that algorithm
[23:16:57] <Quad> fire direction, redleg for life
[23:17:26] <Hrafnbjorn> DawnBat, thats probably cause D&D doesnt focus on a universe like elder scrolls... there are some pre made stuff focused on Forgotten Realms, etc... but the game itself revolves around folk making their own worlds
[23:17:31] <OddlyGentle> namaste = peace to you = peace towards you = drem kotin hi =Dremkotinhi
[23:17:52] <DawnBat> Hrafnbjorn: TES was actually hevaily inspired by D&D as well.
[23:18:00] <DawnBat> it started out as a pen and paper.
[23:18:10] <Hrafnbjorn> of course, it just takes place in a specific world
[23:18:14] <OddlyGentle> It is my greeting now
[23:19:02] <DawnBat> Anywhoooo
[23:19:10] <DawnBat> To the North Pole!!!
[23:19:48] <DawnBat> ugh
[23:19:52] <DawnBat> I want ice cream
[23:20:11] <OddlyGentle> bbl
