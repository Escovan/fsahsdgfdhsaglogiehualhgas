[02:07:51] <Alyria> It was cake from a box. And frosting from a can.
[02:08:18] <North> hmm
[02:08:18] <Alyria> For eff sakes, it takes maybe five minutes more and minimal extra effort to make either from scratch.
[02:08:37] <North> but who has time for that, in these busy times
[02:09:19] <North> people's emails to ignore, Facebook things to Like
[02:09:21] <North> and so on
[02:10:06] <North> WillowOak, I have a question
[02:10:13] <WillowOak> ok
[02:10:14] <Alyria> hrmp.
[02:10:44] <North> were you planning to add any other self-aggrandizing titles to your nick, or just the aforementioned two?
[02:12:35] <WillowOak> I'm not trying to be anything I'm not
[02:12:48] <North> aha
[02:13:07] <North> both Lord and High Priest, then
[02:13:49] <WillowOak> whats wrong with that?
[02:15:35] <North> where to begin
[02:15:55] <WillowOak> I have a title..but I am not all about it :)
[02:16:39] <North> where does the 'Lord' one come from, if you don't mind me asking?
[02:18:24] <Alyria> My.
[02:18:32] <North> mm
[02:18:52] <MissSugar> i like M&M's too
[02:19:05] <WillowOak> sorry, phone rang. Lord is a title
[02:19:18] <North> 'mendems', as the little folk call them
[02:19:42] <MissSugar> so like faeries ?
[02:19:45] <Alyria> ;)
[02:19:56] <North> exactly
[02:20:02] <MissSugar> or are you referring simply to short people
[02:21:00] <WillowOak> Sorry, I just liked the name Lord to be in my chat name. It's not like I use it in my real life with my coven
[02:23:06] <WillowOak> some covens do use Lord and Lady to their High Priest and High Priestesses

[04:18:33] <Witchit> I worked SO HARD
[04:18:54] <North> very nice
[04:19:02] <Witchit> It's not the best picture because my room has like zero space XD
[04:19:17] <Witchit> And I have 2 commissions left
[04:19:47] <Witchit> I feel so bad for this person, he's going to have to pay so much money for all 3 commissions :P
[04:19:55] <XCuteWitchX> That's so cute!
[04:20:08] <North> yeah, I'm sure you feel just terrible
[04:20:22] <Witchit> Thanks! If you ever need a certain bag made I'm available :)
[04:20:35] <Witchit> Heheheh North, I actually do. Sort of. XD
[04:20:39] <North> ;)
[04:21:10] <Witchit> Nah, he's a friend of mine who's paid a lot before....I'm giving him a discount because he's paid SO MUCH over the year
[04:22:02] <Witchit> He wants a bag for his fiance, a bag for himself, and pixel art
[04:22:20] <North> a tall order
[04:22:28] <Witchit> I think the fabric is talking to me by now XD
[04:22:41] <North> always a good sign

[04:23:58] <North> a sound strategy
[04:23:59] <Witchit> But I'm ecstatic I'm getting this much attention, even if it's like four people :)
[04:24:27] <North> just in the nick of time

[04:24:56] <North> besides the commissions?
[04:25:00] <Witchit> Yeah :) I hope I can find a job asap, but for now I'm happy just doing commissions for now
[04:25:09] * North nods
[04:25:31] <Witchit> I have ONE MORE CLASS before I move into junior year
[04:25:56] <Witchit> A lot of pressure to finish my work before graduation, but I'm not scared at all :)
[04:26:05] <North> cause for celebration
[04:26:27] <Witchit> I've had so much support from so many people, I think college years are the best years of my life
[04:26:43] <North> nice to see some balance   :)
[04:27:35] <Witchit> Definitely :) Hopefully this happiness will keep up, as a lot of my friends are leaving college for bigger and better things
[04:28:05] <Witchit> But my boyfriend is also going to grad school here, so I can still see him
[04:28:19] <North> no small consideration

[04:47:10] <MissSugar> IT by Stephen King

[04:52:28] <North> I've got a bad feeling about this
[04:53:01] <MissSugar> my grampa would put it in our room every night we slept over and would say "charlie is watching you" and then we would lay there in fear arguing over who would take the doll out of the room, and it always ended up being me quickly putting the doll out side the room and closing the door and running back to bed
[04:53:05] <MissSugar> that thing was terrifying
[04:53:26] <North> child abuse   :(
[04:53:39] <SpiritSong> omh thats fecking terrifying

[22:16:35] <Raggiedmon> Hello
[22:17:21] <Darko> Hi, I'm new to this channel.
[22:18:34] <Raggiedmon> Welcome
[22:19:33] <Raggiedmon> it can be quiet for hours in this channel, but sometimes there is good conversation
[22:19:41] <Darko> Thanks, any magicians in here?
[22:20:08] <Raggiedmon> Ritual magick or slight of hand?
[22:20:16] <Darko> Ritual
[22:20:23] <Raggiedmon> I have done some
[22:20:43] <Darko> I study the hermetic quabbalah and the enochian system of John Dee.
[22:20:52] <Raggiedmon> ah
[22:21:19] <Raggiedmon> I have studied either less or more than I should have likly
[22:21:49] <Darko> Although I usually shun anything abrahamic with extreme prejudice.
[22:22:07] <Darko> I have a dislike of the hebrews.
[22:22:15] <Raggiedmon> Why?
[22:22:31] <Darko> Lets just say, its personal.
[22:22:37] <Raggiedmon> Ah
[22:22:52] <Darko> their parasitic nature is just one of many things that broke the camels back so to speak.
[22:23:14] <Raggiedmon> Ah
[22:24:02] <Darko> I am interested in Slavic paganism since there are not many sources on it I was able to find.
[22:24:24] <Raggiedmon> Afk tabacco
[22:24:38] <Darko> Alright.
[22:40:57] <Raggiedmon> Back
[22:41:18] <Darko> Welcome back.
[22:42:58] <Raggiedmon> Ty
[22:43:19] <Raggiedmon> I have a question, do you think all hebrew are bad or just a few?
[22:43:45] <Raggiedmon> I always had a problem being preduice knowing that the bad of a group are likly few per group
[22:45:37] <Darko> Do you know how egregores work?
[22:51:47] <Darko> I have yet to meet a jew who doesn't fall under the spell of his or her in-born nature.
[22:52:25] <Darko> Quite the opposite, there are quite a few I know that don't even realise that they posses the blood of jews.
[22:52:37] <Darko> Yet they quite peculiarly behave just the same.
[22:53:14] <SpiritSong> expression of hatred or prejustice for any group of people is not welcome here 
[22:53:32] <Raggiedmon> The way you put that I doubt it true but if it was sounds more like a curse on them than their in born nature
[22:53:47] <SpiritSong> we do have jewish chatters and chatters of many other faiths
[22:54:04] <Darko> I was asked, I answered.
[22:54:15] <Darko> I will gladly speak of other topics.
