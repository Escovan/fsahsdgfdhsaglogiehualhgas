[04:12:19] <North> sorry to hear    :/
[04:12:20] <DawnBat> that makes so much sense
[04:12:21] <Witchit> I'm still thinking about this dream I had last night
[04:12:38] <North> do tell, if you will
[04:12:38] <Witchit> It was like all my fears rolled into one, plus sleep paralysis
[04:12:58] <Witchit> I mean, it was so bad I was forced to use a method I knew gave me sleep paralysis
[04:12:59] <North> damn
[04:13:14] <Witchit> But I didn't care, I just wanted to get out of the dream

[04:19:59] * North shakes a fist in random directions, in case Technology happens to be looking
[04:20:25] <Witchit> Sorry about that, I think spirits really are in my house
[04:20:37] <Witchit> Hopefully they won't be too mean
[04:22:26] <Witchit> Anyone here? :)
[04:22:37] * North waves his dinner fork
[04:22:45] <Witchit> Cool, just making sure
[04:23:21] <North> if there are any spirits there, I predict full benevolence
[04:23:26] <North> in the spirit of balance
[04:23:41] <Witchit> Benevolence?
[04:23:48] <North> kindness
[04:24:03] <Witchit> I really, REALLY hope so
[04:24:16] <Witchit> A horrible nightmare and flickering lights isn't too hopeful
[04:25:00] <North> some things only seem to be associated
[04:25:39] <Witchit> I don't know, also the disconnection at certain times is also scary
[04:25:57] <North> annoying for you, certainly
[04:26:15] <North> although it doesn't seem to be an uncommon thing in irc, truth be told
[04:26:21] <Witchit> Yeah, but not as bad as the first time I ever used a ouija board
[04:26:28] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I gotta run for a bit, folks
[04:26:34] <SpiritSong> see ya archy
[04:26:37] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Take care and be well, all.

[04:26:44] <Witchit> Bye ArchrWndrMcRbrt!
[04:26:51] <Witchit> Shoot, just missed him
[04:27:10] <North> maybe time is a factor
[04:27:12] <SpiritSong> Witchit are you sure it wasn't sleep paralysis
[04:27:19] <North> you're usually here earlier, if memory serves
[04:27:33] <SpiritSong> sometimes you can "hallucinate" things when your body is asleep and mind is awake
[04:27:37] <SpiritSong> happens me A LOT
[04:27:50] <North> truth
[04:28:00] <SpiritSong> i saw my cat stiicking his paw through my closed door once for example
[04:28:29] <Witchit> SpiritSong: I knew I had sleep paralysis, and the lights flickering and disconnection of the computer is happenening now
[04:28:36] <Witchit> When I began to talk about the dream
[04:28:42] <SpiritSong> ahhh
[04:28:55] <Witchit> That's what's scaring me just a little.
[04:28:58] <SpiritSong> likley a coincidence hun
[04:29:03] <Witchit> Maybe :/
[04:29:08] * SpiritSong offers a hug
[04:29:08] <North> agreed
[04:29:14] <Witchit> -hugs back- :)
[04:29:18] <North> spooky when these things happen, though
[04:29:29] <SpiritSong> yeah totally i can understand why you are scared
[04:29:31] <Witchit> I've just dealt with spirits, so sometimes I get paranoid
[04:29:44] <SpiritSong> but truelly i bet its just a coincidence
[04:30:02] <Witchit> Possibly :)
[04:30:20] <Witchit> I might just leave a recorder by my door tonight just to make sure.
[04:30:20] <SpiritSong> :)
[04:30:33] <SpiritSong> if it makes you feel better
[04:30:35] <SpiritSong> :)
[04:30:41] <Witchit> I've caught whispers on tape before and ghostly figures
[04:30:56] <SpiritSong> on video?
[04:31:03] <Witchit> Video and audio
[04:31:18] <SpiritSong> ahhh
[04:31:39] <Witchit> It was really cool...it was the time when everyone was asleep
[04:32:05] <SpiritSong> sounds like it felt benevolent :)
[04:32:19] <Witchit> I don't know, my fascination for spirits knows no bounds :P
[04:32:41] <Witchit> It might as well be, SpiritSong!
[04:32:49] <SpiritSong> :D
[04:33:02] <North> <Witchit>  "My fascination with spirits knows no bounds."   <Liquor Store Clerk>  "You've come to the right place!"
[04:33:07] <Witchit> The scariest part about spirits though are the posessions
[04:33:14] <Witchit> Hahahaaha North XD
[04:33:28] <SpiritSong> they are very very rare though
[04:33:41] <Witchit> I've only had one possession in my entire life
[04:33:47] <Witchit> It was TERRIFYING
[04:33:53] <SpiritSong> i have no doubt
[04:34:32] <Witchit> I couldn't remember much, but bits and pieces are slowly recovering as time passes
[04:35:01] <SpiritSong> how do you feel about it now
[04:35:51] <Witchit> I feel awful that I said what I did at my psychologist's office, and when my entire personality changed I became very violent
[04:36:11] <Witchit> It made me stop exploring my psyche for a while
[04:36:27] <SpiritSong> sounds like a frightening time 
[04:36:28] <SpiritSong> ://
[04:37:00] <Witchit> Yeah. It's exactly what you'd think: ABSOLUTELY DO NOT MESS WITH EVIL BEINGS
[04:37:07] * North blames the complimentary juice boxes
[04:37:11] <Witchit> XD
[04:37:13] <North> ;)
[04:37:19] <Witchit> I can't believe you remember that
[04:37:26] <North> that makes two of us
[04:37:56] <Witchit> I was thirteen and a complete idiot when that happened
[04:38:12] <North> stuff happens
[04:38:20] * North gives an elaborate shrug
[04:38:21] <Witchit> I attempted using a ouija board for the first time with a friend
[04:38:31] <Witchit> Why do they sell those as TOYS?!
[04:38:48] <North> cause for wonder
[04:39:09] <MissSugar> because the chances of actually getting a random spirit through an ouija is really low
[04:39:19] <MissSugar> contacting the spirits is specific work
[04:39:40] <Witchit> I didn't know that MissSugar, when I used it twice I got responses both times :/
[04:40:53] <North> <Ouija Board Spirit>  "Hi! Caligula here!"   <TeenWitchit>  "Uh oh."
[04:41:00] <Witchit> Oh god XD
[04:41:42] <Witchit> I remember the scariest part of it. I said "What's your name?" "T-H-O-M-A-S" "Do you like me so far?" "NONONONO"
[04:42:38] <North> well, what does Thomas know
[04:42:41] * North scoffs
[04:42:55] <Witchit> Thomas wasn't the one who possessed me, but he was still pretty terrifying
[04:43:31] <Witchit> And I don't exactly know what Thomas knows :P After the triple knock on my door with no one there, that's when I stopped immediately
[04:43:50] <Witchit> I closed the portal and never did it again
[04:44:49] <SpiritSong> dont blame ya after that scare
[04:45:02] * North can't help but wonder if Witchit asked: "Thomas The Train?" before asking how he liked her so far
[04:45:21] <Witchit> XD No, I didn't North. That wouldn't really amuse him either
[04:45:45] <Witchit> I remember his details pretty well though
[04:46:00] <Witchit> Born in 1917, has 4 sisters and parents
[04:46:11] <Witchit> One named Adelaide
[04:46:41] <Witchit> He gave a lot of information, but never really wanted to tell me anything else
[04:47:40] <Witchit> The name Harvey keeps popping in my head right now, but I can't connect it to Thomas as much :/
[04:48:18] <North> <Witchit>  "Adelaide, right, fascinating...how about a winning lottery ticket number?"   ***silence***   <Witchit>  "All right, I'm hanging up now."
[04:48:34] <Witchit> Oh god, that would be so disrespectful XD
[04:48:39] <SpiritSong> its prolly your own harvey
[04:48:46] <SpiritSong> that has it in your head
[04:49:31] <SpiritSong> :)
[04:49:35] <Witchit> I'm wondering which Harvey I'm thinking of..
[04:49:44] <North> we were speaking of Harvey, just the other night
[04:50:02] <Witchit> Which Harvey are you talking about?
[04:50:02] <MissSugar> true sometimes we can create entities through constant thought
[04:50:10] <North> the movie one
[04:50:15] <SpiritSong> ^ thats true MissSugar
[04:50:20] <Witchit> The movie one? :/
[04:50:29] <North> featuring Jimmy Stewart
[04:50:36] <Witchit> Oh.
[04:50:49] <Witchit> No, I don't think it's a character in a movie XD
[04:50:59] <Witchit> That is true MissSugar
[04:51:23] <North> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_(film)
[04:51:27] <Witchit> I've always taken a fascination to whoever Harvey is
[04:51:46] <Witchit> I know that there have been children in dreams who have referred to me as Harvey
[04:52:11] <Witchit> North, it looks like a cute movie :)
[04:52:22] <SpiritSong> thats interesting
[04:52:26] <North> wouldn't mind revisiting that one
[04:52:36] <SpiritSong> children in my dreams call me "oh shit its the witch, run"
[04:52:39] <SpiritSong> :d
[04:52:40] <SpiritSong> :D
[04:52:43] <North> haha
[04:52:46] <Witchit> Awww
[04:52:59] <Witchit> That sucks, wish they could treat you with some respect :P
[04:53:19] <SpiritSong> they wil when i chae them on my ostrich mount
[04:53:24] <SpiritSong> chase
[04:53:31] <North> lol
[04:53:35] <Witchit> I've had a dream where I was burned at the stake for being a witch
[04:53:40] <Witchit> ....I don't like my dreams
[04:53:54] <North> nothing more respect-inspiring than an ostrich mount
[04:53:54] <SpiritSong> oh damn thats a distrassing one :/
[04:54:00] <SpiritSong> ikr North
[04:54:08] <Witchit> Only the ones who involve spirits I like

[06:58:58] <Hrafnbjorn> lets see... if left to me to make a topic, we will end up discussing runes
[06:58:59] * Emily ties Keith up with sea weed and light him in fire
[06:59:01] <AntleredGirl> What would you do, room, to consecrate a handfasting cord? 
[06:59:02] <SpiritSong> Hrafnbjorn, what goes behind the choice of wood you use in your woodburning. is there any correspondence to your choice of wood to the rune or symbols you enggrave?
[06:59:25] <Hrafnbjorn> it depdends on type of handfasting
[06:59:31] * Keith quickly rolls around and extinguishes the fire
[06:59:31] <AntleredGirl> I would love to see the variety and personality of everyone's answer.
[06:59:44] <AntleredGirl> If it depends, let's make a hypothetical situation
[06:59:58] <Keith> ummm... i dont believe in marriage......
[07:00:11] <AntleredGirl> say it's your handfasting, and you've personally made the cord, and you want to consecrate it or bless it in some way that is personal to you. 
[07:00:17] <Hrafnbjorn> if I had a choice, yes there is some correspondences, however at the moment I am limited to what I have growing, or bass wood boxes, since thats all I have access to
[07:00:26] <AntleredGirl> What would you do in that situation?

[16:48:37] <Witchit> I am here :P
[16:56:26] <Wolfbane> heya
[16:56:29] <Wolfbane> anyone here?
[16:56:40] <Witchit> I'm here!
[16:57:02] <Witchit> Sorry about the late reply, I'm still writing that story
[16:57:23] <Witchit> How are you? :)
[16:57:25] <Wolfbane> story?
[16:57:28] <Witchit> Oh
[16:57:37] <Wolfbane> im good actually
[16:57:38] <Witchit> I'm writing a story for my bf's graduation present
[16:57:42] <Wolfbane> im up all night
[16:57:49] <Wolfbane> was thinking about hitting the gym in the early hours
[16:57:58] <Wolfbane> oh i remember yah
[16:58:02] <Wolfbane> the pixel art chick
[16:58:09] <Witchit> Heheheh ^ ^"
[16:58:31] <Witchit> But yeah, that's really brave of you to use to gym
[16:58:45] <Witchit> I'm not overweight, but unhealthy enough to feel self-conscious
[16:58:54] <Witchit> (Well, slightly overweight)
[16:58:57] <Wolfbane> i probably won't go this morning
[16:59:02] <Wolfbane> thinking more about getting drunk haha
[16:59:08] <Witchit> Awww, don't do that > <
[16:59:22] <Witchit> Hit the gym and have fun, it's probably healthier :)
[16:59:29] <Wolfbane> when people think what you mean by getting drunk i wonder
[16:59:50] <Witchit> Well I wouldn't know, I'm not really around alcohol too much

[17:00:04] <Witchit> Considering my medication converts it to poison :P
[17:00:06] <Wolfbane> well i don't wanna get that bent outta shape that im throwing up if thats what you think :)
[17:00:23] <Wolfbane> and damn
[17:00:26] <Wolfbane> thats a bummer
[17:00:32] <Witchit> Nah, it's all good :)
[17:00:55] <Witchit> I don't mind being a boring white chick XD
[17:01:22] <Witchit> Considering the most exotic thing I've drank before is a frappachino with no caffeine
[17:01:36] <Wolfbane> ahh ok
[17:01:39] <Wolfbane> gotcha :\
[17:01:47] <Wolfbane> im far from a boring white guy
[17:02:07] <Witchit> That's great, live on the edge :) Just don't go too far off if you know what I mean
[17:02:37] <Witchit> Sky diving isn't exactly fun without a parachute
[17:02:55] <Wolfbane> uhm
[17:03:01] <Wolfbane> i wasn't saying im into extreme sports
[17:03:04] <Wolfbane> but yea
[17:03:10] <Wolfbane> im an interesting person
[17:03:11] <Witchit> It was a metaphor :/
[17:03:24] <Wolfbane> i recognized :)
[17:03:32] <Witchit> Ah, gotcha
[17:03:41] <Wolfbane> yes
[17:03:41] <Witchit> That's great!
[17:03:47] <Witchit> Tell me more about yourself ^ ^
[17:03:48] <Wolfbane> :\
[17:03:55] <Wolfbane> hmm
[17:04:00] <Wolfbane> well i gym, i skydive
[17:04:09] <Wolfbane> i climb cliffs
[17:04:10] <Wolfbane> jokes
[17:04:24] <Witchit> I was about to say "I don't do extreme sports" XD
[17:04:26] <Wolfbane> nah i write music..
[17:04:33] <Wolfbane> which in itself can be extreme
[17:04:38] <Wolfbane> as the lifestyle usually is
[17:05:07] <Witchit> Yeah, my bf is a pianist :) I can also sing to his tunes, so I can tell how thrilling it is
[17:05:09] <Wolfbane> i read, watch movies... heaps of those, not so much on em anymore
[17:05:16] <Wolfbane> but i like going to clubs
[17:05:27] <Wolfbane> sometimes i go by myself and just take in the atmosphere
[17:05:48] <Wolfbane> pubs mainly
[17:05:52] <Wolfbane> not nightclubs
[17:05:52] <Witchit> I've never been to a club :/ It doesn't really sound like a good time when people describe it
[17:05:56] <Witchit> Oh, good
[17:06:10] <Witchit> I think pubs are more colorful
[17:06:10] <Wolfbane> i like a good drop
[17:06:16] <Wolfbane> that they are
[17:06:21] <Wolfbane> as are the characters you find in them
[17:06:27] <Witchit> Exactly
[17:06:44] <Witchit> Though I never drink, it's always fun to have a nice chat :)
[17:06:50] <Wolfbane> yea
[17:06:56] <Wolfbane> thats the idea behind drinking
[17:07:00] <Wolfbane> social lubricant
[17:07:09] <Witchit> Well, sometimes
[17:07:23] <Witchit> I've been to more than one college party if you know what I'm sayin XP
[17:07:24] <Wolfbane> alcohol just loosens you up, makes you more relaxed
[17:07:28] <Wolfbane> ok
[17:07:43] <Wolfbane> yea... colleges... sorry but im about to rant
[17:07:52] <Witchit> Go right ahead
[17:08:00] <Wolfbane> i hate those little elitist punks who go to college parties
[17:08:04] <Wolfbane> not all of em are
[17:08:11] <Wolfbane> but the majority
[17:08:40] <Witchit> Yeah, I know the feeling. Being a junior in college, I try my best not to go, but I get roped in sometimes by peer pressure
[17:08:59] <Witchit> I have a great circle of friends, but sometimes they're connected to idiots
[17:09:17] <Wolfbane> oh ive met all types of pricks at pubs through friends and stuff
[17:09:29] <Wolfbane> some of the stuff those people have the hide to say
[17:10:18] <Wolfbane> i don't mind if someone says something to me ... as soon as they lay a hand on me, its on like donkey kong
[17:10:33] <Witchit> Yeah....at least my friends are responsible drinkers, some of them freshmen who don't even drink. There was a point where a drunk girl gave her keys to her best friend so she wouldn't be tempted to drive
[17:10:53] <Wolfbane> ok
[17:10:54] <Wolfbane> yea
[17:10:58] <Wolfbane> thats ok i guess
[17:10:59] <Wolfbane> not all are
[17:11:12] <Wolfbane> i'd rather be a loner
[17:11:19] <Wolfbane> people aren't my thing so much anymore
[17:11:26] <Witchit> Well you at least have one friend online ^ ^
[17:11:31] <Wolfbane> aww thanks Witchit 
[17:11:49] <Witchit> You can come on here as much as you want, we're here to share the anti-social feels :P
[17:12:04] <Wolfbane> i'd say im a social person

[17:12:44] <Witchit> Welcome June!
[17:12:49] <June> mm
[17:12:53] <Witchit> We're talking about being social :)
[17:13:15] <June> ah yes, ty Witcit, and hello x
[17:13:36] <June> *Wutchit, sorry for mispelling
[17:13:42] <June> *Witchit
[17:13:46] <June> omg
[17:13:49] <Witchit> I'm also talking about college parties and the pub
[17:13:54] <Witchit> And dude, I understand XD
[17:14:01] <June> lol
[17:14:04] <Witchit> Tuesday morning isn't the right time to be sane
[17:14:18] <June> college parties... pub.... all very social lol
[17:14:38] <Witchit> Yeah. I've only been to a few college parties, partially because of peer pressure
[17:14:45] <Witchit> I'm a desperate woman, what can I say XD
[17:14:53] <June> lol
[17:15:25] <Witchit> I seem to mainly follow my boyfriend around a lot...it sucks to not be motivated to meet others
[17:16:10] <June> not necessarily
[17:16:21] <June> seems to me, you are comfortable with your own company
[17:16:24] <Wolfbane> hmm
[17:16:34] <Witchit> Well yes, I talk online. A LOT. XD
[17:16:38] <Wolfbane> Witchit: find that burning zest for life inside you
[17:16:52] <Wolfbane> and follow your instincts but allow for morals and ethics too
[17:17:00] <Witchit> I could Wolfbane :) That's sound advice
[17:17:10] <Wolfbane> its better then being lead
[17:17:18] <Wolfbane> people will strand you that way
[17:17:23] <Wolfbane> ive been stranded before
[17:17:28] <Witchit> It's just hard to do that with my past and multiple disorders and mental illnesses
[17:17:35] <Wolfbane> people are usually unreliable and they often only care about themselves
[17:17:41] <Wolfbane> thats a harsh truth i had to learn
[17:17:47] <Witchit> Oh no, I know that firsthand
[17:18:10] <Witchit> One ex broke up with me because I'm genderfluid
[17:18:23] <Witchit> And then another friend lied about being....well...sexually assaulted
[17:18:29] <Wolfbane> im definitely a hardened cis male
[17:18:39] <Wolfbane> with no much time for bullcrap
[17:18:39] <Witchit> That's all good, be whoever man :)
[17:18:45] <Wolfbane> no-not
[17:19:06] <Wolfbane> well its not that i am likened to want to be whoever
[17:19:09] <Wolfbane> i just am
[17:19:34] <Witchit> That's a great mentality...I wish others could understand that you don't need to label yourself
[17:19:43] <Witchit> -cough cough- tumblr -cough cough-
[17:19:48] <Wolfbane> huh?
[17:19:59] <Witchit> Oh, you've never heard of tumblr? :/
[17:20:06] <Wolfbane> yes lol
[17:20:10] <Wolfbane> but in this context no
[17:20:50] <Witchit> Tumblr is famous for complaining about little things like being 'triggered' over the misspelling of different genders and sexes
[17:21:10] <Witchit> For instance, one girl accidentally defended the gender of mayonnaise
[17:21:18] <Wolfbane> bwahahha
[17:21:23] <Witchit> Maybe on purpose, I don't know
[17:21:31] <Wolfbane> yea
[17:21:33] <Wolfbane> i dunno
[17:21:35] <Witchit> But the point is that tumblr is REALLY pissy about gender and sex
[17:21:40] <Wolfbane> life is already horrendously complex
[17:21:43] <Wolfbane> i mean
[17:21:49] *** Joins: Iona (uid99355@sorcery-q9or66.richmond.irccloud.com)
[17:21:49] <Wolfbane> why be PC all the damned time
[17:21:51] <Abraxas> Welcome, Iona. The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.
[17:21:54] <Witchit> Hi Iona!
[17:22:02] <Witchit> Today we're talking about labeling yourself :)
[17:22:06] <Iona> Hello Witchit 
[17:22:24] <Wolfbane> well we are actually running the gambit of a few different topics
[17:22:43] <Iona> Today I am a yummy b*tch. Tomorrow I may be a **** to all humanity.
[17:22:56] <Witchit> Heheheh, more like we're talking about gender and sex
[17:23:04] <Iona> Ahhh 
[17:23:11] <Wolfbane> yea i'd rather not
[17:23:14] <Wolfbane> myself
[17:23:33] <Wolfbane> i'd rather talk about life
[17:23:47] <Wolfbane> and the complete mess that is haha
[17:23:49] <Witchit> Then go right ahead, we can stop the conversation at any time :P
[17:24:04] <Wolfbane> heres me
[17:24:08] <Wolfbane> i happen to think
[17:24:15] <Wolfbane> most things in life are freakin pointless
[17:24:21] <Iona> Life... Who said it had to look like one thing or another?...
[17:24:26] <Wolfbane> somethings like a higher education interest me however
[17:24:43] <Wolfbane> im not usually one for learning
[17:24:52] <Wolfbane> but these days i wanna learn big time
[17:25:13] <Wolfbane> im sick of the boring status quo
[17:25:20] <Witchit> That's a good/bad mentality in my honest opinion. It's good to know what things to ignore and what things not to ignore, and it's great you want to learn. That's something not many do nowadays. But not a majority of things are pointless
[17:25:22] <Wolfbane> i need change
[17:25:47] <Wolfbane> theres just so much these days to ignore
[17:25:51] <Wolfbane> so much crap online
[17:26:09] <Wolfbane> its a sesspool of monotony
[17:26:17] <Witchit> We are also constantly changing :) Technology improving with virtual reality and 3D printers, improving gay marriage and transgender rights, etc.
[17:26:27] <Wolfbane> yuh
[17:26:37] <Witchit> Sure there are horrible things online, but think about how amazing it is that we can actually print organs!
[17:26:38] <Wolfbane> it doesn't change the core flaws in humans though
[17:26:51] <Witchit> There are a TON of problems in humanity
[17:26:56] <Wolfbane> i quite hate progress and humanity
[17:27:01] <Witchit> Trust me, I know that firsthand
[17:27:04] <Wolfbane> i'd prefer a simpler time tbh
[17:27:16] <Iona> In other words, I am taking a break from being my usual detached self and going shoe shopping... The variety will actually help me...
[17:27:26] <Wolfbane> ok Iona 
[17:27:49] <Witchit> Are you leaving Iona, or is that a metaphor? :/
[17:27:59] <Witchit> I AM SO GOOD AT READING YOU GUYS
[17:28:18] <Iona> Yes, to both, but not immediately...
[17:28:21] <Wolfbane> btw what letter is this "I" and what letter is this "l"
[17:28:27] <Witchit> Gotcha
[17:28:34] <Iona> iona 
[17:28:45] <Iona> Yeah, fonts...
[17:28:49] <Wolfbane> just saying
[17:28:54] <Iona> :)
[17:28:57] <Witchit> They're the same in roman numerals :D Yay learning!
[17:29:08] <Wolfbane> if you look close the I is actually a skinner then the l
[17:29:14] <Iona> Eh? (Letter A)
[17:29:35] <Witchit> I thought it I was actually 1 in numerals :/
[17:29:41] <Wolfbane> there is a slight difference in those letters
[17:30:00] <Iona> Its too slight a difference...
[17:30:09] <Witchit> But yeah, shoe shopping XD I hate it
[17:30:12] <Wolfbane> I can tell though
[17:30:39] <June> one is L in lower case and the other is i in caps
[17:30:44] <Wolfbane> if l used an L to just say I would you know?
[17:30:51] <Iona> That's right June 
[17:31:11] <Iona> No, I read casually. 
[17:31:17] <Iona> If it fits the context
[17:31:21] <Witchit> I wish I was all for shopping but I can't stand getting my 'unique' body shape and size into clothing and stuffing my fat feet into shoes :P
[17:31:26] <Iona> Then I read it that way
[17:31:29] <Witchit> But that's not what we're talking about XD
[17:31:34] <Wolfbane> hmm
[17:31:43] <Wolfbane> can we make this topic more male friendly?
[17:31:47] <Witchit> Gotcha
[17:31:49] <Wolfbane> just sayin
[17:32:00] <Witchit> I thought shopping was for all genders though :/
[17:32:15] <Iona> Witchit: I have German ancestry and that means size 12w...
[17:32:18] <Wolfbane> shoe shopping not so much
[17:32:25] <Wolfbane> men buy one pair of shoes or maybe two
[17:32:26] <Witchit> Not just shoes though
[17:32:31] <Wolfbane> one pair of runners
[17:32:36] <Witchit> Shopping in general
[17:32:37] <Wolfbane> one going out pair
[17:32:42] <Iona> Men can find shoes that size, but..
[17:32:51] <Wolfbane> hmm
[17:32:55] <Witchit> Iona: What kind of measurement is that :/
[17:32:57] <Wolfbane> then wear mens shoes :)
[17:33:05] <Iona> I almost have to special order...
[17:33:07] <Witchit> I'm not very familiar with sizes
[17:33:08] <Wolfbane> 12 womens
[17:33:16] <Witchit> I know, but is that big?
[17:33:18] <Iona> No. 
[17:33:25] <Witchit> I'm a 7 1/2
[17:33:29] <Witchit> (women's)
[17:33:35] <Iona> Yes it is
[17:33:35] <Witchit> I has tiny, wide feet
[17:33:36] <Wolfbane> hmmm
[17:33:47] <Wolfbane> im a size 9 or 10
[17:33:57] <Wolfbane> somewhere between both depending on the shoe
[17:34:24] <Witchit> I find clothes shopping the most annoying though. AT LEAST YOU HAVE A CONSTANT SIZE WITH SHOES
[17:34:55] <Iona> 12 wide
[17:34:58] <Iona> Sorry, I used the industry abbreviation...
[17:35:02] <Iona> 12 wide
[17:35:03] <Iona> Sorry, I used the industry abbreviation...
[17:35:08] <Witchit> I'm just like "I gained ten pounds. I know! Let's rip apart a shirt I know I can't fit into!"
[17:35:29] <Iona> Yeah... That's not fun...
[17:35:29] <June> american shoes tend to be a narrow fit, while european shoes are a wider fit
[17:35:45] <Witchit> Are you European June? :)
[17:35:56] <June> UK, so kinda yeah
[17:36:00] <Witchit> Ohhhh
[17:36:20] <Witchit> I don't think I knew that about you...cool :) I've been to London, and it's a beautiful spot
[17:36:47] <June> yeah, for visitors, we however take it for granted
[17:37:23] <Witchit> America is actually a nice place. We're just so spoiled that we think that it's awful because of a government that honestly could be worse
[17:37:34] <Iona> Also american sizing is different from European or Oriental sizings...
[17:37:53] <Iona> Sorry for the double posts...
[17:38:01] <Witchit> Yeah, the measurements in America pretend to be special :P
[17:38:10] <Witchit> I didn't notice Iona, you're good :)
[17:41:30] <Iona> I used to sell shoes online... If someone wanted something that fit like something else, I had to get it right the first time...
[17:41:51] <June> that's cool
[17:42:14] <Witchit> Interesting Iona...so you made shoes? :)
[17:42:14] <June> i'd love to sell shoes on line, i absolutely love shoes lol
[17:42:46] <Iona> No
[17:42:50] <Witchit> Oh
[17:43:10] <Iona> It was a big corp
[17:43:16] <Witchit> Ohhhh
[17:43:23] <Witchit> That sounds like a big job
[17:44:15] <Iona> Hmmm I just saw a Ferrari armored truck...
[17:44:17] <Iona> Odd
[17:44:46] <Witchit> Ferrari armored truck? Never heard of one

[17:49:41] <Witchit> It's spring here, though a little colder than average
[17:49:43] <Iona> I like the selection here
[17:49:58] <Witchit> Hopefully you can go tomorrow :)
[17:50:39] <Witchit> H-, it's so nice here my dog constantly is sleeping in the grass
[17:51:02] <H-> nice :O
[17:51:09] <Witchit> Don't worry about the heat though, do you have a fan?
[17:51:12] <H-> my cats sleep on top of eachother mostly
[17:51:17] <Witchit> Hahaha
[17:51:21] <Witchit> Cat jenga
[17:51:26] <H-> yeah
[17:52:14] <Witchit> I made a wonderful cat bed for mine...I'm surprised he didn't ignore it
[17:52:30] <Witchit> Most cats go "300 dollar bed? I'll take the cardboard box please"
[17:53:01] <H-> oh yeah
[17:53:10] <H-> bought a 2 meters high scratching pole
[17:53:16] <H-> they preferred the box it came in
[17:53:29] <H->  /facepalm
[17:53:32] <Witchit> Oh god XD
[17:53:53] <Witchit> I previously had two cats that my mom once dressed in Halloween costumes
[17:53:58] <Witchit> It was not a fun time
[17:53:59] <H-> lol
[17:54:14] <Witchit> It turns out witch hats = suffering for cats
[17:54:35] <H-> oh yeah thats not good
[17:55:00] <Witchit> Yeah. I feel really bad for pets who are forced into clothes
[17:55:07] <H-> same here
[17:55:10] <Witchit> Unless it's useful, don't do it 0_o
[17:55:33] <Witchit> Like, I'll accept coats for the cold, but not wedding veils for pet marriages
[17:55:38] <Witchit> Which is an actual thing
[17:55:58] <H-> pet marriage yeah, some clever people found a way to make money of the rich
[17:56:25] <Witchit> It's really a giant scam
[17:56:31] <Witchit> I am not surprised
[17:56:49] <Witchit> It's also very creepy in my opinion
[17:57:05] <H-> it is
[17:57:07] <Witchit> It's like a live fanfiction
[17:57:30] <Witchit> Where you ship two characters and then smoosh them together awkwardly to make a kiss scene
[17:58:26] <Witchit> But yeah, pets XD
[17:58:44] <H-> :P
[17:59:19] <Witchit> I don't know why I ranted a tad on pet marriages. I think it's because I read a bad fanfiction with a friend last night
[17:59:32] <Witchit> And now I'm projecting all my misery on you, which I apologize XD
[17:59:53] <H-> hey, I work tech support, this is my life ;)
[18:00:19] <Witchit> Oh god, I remember when I worked with animals. A.K.A. movie theater customers
[18:00:27] <Witchit> But tech support sounds like a nightmare
[18:00:43] <H-> working with people is great and horrible at the same time
[18:01:11] <Witchit> I want to be an art therapist in a geriatrics wing, so I can relate with the great part
[18:01:24] <Witchit> But I relate to the horrible part as an ex-usher
[18:01:28] <H-> here's a guy with the IQ of a pineapple that dropped his mouse in a cup of coffee and get's angry it doesnt work anymore
[18:01:37] <Witchit> Oh my god XD
[18:02:18] <Witchit> "Sir, just buy another mouse." "YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO" -chugs coffee with mouse still in it-
[18:02:45] <H-> that's probably a very accurate description
[18:02:51] <Witchit> Ahahaha
[18:03:28] <Witchit> I remember when this one woman came up to me saying that she didn't know why the toilet wasn't working. I went in there, and she had flushed two diapers down the toiler
[18:03:32] <Witchit> *toilet
[18:03:55] <H-> the fact they know nothing about computers is fine, just don't pretend to know more than the guy you're calling and start demanding impossible things
[18:04:06] <H-> oh my..
[18:04:16] <H-> * we've got a special breed over here*
[18:04:55] <Witchit> Hahaha. My favorite story is when five high schoolers tried to get into an r-rated movie by trying to coerce a group of middle-aged people...right in front of me
[18:05:23] <Witchit> "Hey, come on, give me your tickets" Me: "REALLY"
[18:05:38] <H-> who would've thought they'd get noticed eh?
[18:05:45] <Witchit> NO FRIGGIN KIDDING
[18:06:47] <H-> typical cases of what me and my colleagues call " UBNC "
[18:07:00] <H-> User Brain Not Connected
[18:07:34] <Witchit> I also remember an angry mom complaining that her kid got hurt because of us, and that she'd sue us for injury. They went to Oogieloves, which was a movie that wanted you to get out of your seat and dance
[18:07:47] <Witchit> Which was a stupid kid's movie in the first place for doing that
[18:07:55] <H-> I mean.. I don't sit in the trunk of my car, get angry, call a mechanic and yell at him that my steering wheel is gone
[18:08:02] <Witchit> Hahahahaha
[18:08:48] <Witchit> The worst part is that we told her the rules POSTED ON A BOARD IN THE THEATER that we can't touch the kid because we're keeping the kid from being infected
[18:08:58] <Witchit> And she was like "Then change the rules!"
[18:09:03] <Witchit> HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
[18:09:04] <H-> switch cars with computers and all of a suddon it's perfectly normal to swear at the guy on the phone when the computer doesnt start because you didn't switch it on
[18:09:16] <H-> haha yeah, priceless
[18:09:38] <Witchit> Oh god H- I could tell tales
[18:10:08] <Witchit> I won't, because then it'd be like an infinite amount of time with me just ranting XD
[18:10:14] <H-> :P
[18:10:39] <Witchit> Let's just say that it was in a really, really rich environment with spoiled brats
[18:10:57] <Witchit> And a broken down theater that never got any help from anyone
[18:11:47] <H-> ah yeah, rich people that make you wonder how they ever got that money because their IQ is lower than that of a banana
[18:12:13] <Witchit> I naturally got teased in middle school for being middle class in a school full of mansion owners
[18:12:54] <Witchit> We're still to this day scraping by with a decent amount of money while one of my middle school 'friends' owned a theater in her house
[18:13:25] <H-> those are the worst, spoiled rich kids.. what did they do to get rich.. get born ? look araound, not that hard
[18:15:01] <Witchit> To be fair, her mother is a real estate fancy house seller and her dad is like this stay at home guy because they're so wealthy, and she never stuck around to even care about her daughter
[18:15:23] <Witchit> So that might be one reason she was always causing drama and pretending to run away
[18:16:33] <H-> very common thing sadly, I had a friends once whose parents were rich.. went to his house once.. I felt bad for the poor guy.. his parents litteraly did not care for him
[18:16:38] <H-> the attention given was fake
[18:16:58] <H-> they gave him expensive stuff to shut him up
[18:17:22] <Witchit> Yeah. There was even this girl in high school who faked being abused by her mother, which turned out to be cat scratches from her cat
[18:17:30] <H-> he made music, wanted his parents to hear it " oh thats nice honey" was all he got
[18:17:44] <Witchit> That's really depressing H-...
[18:18:01] <H-> it was terrible
[18:18:04] <Witchit> I'm very glad my parents are so caring and able to communicate
[18:18:05] <H-> never went back
[18:18:29] <Witchit> I can understand why
[18:19:14] <Witchit> We're all made from the same material, the least we can do is treat 'ourselves' correctly
[18:19:29] <H-> the same material indeed
[18:19:31] <H-> everything is
[18:20:21] <Witchit> As someone with a lot of spiritual beliefs, especially witchcraft, I believe that our minds are connected
[18:20:37] <Witchit> Even the most insane man or woman can be related in some way
[18:20:49] <H-> I no longer believe that
[18:20:51] <H-> I know it
[18:20:59] <H-> everything is connected
[18:21:15] <Witchit> Yeah...my personal belief is a mixture of psychology and magic
[18:21:26] <Witchit> I am a HUGE fan of the psychologist Jung
[18:21:33] *** Quits: June (June@sorcery-3inl89.cable.virginm.net) (Quit: http://www.kiwiirc.com/ - A hand crafted IRC client)
[18:21:39] <H-> psychology here too, I don't like the word magic personally
[18:22:03] <Witchit> I call it that personally because it's the best word to describe it without confusing another
[18:22:25] <H-> because with my reasoning, magic does not exist, we simply manipulate the "everything that is" and everone does it their own way
[18:23:35] <Witchit> I've never really seen that belief....it's an interesting notion, but I could also argue that karma exists and we can't exactly control fate
[18:24:06] <Witchit> We can't manipulate the laws of the universe, especially ones of my own personal god
[18:24:21] <H-> we can't ? maybe we haven't learned yet
[18:24:47] <H-> and that's the beauty of it :D everyone has their own way and beliefs :)
[18:25:40] <Witchit> Well true, we've gotten very far in religion, and I'm proud to say that more and more people are getting better with accepting beliefs :) But one can't just wish for a dinosaur and then it appears from the blue
[18:25:44] <H-> we can manipulate the law of gravity, I've seen it happen myself, 2 guys lifted a 120 KG guy with 2 fingers
[18:25:58] <H-> that was awesome
[18:26:02] <Witchit> I've actually never seen that! I should check it out
[18:26:09] <H-> it wasn't on stage or anything fake, it was in a living room
[18:26:21] <Witchit> I've seen monks get hit by staffs and not even flinch
[18:26:28] <Witchit> So I can agree that that could happen
[18:27:00] <Witchit> But it takes too powerful of a mind to do that, and even then it's impossible for everyone to be able to do that
[18:27:03] <Iona> The things the body can do is awe-inspiring...  
[18:27:12] <Witchit> Yeah Iona, I agree :)
[18:27:27] <H-> oh everyone can learn it, of that I'm sure
[18:28:28] <Witchit> So you're saying I, a 5'0" 135 lb. girl of 20 years in age could lift one if I learn? It's really, really hard to believe that when I can't even lift my boyfriend off the ground
[18:28:39] <H-> yes you can
[18:29:02] <H-> the guys that lifted the 120KG guy I just told you about
[18:29:08] <H-> they were actually kids
[18:29:11] <Witchit> How? That would mean the people that can do it should share their secrets with the world
[18:29:24] <Witchit> And then everyone would run around being super strong
[18:29:32] <H-> I wish I knew how :P I'd be teaching people
[18:29:32] <Witchit> And it would be chaos 0_O
[18:30:03] <Abraxas> 01,15Bulletin: Welcome to #witches. Here, you will meet and chat with multiple paths. Were a diverse group and home to Wiccans, Heathens, Gnostics, Ecletic Pagans, Spiritualists, Shamanics and so many more. We ask respect for all differing paths. Blessed Be, Namaste', and Wado.
[18:30:09] <Witchit> I feel like there are certain rules to this, and it depends on the most patient and purest of heart
[18:30:41] <H-> yeah.. I abandoned that idea a long time ago, rules are made to limit yourself
[18:30:49] <H-> at least in my appinion ;)
[18:30:56] <H-> oppinion ?
[18:30:56] <Witchit> Also, even though it was a living room, one thing I've learned about is anything can trick you
[18:31:04] <Iona> Witchit: yes, you can learn...
[18:31:16] <Iona> also...  why should they share those "secrets"?
[18:31:26] <Iona> it's not like it's black magick - it is about knowing oneself...
[18:31:32] <H-> ^ that
[18:31:42] <Witchit> Because then we'd apparently become healthier and stronger
[18:32:01] <Iona> and there would be larger extremes of violence...
[18:32:04] <H-> look around, hardly anyone wants to invest the time to get healthy
[18:32:08] <H-> let alone meditate
[18:32:20] <Witchit> Then you shouldn't be doing it in the first place
[18:32:51] <Witchit> If you really want to do it fine, but at least one person would have revealed the secrets by now
[18:33:04] <Iona> they have, and continue to do so... 
[18:33:13] <Iona> and they surround themselves with power-hungry people...
[18:33:17] <H-> have you heard of the ice man ? ;) the dutch guy that climbed the mount everest in nothing but his shorts ?
[18:33:17] <Iona> you don't need that...
[18:33:27] <Witchit> Then don't do it
[18:33:30] <Witchit> Simple as that
[18:33:33] <Witchit> Don't learn
[18:33:37] <Witchit> Don't reveal it on youtube
[18:33:45] <Witchit> Don't release it to the media
[18:34:12] <Witchit> If it's inspiration, it's a crappy one if you're spreading it to power-hungry politicians
[18:34:41] <H-> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Hof
[18:34:45] <H-> click it
[18:35:01] <Iona> clickbait!...
[18:35:04] * Iona giggles...
[18:35:12] <Witchit> There are different immunities that people are born with
[18:35:19] <Witchit> For instance, immunity to pain
[18:35:19] <H-> he climbed 6.7 KM at mount everest in his shorts.. and was fine
[18:35:22] <Iona> immunities are developed...
[18:35:29] <Iona> they do not happen out of thin air
[18:35:38] <H-> they are developed indeed
[18:35:52] <Witchit> Okay, then why still release it?
[18:36:04] <Witchit> If this is very dangerous, why spread the word?
[18:36:22] <Iona> because some people don't care about ethics...
[18:36:47] <Iona> after all, removing limits on oneself is intoxicating...  
[18:37:10] <Witchit> Then this isn't being in peace with oneself
[18:37:15] <Witchit> This sounds unhealthy now
[18:37:25] <Iona> they set a bad example
[18:37:34] <Witchit> Then what is so spiritual about this?
[18:37:36] <Iona> not all examples are bad - Buddha did similar
[18:37:44] <Witchit> Buddha was different
[18:37:57] <Iona> he mastered his body, and wasn't afraid to use it to teach others.
[18:38:18] <Witchit> I like Buddha more because he was doing it humbly
[18:38:30] <Witchit> He was also doing it with less dangerous consequences
[18:38:32] <Iona> that's right - and you find those humble people where?  not on youtube.
[18:38:53] <Witchit> Then why are you so bent on glorifying the kids that could lift so much weight?
[18:38:57] <Iona> not tooting their own horn of "I did this!  look at me!"
[18:39:03] <Witchit> That's not spiritual
[18:39:07] <Witchit> That's advertising
[18:39:29] <H-> somehow I lost where this is going
[18:39:59] <Witchit> You were talking about how it's amazing to see kids lifting so much weight, and that it's a spiritual method of practice
[18:40:03] <Iona> it's communicating, and showing the unpleasant things about sharing "secrets"
[18:40:32] <H-> the kids themself don't matter to be honest, it's that fact that it was possible
[18:40:38] <Witchit> If I'm wrong, then it could also be about being able to do it in the first place, which I already agreed with
[18:40:47] <Witchit> And I believe it
[18:40:57] <Witchit> I just don't think it relates to religion and spirituality
[18:41:16] <H-> spirituality is more than seeing spirits tbh
[18:41:22] <Witchit> I never said that
[18:41:29] <Iona> spirituality isn't just "let's commune with the spirits" - it's also about understanding the flow of spirits in one's life - including in mundane things...
[18:41:40] <Witchit> Once again, I never said that
[18:42:02] <Witchit> If you're relating to my love of spirits, I am more than that
[18:42:12] <Iona> ummm...  *hugs*
[18:42:27] <Iona> clearly there's something unhappy here...  sorry I said anything.
[18:42:38] <H-> yeah, I'm backing out too, sorry
[18:42:42] <Witchit> -hugs- No, I know you weren't insulting me :)
[18:42:42] <H-> didnt expect this
[18:42:46] <Witchit> We can continue
[18:43:06] <Witchit> I was just confused because you started talking about spirits
[18:43:21] <Witchit> And it didn't relate to the conversation
[18:43:46] <H-> so it's all fine then ? ;)
[18:43:55] <Witchit> It was never bad to begin with :)
[18:44:00] <H-> good :P
[18:44:16] <Witchit> And I apologize if I came across as mad, I've kind of had a bad day so far
[18:44:37] <Witchit> But yeah
[18:44:48] <Witchit> Spirituality is much more than spirits
[18:45:02] <H-> spirituality is everything
[18:45:14] <Witchit> It is EXTREMELY important in my opinion
[18:45:26] <H-> it's a name chosen wrong for a concept misunderstood
[18:45:37] <Witchit> Very true :)
[18:46:23] <H-> the name spirituality limits what it really is
[18:46:25] <Witchit> I feel a little uneasy when people tell me religion is evil
[18:46:42] <H-> so yes, spirituality is very much involved in the above said
[18:46:46] <Witchit> That's probably true, I may have worded my terms wrong
[18:47:27] <H-> brb, time for a smoke
[18:47:32] <Witchit> I like saying spirituality because it sounds more connected to the mind and the soul
[18:47:33] <Witchit> Gotcha
[18:47:37] <Witchit> See you H-
[18:47:51] <Witchit> Iona, opinion on spirituality's definition? :)
[18:48:15] <Iona> It profits society better for me to say nothing and for me to watch...
[18:48:26] <Witchit> ...are you upset about what you said?
[18:48:58] <Iona> Yes.  It wasn't the time or place to say such things, even if they were true according to my understanding.
[18:49:24] <Witchit> Nah, I'd understand why'd you think that :)
[18:50:02] <Witchit> Your opinion really does matter though
[18:50:29] <Witchit> And think about it this way. If I really was mad at you, which I'm not in the first place, wouldn't I say something and go offline?
[18:50:35] <Iona> words - it's what you understand in your bones that matters...
[18:50:39] <Iona> no
[18:50:56] <Iona> because I don't exercise that power over you.
[18:51:43] <Iona> you don't need a disagreement to control you.
[18:51:49] <Iona> they happen :)
[18:52:15] <Witchit> Aw, don't think you're mean or anything because you have an opinion
[18:52:47] <Witchit> Even if you did have the opinion you did, you're a very respectable person, and I wouldn't have asked for a better conversation ^ ^
[18:54:39] <Iona> societies tend to be averse to unpleasant things.  secrets are unpleasant not because of what is being shared, but because of the influence it has over others.  This is why I say "know yourself"...
[18:55:03] <H-> and back
[18:55:11] <Witchit> Hi H-!
[18:55:17] <H-> o/
[18:55:21] <Witchit> Iona and I are talking about....something, I forgot :/
[18:55:27] <Iona> influence happens, but standing your own ground in it, so that you're not bent by the situation, is also important...  
[18:55:36] <Witchit> Exactly Iona :)
[18:56:12] <Iona> unfortunately it also leads to insights and knowledge - and the exercise of it - which tend to be more respected than the actual knowing oneself...  and that is "religion..."
[18:56:23] *** Joins: June (June@sorcery-3inl89.cable.virginm.net)
[18:56:23] <Abraxas> Welcome, June. There is no birth of consciousness without pain.
[18:56:26] <Witchit> Right
[18:56:28] <H-> yeah, we can get consumed by our own idea of how things are sadly, happens to me too
[18:56:29] <Witchit> That's a good point
[18:56:54] <Witchit> Spirituality and religion to me are two slightly different things
[18:57:06] <Witchit> When I see them grouped together, I can't help but rant :P
[18:57:10] <Witchit> Hi June!
[18:57:16] <Iona> dogma and rhetoric is "religion..."  
[18:57:19] <June> Withit x
[18:57:22] <Witchit> Yo!
[18:57:30] <Witchit> We're talking about the definition of religion
[18:57:34] <Iona> spirituality - the real exercise of it - is in oneself, and what one does in every facet of life...
[18:57:38] <H-> ranting is fine, but stay respectfull of someone else's opinion / beliefs ;)   (yes, I sometimes fail in that aspect aswell)
[18:57:59] <Iona> spirituality != religion
[18:58:02] <Witchit> Like I said, so far no one's been disrespectful ^ ^
[18:59:14] <Witchit> Spirituality to me is the closest to exercising with healthy methods while focusing on exploring the inner self
[18:59:47] <Witchit> People have different methods regarding the term, but they mostly don't need groups to rely on
[19:00:41] <Witchit> Divination to me, which I absolutely love, is a huge part of spirituality to me because it's personal and helps you become one with yourself and the universe
[19:01:13] <H-> can I throw in a *the universe is the self* ? or is it not time yet ;)
[19:01:23] <Iona> H-, my rant is over, thanks for listening.
[19:01:41] <Witchit> Rant Iona? Did I miss something? o3o
[19:02:27] <Witchit> I saw you typing, but not ranting :/
[19:03:11] <Iona> and we're back to the labels part of the discussion it seems :)
[19:03:21] <Witchit> Wait what
[19:03:25] <H-> lol
[19:03:32] <Witchit> WHAT DID I MISS PEOPLE
[19:05:51] <H-> mere opinions and definitons ;) don't worry
[19:05:59] <Witchit> Cool ^ ^"
[19:06:10] <Witchit> I sometimes get confused about my own talking XD
[19:06:48] <Witchit> I forgot to add that this is just my own term of what spirituality really is
[19:07:00] <Witchit> There are multiple definitions by multiple people
[19:07:50] <H-> this is how wars get started
[19:07:54] <H-> in fact
[19:07:58] * H- starts a war
[19:08:01] <Witchit> XD
[19:08:11] <Witchit> YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIIIIIIIVE
[19:08:18] <Witchit> -falls flat on face-
[19:09:49] <Witchit> -cat sits on back- =w=
[19:11:49] <H-> lol
[19:11:54] <H-> yeah they do that don't they
[19:12:06] <H-> my girlfriend cant do yoga because of our cats
[19:12:13] <Witchit> My cat is actually sitting on my hands right now while I type
[19:12:14] <H-> because the are everywhere
[19:12:25] <Witchit> Oh god how many cats does she have?

[19:13:13] <Witchit> "They are everywhere" -imagines army of cats-
[19:13:14] <H-> but everything is so damn interesting, they are about 17 weeks old now

[19:13:34] <Witchit> They must be adorable :D

[19:18:47] <Witchit> But yay to characters in sync!
[19:19:04] <Witchit> Cool :)
[19:19:07] <H-> (they are brothers)
[19:19:16] <Witchit> Did you get them from the shelter?
[19:19:36] <H-> nah, we were looking for cats and found a nice couple that had these
[19:19:45] <Witchit> Gotcha
[19:19:56] <Witchit> My cat was from the shelter. He was in really bad shape
[19:20:10] <Witchit> His tail is rumored to actually have been cut off by the owner
[19:20:12] <H-> they are a norwegian forest cat / ragdoll mix
[19:20:23] <H-> in other words, very cudly and nice to everyone
[19:20:27] <Witchit> That's wonderful H-....I love long-haired cats
[19:20:40] <Witchit> Slate (my cat) is also long-haired
[19:21:03] <Witchit> He was originally a cat that got locked in the house for 3 months by an abusive owner
[19:21:12] <H-> :(
[19:21:42] <Witchit> His tail was rumored to be chopped off, and when they found him his nose was bruised badly and his fur was mangled
[19:21:56] <Witchit> He was skinny, and had a bad time in the shelter
[19:22:03] <H-> ugh I can't stand stuff like that
[19:22:18] <Witchit> I bought him though, and now he has a good life :)
[19:22:26] <H-> :)
[19:22:43] <Witchit> So in a way, he's the happiest cat I've known
[19:22:50] <H-> that's good :)
[19:23:04] <H-> I honestly don't see how anyone could harm a cat like that
[19:23:05] <Witchit> I'm so proud of him for being so open to people ^ ^
[19:23:11] <Witchit> Yeah...
[19:23:31] <Witchit> They never found the owner because he had left the cat when he moved
[19:23:58] <Witchit> So he kind of got away with it, which really sucks
[19:24:17] <Witchit> But they examined the wounds and saw that it was all man-made

[19:27:44] <Witchit> Hahaha, that's fine

[19:28:10] <Witchit> Because that way animals with a worse life can get a good home
[19:28:25] <H-> yeah true that
[19:29:00] <Witchit> I adopt every time, and when I see the hope in their eyes I know that they're ready for a better life
[19:29:11] <Witchit> The only time I didn't adopt is my dog

[23:43:33] <SpiritSong> i dont know sorry Wolfbane
[23:44:39] <SpiritSong> my methods wouldnt be suited too someone who uses the gym a lot. i only workout up to 40 a day and avoid junk food entirly when trying to lose...good natural healthy food i suppose
