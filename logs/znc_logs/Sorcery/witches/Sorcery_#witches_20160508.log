[00:03:32] <BansheeTears> Did you see Sweeney Todd
[00:03:52] <DawnBat> which one?
[00:03:53] <BansheeTears> Gave me a crush on Sweeney
[00:03:57] <DawnBat> ah that one
[00:04:03] <DawnBat> Saw it when I was like 8 or 9
[00:04:03] <SpiritSong> not me
[00:04:06] <BansheeTears> Tim burton did a version
[00:04:14] <DawnBat> wait
[00:04:18] <BansheeTears> Newer with Johnny deep
[00:04:27] <DawnBat> I was like 8-ish when I saw the Johnny Depp one. Explains sooo much
[00:04:40] <DawnBat> not to mention Cujo when I was 4
[00:04:47] <BansheeTears> There's an earlier one with angels Lansbury
[00:04:58] <BansheeTears> Angela*
[00:05:16] <DawnBat> This movie
[00:05:16] <DawnBat> http://uvmbored.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pans-labyrinth-poster.jpg
[00:05:17] <DawnBat> YES
[00:05:19] <BansheeTears> Yea the book Fuji is a bit different
[00:05:31] <BansheeTears> Pans labyrinth is awesome
[00:05:38] <BansheeTears> Cujo
[00:05:38] <DawnBat> ohmylawdy
[00:05:43] <DawnBat> I wanna see it again (Pans)
[00:05:55] <SpiritSong> i love the sountrack to that
[00:06:00] <BansheeTears> Have you seen the Devils backbone?
[00:06:18] <DawnBat> there was rumors surrounding a Vampire Chronicles (Anne Rice) series with Robert Downy Junior as LEstat
[00:06:19] <BansheeTears> It's Spanish and a ghost story set in an orphanage
[00:06:25] <SpiritSong> not me but it sounds good
[00:06:31] <BansheeTears> It really is
[00:06:50] <SpiritSong> is there any horrod twisted faces distorted in fear?
[00:06:53] <SpiritSong> horrid
[00:06:54] <DawnBat> Lestat played by Robert Downey Junior.......hawt
[00:07:05] <BansheeTears> I likes the movie they did...even though cruise was miscast, he still did well
[00:07:27] <DawnBat> Interview is basically my favorite movie
[00:07:45] <BansheeTears> The atmosphere was captured well
[00:07:48] <DawnBat> Lestat COULD have been more sadisitic...but they also had to cut back on Lestat and Louis' relationship
[00:07:56] <BansheeTears> I don't recall any SpiritSong
[00:08:03] <DawnBat> and they did somewhat butcher Armand but like *fans self*
[00:08:05] <SpiritSong> ok good i can wwatch it then lol
[00:08:13] <BansheeTears> Lol!!
[00:08:14] <SpiritSong> i cant handle distorted faces
[00:08:19] <DawnBat> Antonio Banderas....unf
[00:08:21] <SpiritSong> like in the american verison of the ring
[00:08:28] <SpiritSong> when she is dead in the closet
[00:08:39] <BansheeTears> I was more a lest at fan
[00:09:01] <BansheeTears> Move over sparkles vampires... There's a real vamp in town
[00:09:10] <SpiritSong> hehe
[00:09:23] <DawnBat> Claudia was one of my favorites
[00:09:30] <BansheeTears> Asian horror does a lot of scary faces
[00:09:30] <DawnBat> but Armand is ohmylawdyunf
[00:09:46] <SpiritSong> yeah,,,the asians know how to scare
[00:09:52] * SpiritSong shudders
[00:09:56] <BansheeTears> They really do.
[00:09:57] <DawnBat> although Armand is 17 which is semi-creepy but does it matter? he's fictional and a vampire
[00:10:19] <BansheeTears> Did you read all the books?
[00:10:51] <DawnBat> I have read the first three, The Vampire Armand, Quite a bit of Memnoch The Devil, The Prince Lestat and Pandora
[00:11:12] <DawnBat> she's coming out with a new book soon
[00:11:16] <BansheeTears> Tale of the body thief?
[00:11:27] <DawnBat> that's terrifying BansheeTears
[00:11:30] <SpiritSong> never heard of those
[00:11:30] <BansheeTears> I need to read the Mayfair series
[00:11:31] <DawnBat> I was JUST thinking of that
[00:11:43] <DawnBat> the Mayfair Witches isn't supposed to be THAT great but eh
[00:11:57] <BansheeTears> Did you read interview with the vampire SpiritSong !
[00:11:59] <DawnBat> Also I do LOVE Queen of The Damned (the movie) but compared to the book it's like
[00:12:00] <BansheeTears> ?
[00:12:05] <DawnBat> a dumbpster
[00:12:07] <BansheeTears> Truth

[00:12:11] <SpiritSong> should i?
[00:12:14] <BansheeTears> The book rocked
[00:12:17] <DawnBat> SpiritSong

[05:34:01] * North remarks by the by
[05:34:13] <Alyria> I've had no end of ticks on me. Unfortunately what the lake lacked in leechdom, the surrounding area made up for in ticks.
[05:34:22] <Alyria> Alaren and I watched that not too long ago.
[05:34:46] <North> can ticks be pulled off with tweezers?
[05:35:02] <MissSugar> you have to twist them out

[05:35:28] <North> THANKS
[05:35:30] <Alyria> I don't know I always yank them out in a panic
[05:35:50] <North> I've had leeches, but not ticks
[05:35:55] <MissSugar> twist them gently with a q-tip they will come out painless
[05:36:03] <MissSugar> nature is fun isnt it
[05:36:08] <North> oh my, yes
[05:36:38] <Alyria> I picked one off the back of Alaren's leg once the wrong way - it was swollen and itchy for months after
[05:37:01] <North> not what a guy with legs needs
[05:37:38] <North> I guess stuff can break off inside the leg
[05:37:38] <Alyria> Not at all
[05:37:41] <North> or body part
[05:37:48] <Alyria> I can't believe I was brave enough to do that
[05:38:02] <Alyria> That was the year there were ticks everywhere in Ohio - I remember now.

[18:15:19] <SpiritSongAway> I don't know, if it's a spell only the caster would know the intent. Could be the remanants of a picnic in which the picnicer was writing though.

[18:19:33] <rled> SpiritSongAway: Hi! thanks for the answer. I looked up on the Internet that it could be a spell like "the witches bottle". I'm speculating it had contained something and had been buried in a ritual fashion. I found it under a hazel, on the very furthest edge of the property about a foot into the ground. It's clear it was buried on purpose, but to what purpose, I don't know. Also I can't get my mind around the bone.
[18:19:47] *** Parts: GhostQueen (Mibbit@sorcery-ja0.8nv.212.66.IP) ()

[18:25:20] <rled> SpiritSongAway: It's a very pretty inkwell. Anyhow, this happened some ten years ago. I've kept the inkwell as a memory. I don't know anything about spells, really. But I'm very curious about what this could have meant, and when this could have happened. 
[18:26:08] <rled> ...Also why. People don't just go around casting spells in other peoples gardens.
[18:27:46] <SpiritSongAway> maybe it was before it was your garden ;P
[18:28:08] <rled> SpiritSongAway: This place was just a forest before.
[18:28:42] <SpiritSongAway> well they likley did it when it was forest prehaps?
[18:29:06] <SpiritSongAway> though digging up for building prolly would have unearthed it

[18:32:00] <SpiritSongAway> im simple enough but the person still needs to know how to work with magickal energies
[18:33:21] <SpiritSongAway> its
[18:33:23] <SpiritSongAway> not im
[18:34:05] <rled> SpiritSongAway: Could it be two separate spells? The bone having something to do with the other one?
[18:34:57] <SpiritSongAway> if they are together, likley the same spell. but i dont know to be honest what their intent could have been
[18:35:02] <SpiritSongAway> only they know really
[18:37:55] <rled> SpiritSongAway: Is there something general to spells where something is buried? Is there something general to spells where animal bones are used? Is there something general to spells where an inkwell is used?
[18:38:55] <SpiritSongAway> bones are sometimees used in working protection magic
[18:39:30] <SpiritSongAway> i dont know about there things are buried but usualy places where things wont be dug up,,,or the thought they wouldnt be, like the forest
[18:39:38] <SpiritSongAway> and inkwells, no idea
[18:40:16] <SpiritSongAway> someone might have used it as a simple container for a spell
[18:40:20] <SpiritSongAway> if it was one at all
[18:41:23] <SpiritSongAway> some people like to use quill and ink to write out their spells rather than use a modern pen though
[18:41:42] <SpiritSongAway> i dont, i just use whatever is there, pen, pencil, colouring pencil lol
[18:42:14] <SpiritSongAway> this might interest you

[18:45:58] <rled> SpiritSongAway: Nice text. Thanks. I don't have the bone anymore though. I think I burned it with some rubbish.
[18:47:33] <rled> SpiritSongAway: It was a mammal bone, for sure.
[18:48:23] <SpiritSongAway> nods, they often are, or chicken bones
[18:50:57] <rled> SpiritSongAway: It was buried, and therefore intended not to be found, but why was it so easy to find? It was like I was drawn to put my shovel down on the spot.
[18:51:22] <SpiritSongAway> because the person who buried it was bad at hiding things i suppose
[18:51:45] <SpiritSongAway> and im not smart mouthing you there...i just speak very literally at times lol
[18:52:12] <rled> SpiritSongAway: Internet says buried spells are broken when they are found.
[18:55:09] <SpiritSongAway> hope it wasnt an important one then
[18:57:17] <rled> SpiritSongAway: What if it was?
[18:57:47] <SpiritSongAway> i dont know

[19:01:18] <rled> SpiritSongAway: Let's assume it was a benevolent protection spell, made by a person I know, but without my knowledge. I broke the spell with my divining (pun intended) shovel, because that benevolent person was bad at hiding things. What ever the protection spell was intended to protect against was important enough to take the risk of breaking secrecy?
[19:03:52] <rled> SpiritSongAway: How to redo, I guess?

[22:33:16] <SpiritSong> oooh how did it go
[22:33:29] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It was marvelous.
[22:34:05] <SpiritSong> was there a feast afterwards?
[22:34:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Of course. What's a Beltane ritual without a feast?
[22:34:50] <SpiritSong> hehehe
[22:34:52] <SpiritSong> ^_^
[22:36:10] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Probably will be the same for Litha. This is kind of a new group, formed to perform ritual for ALL Sabbats. 
[22:36:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The other two groups hold the festivals, and do a ritual at them, but they are not always actually ON a Sabbat.
[22:37:02] <SpiritSong> omg that sounds so amazing
[22:37:05] <SpiritSong> i wish i was there
[22:37:07] <SpiritSong> :/
[22:37:07] <SpiritSong> lol
[22:37:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> This last festival was one that was, so it was very energy filled.
[22:37:38] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> You'd hace loved it, lass.
[22:38:31] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The two felows who hosted it are the couple who got married a couple weeks ago, just before the last festival.
[22:39:08] <SpiritSong> awww so it was a very happy ritual too ^_^
[22:39:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Their house is great, they've got an altar in every room but the loo.
[22:40:04] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And images of MANY Goddesses and Gods.
[22:40:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> If there's a diety they DON'T turn to, I'd be surprised.
[22:43:08] <SpiritSong> lol so funny if it was in the loo too
[22:43:19] <SpiritSong> its sounds awesome
[22:45:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The loo is all decorated in a zombie motif.
[22:46:06] <SpiritSong> lmao
