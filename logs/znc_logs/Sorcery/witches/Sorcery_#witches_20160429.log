[13:45:37] <Keith> hows the music coming along Rajoguna?
[13:47:03] <Rajoguna> it's going good. I gutted this track and rewrote it with a new melody and a new scale. suprised ive gotten it to fit as well with some stuff thats off scale too. im writing up the climax/conclusion right now... when I'm done composing it I'm going to see and make sure all elements are balanced and tweak the writing then get down to the final stages of mixing and mastering
[13:47:26] <Keith> I told you it would come along... didn't I?? :)
[13:47:44] <Rajoguna> its pretty well mixed already so ill probably just do some panning. I've changed my approach to imagine how all of this would look on sheet music.
[13:47:51] <Rajoguna> i guess so
[13:48:04] <Keith> progress is progress
[13:56:06] <Hexe> Ok im off to sleep..be well everybody

[14:57:16] <Rajoguna> well i finsihed  up the forum post
[14:57:42] <Rajoguna> it was about fairies on a religious site
[14:57:55] <Keith> cool
[14:58:22] <Rajoguna> someone asked about fairies in the comparative religion section and so i posted my own experiences
[14:58:38] <Keith> good good
[14:58:38] <Rajoguna> it's a cool site religiousforums.com
[14:59:28] <Keith> i doubt i'll check it out though.... i dont care much about religions
[14:59:40] <Rajoguna> they got a section for pretty much every religion... there is a section where people of those religions can post without being pestered by others except if they want to ask questions
[14:59:44] <Rajoguna> hm
[14:59:58] <Keith> never really interested me :)
[15:00:04] <Rajoguna> well i like it because I learn a lot there and there is a section for magic and witchraft too
[15:00:13] <Rajoguna> then why are u here lol
[15:00:42] <Keith> it's not about religion. it is about peoples different outlooks on things, that bring me here
[15:00:58] <Keith> and their ideas on topics.
[15:01:56] <Keith> gives me a chance to grow and expand my own personal beliefs

[20:04:34] <Abraxas> Welcome, Babebarian. The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.
[20:04:44] <North> good greetings, Hyborian
[20:04:51] <Babebarian> Greetings North
[20:04:55] <Babebarian> How are you?

[20:05:05] <Babebarian> Hahaha, I hope a good one
[20:05:25] <tremens> heh, well that depends I suppose :P
[20:05:34] <Babebarian> As do so many things in life
[20:05:50] <tremens> Situation dependent, really
[20:05:57] <Keith> how long you been sick for Aria?
[20:07:42] <North> a while, it seems   :/
[20:12:51] <North> poor m'Aria
[20:12:55] <Keith> oh well
[20:13:04] <Aria> About a week...
[20:13:06] <North> still overseas, Evie?
[20:13:12] <Babebarian> still in Ukraine, tak
[20:13:16] <Babebarian> for 25 more months
[20:13:16] <Keith> I hope you get better soon  :)
[20:13:21] <Aria> thank you Keith :)
[20:13:23] <North> 25!
[20:13:27] <Babebarian> da
[20:13:31] <Keith> of course Aria :)
[20:13:34] <Babebarian> two down
[20:13:36] <Babebarian> 25 to go
[20:13:42] <Keith> Babebarian hows it going out east?
[20:13:56] <Babebarian> It's going well, the weather is beautiful 
[20:14:03] <Keith> fantastic :)
[20:14:18] <North> has that family warmed up any?
[20:14:31] <Babebarian> a bit...I mean I'm still a little awkward around them
[20:14:36] <Babebarian> my language has improved
[20:14:42] <North> good stuff
[20:14:44] <Babebarian> I'm just not as good at asserting myself in every situation 
[20:15:08] <Keith> i am sure you will get the hang of it shorty :)
[20:15:54] <Babebarian> Yeah, I have no doubts
[20:16:17] * Keith gives you a big energy filled hug
[20:16:32] * Babebarian hugs back
[20:16:37] <Keith> :D
[20:16:39] <Babebarian> when I break fast, I'll have a lot more energy 
[20:17:00] <Keith> yayyyyy :)
[20:17:04] <North> especially if that breakfast happens to be Lucky Charms
[20:17:07] * North conjectures
[20:17:09] <Keith> what time is it there?
[20:17:10] <Babebarian> hahaha
[20:17:11] <Babebarian> not in Ukraine
[20:17:15] <Babebarian> it's 9:17
[20:17:25] <Keith> holy lateish
[20:17:31] <Babebarian> ahahha
[20:18:43] <North> have you encountered the Women Of The Forest yet?
[20:19:04] <Babebarian> I have
[20:19:09] <North> !
[20:19:10] * Keith so needs to get laid
[20:19:15] <North> lol
[20:19:16] <Keith> I wanna go there
[20:19:17] <Iona> That's awesome news.
[20:19:27] <North> quite the experience, I wager
[20:20:15] <North> (meeting the Women Of The Forest....not getting laid)
[20:20:18] * North clarifies
[20:20:20] <Keith> lol
[20:20:32] <Keith>  what is the "women of the forest" thing?
[20:20:33] <Babebarian> they were extremely interesting to meet
[20:20:41] <Babebarian> I met them alone, like two weeks ago
[20:20:46] * Iona nods
[20:20:55] <Iona> what are you able to share about them?
[20:20:56] <Keith> congrats
[20:21:06] <North> were you met with friendliness or suspicion?
[20:21:15] <Babebarian> a bit of both
[20:21:20] * North nods
[20:21:28] <Babebarian> more friendliness when I started speaking with them more openly 
[20:21:44] <Keith> interesting
[20:22:09] <North> <Babebarian>  "Also, I brought pizza!"   <Women Of The Forest>   :D
[20:22:23] <Babebarian> hahaha
[20:22:36] <North> most forests laying outside of the delivery zone
[20:22:47] <Babebarian> They live in the Carpathians 
[20:22:54] <North> ah, k
[20:23:52] <Keith> that is mountainous area, yes?
[20:24:25] <Babebarian> It is
[20:24:32] <Keith> I bet it is beautiful
[20:24:45] <Babebarian> It was...green as far as you could see
[20:24:49] <Babebarian> we were in a small hut
[20:24:50] <Babebarian> with a warm fire
[20:24:57] <Iona> :)
[20:24:57] <North> will you be seeing them again?
[20:25:10] <Keith> can you take pics of the area?
[20:25:12] <Babebarian> I'd like to...our conversation...I mean...it's hard to explain in words 
[20:25:17] <Babebarian> I'd have to sneak them
[20:25:28] <Iona> It's better not to break their trust, Keith
[20:25:28] <Keith> no no.. dont want you to get in trouble
[20:25:38] <Keith> Iona.. I agree :)
[20:25:54] <Babebarian> ^
[20:26:30] <Babebarian> but yeah I mean I can go on if you guys want me to
[20:26:34] <Babebarian> it was pretty intense 
[20:26:37] <Keith> \o
[20:26:41] <North> absolutely
[20:26:42] <Iona> I'd really appreciate it...
[20:26:52] <Keith> yes please do
[20:27:02] <Babebarian> So they took me inside...and one of them spoke English 
[20:27:16] <Babebarian> so they were able to interpret 
[20:27:29] <Babebarian> technically I wasn't allowed to even go, but hey fuck it

[20:27:35] <Babebarian> sorry
[20:27:38] <Babebarian> anyways
[20:27:39] <Keith> no worries
[20:28:21] <North> not allowed to go...in the hut?
[20:28:40] <Babebarian> no, PC wouldn't let me actually go
[20:28:43] <Babebarian> so I just went anyways
[20:28:46] <Babebarian> broke the rules if you will
[20:28:47] <Babebarian> lol
[20:29:08] <Iona> PC?

[20:30:01] <Babebarian> my organization I'm in Ukraine with
[20:30:08] <Iona> ahhh
[20:30:18] <Keith> why wouldn't they let you go?
[20:30:22] <Babebarian> danger
[20:30:25] <Babebarian> protocol 
[20:30:26] <Babebarian> etc
[20:30:53] <North> also, hanging out with the wilderness women might be more interesting
[20:30:57] * North supposes
[20:31:07] <Keith> gotchas
[20:31:20] <North> can't have folks defecting
[20:31:29] <Babebarian> Hahaha, indeed,
[20:31:40] <Babebarian> so they took me in, gave me tea, and then asked why I came
[20:31:44] <Babebarian> and I said I wanted to learn about them
[20:31:54] <Babebarian> then one took my hand and started chanting 
[20:32:56] <Babebarian> I didn't know how to join in
[20:33:11] <Babebarian> then one took my cup and drank from it
[20:33:12] <North> prelude to some sort of Sapphic intiation?
[20:33:15] * North asks hopefully
[20:33:22] <Babebarian> and then started to tell me how they knew who I was
[20:33:26] <Babebarian> and what I wanted to be
[20:34:08] <Babebarian> so that was intense 
[20:34:17] <Keith> too cool
[20:34:45] <Babebarian> the tea had something in it
[20:34:51] <Babebarian> cause I did start to trip a little bit
[20:34:51] <Keith> mmmmmm tea
[20:35:42] <Babebarian> and then yeah, we started talking about barbaric things, how I came to Ukraine to live in the traditional lands of the Amazons
[20:35:45] <Babebarian> and stuff like that
[20:38:06] * Iona nods...
[20:38:26] <Iona> than you for sharing, Babebarian 
[20:38:33] <Babebarian> They called me sister by the end
[20:38:38] <Iona> :)
[20:38:40] <Keith> i hope you are able to get in more visits
[20:38:44] <Babebarian> But I know, if I go back
[20:38:49] <Babebarian> the witch who brought me in
[20:38:59] <Babebarian> We'd go out into the woods
[20:39:03] <Babebarian> and make love to each other
[20:39:12] * Iona giggles...
[20:39:22] <Iona> that's beautiful :)
[20:39:26] <Keith> well that sounds fun :)
[20:39:30] <Babebarian> Hahaha, indeed
