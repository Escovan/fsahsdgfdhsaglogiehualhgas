[00:06:54] <SpiritSong> yus ^_^
[00:06:58] <widdershins> ive been asked to storytell at tle library
[00:07:07] <SpiritSong> oooh lucky feckers, with that voice

[00:07:36] <widdershins> it would be fun...but i dont do kids well
[00:07:39] <SpiritSong> to kids or others?

[00:10:04] <SpiritSong> kids have no filters
[00:10:15] <widdershins> neither do some grown ups
[00:10:27] <SpiritSong> this is true
[00:10:42] <SpiritSong> xD
[00:11:03] <widdershins> with kids a lack of empathy can be written off as lack of experiences- with adults its just meanness
[00:11:32] <SpiritSong> yup
[00:11:46] <widdershins> yet old folks often have such empathy- they can calm ya down with a few word and a look
[00:11:47] <SpiritSong> much of the time, kids are just saying what they see
[00:11:59] <widdershins> yup
[00:11:59] <SpiritSong> adults will say it to hurt

[02:53:05] <Orama> i did a native american rain dance the other day too lol

[02:53:22] <widdershins> musta been awesome
[02:53:31] <Orama> 0/10 would not shake the booty for the rain gods again
[02:53:38] <RainyNight> I'm a heathen
[02:53:41] <Xt> Sounds dangerous. What if that water was taken from some drier place?
[02:53:57] <DawnBatGuano> I had a thought.
[02:53:58] <Orama> Look i dont know how it works
[02:54:13] <Orama> i just know it rained too much and i felt pretty dumb
[02:54:15] <DawnBatGuano> Hecate sounds a lot like Heka (being not only the God of Magic but also magic itself)
[02:54:19] <Xt> I'll get you a link to Orgone Accumulator Handbook
[02:54:51] * widdershins goes back to beading..
[02:55:05] <Keith> how is your tree coming along widdershins?
[02:55:08] <Xt> I think there's one in the Fridge library
[02:55:18] <DawnBatGuano> So today I predicted a ladies babies gender before she evn said it.
[02:55:23] <Xt> oh here we go
[02:55:51] <Orama> No thanks xt im not messing with magic anymore
[02:55:55] <Orama> spoops me
[02:56:17] * DawnBatGuano flips through his book for a banishing.
[02:56:22] <widdershins> finished the tree, now waiting on some supplies to finish the rest, but they're coming from china

[02:56:36] <Xt> http://www.orgonelab.org/
[02:56:44] <Xt> The dangers of weather manipulation
[02:56:47] <Xt> exposed
[02:57:14] <DawnBatGuano> I has a question
[02:57:31] <DawnBatGuano> If a particular magic practice has very very ancient roots would that make it stronger perhaps?
[02:58:14] <widdershins> the strength depends on the practitioner imo. To me it comes from the same well
[02:58:36] <MissSuugar> agreed widders
[02:58:36] <Keith> the only thing that would make it stronger would depend on the people doing it, and there ability to perform the spells
[02:58:42] <Xt> no necessarily, especially if you start working with alternate timelines and dimensional beings outside of linear time
[02:58:43] <DawnBatGuano> Makes sense.
[02:59:12] <DawnBatGuano> technically Gods or pretty much any spiritual entity isn't even part of this existence
[02:59:34] <Orama> dont think they feel the same way
[02:59:46] <Xt> Have to take into account caster ability, spell purpose and mechanics, energy, timing
[03:00:09] <DawnBatGuano> Echoes (what I call ghosts sometimes) are pretty much kind of in another existence.
[03:00:14] <Xt> and also target traits
[03:00:18] <DawnBatGuano> Halfway
[03:01:27] <DawnBatGuano> to watch Sabrina or not to watch Sabrina
[03:02:07] <Xt> tv is bad for you
[03:02:26] <widdershins> have you seen Bless me Ultima?
[03:02:37] <widdershins> think you'd like it

[03:04:58] <DawnBatGuano> ugh I wish Sabrina was on netflix
[03:05:28] <Xt> DawnBatGuano cast a spell to summon it to netflix then
[03:05:29] <Xt> or did you just?
[03:05:44] <DawnBatGuano> that'd be a miracle
[03:06:13] <DawnBatGuano> whereas Charmed is mostly serious, Sabrina is comedic
[03:06:40] <Xt> what's the difference? They're both role play.
[03:06:50] <DawnBatGuano> wait wut
[03:07:32] <Keith> movies and tv shows arent roleplaying
[03:07:48] <DawnBatGuano> they're basically alternate realities

[03:15:34] <DawnBatGuano> In theory due to my connection with electronics I could probably do long distance magic with the interwebs
[03:15:37] <MissSuugar> almost not worth it
[03:15:51] <Xt> ASTRAL PROJECT IT TO ME
[03:15:59] * Felis_ pets Xt
[03:16:00] <Orama> wait
[03:16:05] <Xt> Are you all really so bound to this plane?
[03:16:05] <Orama> zombiefication
[03:16:14] <Xt> No physical treats or trinkets and what are you?
[03:16:14] <DawnBatGuano> Yep
[03:16:14] <MissSuugar> there is a Lwa that deals with electronics 
[03:16:15] <DawnBatGuano> It's true
[03:16:18] <Orama> arent we going a little overboard
[03:16:27] <DawnBatGuano> MissSuugar: Hmmm, hsi/her name?
[03:16:31] <MissSuugar> Simbi
[03:16:37] <DawnBatGuano> Also...Lwa is spirits right? Or
[03:16:40] <MissSuugar> yes
[03:16:45] <Orama> I like the guy that drinks rum and smokes
[03:16:49] <DawnBatGuano> Hmmm
[03:16:54] <Orama> the baron
[03:16:54] <Xt> SpiritSong, GDfriend says "Hi"
[03:16:56] <Felis_> Baron Samedi?
[03:16:59] <MissSuugar> so what all of them Orama
[03:17:01] <Orama> sounds like a cool guy
[03:17:09] <DawnBatGuano> I think that using Lwa for my such and such wouldn't be too bad
[03:17:16] <DawnBatGuano> Considering Voodoo and such has African roots
[03:17:16] <Felis_> I have spooky story involving baron samedi but meh
[03:17:20] <MissSuugar> because most of the Lwa smoke, and all of them will drink rum
[03:17:26] <Orama> well its jsut the stories i heard and he sounds cool

[03:17:56] <Felis_> a lot of reasons to believe he was/was related to Samedi pretty hard
[03:17:59] <MissSuugar> uhg
[03:18:04] <Felis_> just his actions, spooky shit, drinking
[03:18:10] <Felis_> We played games together
[03:18:12] <Felis_> very fun guy
[03:18:30] <DawnBatGuano> MissSuugar: the Lwa sound expensive to please and revere
[03:18:42] <MissSuugar> they can be expensive to feed
[03:18:47] <Felis_> Its been forever, I can't explain the guy
[03:18:49] <Orama> I also drink a lot so many its related
[03:18:59] <Orama> maybe*

[04:05:47] <DawnBat> I had an intriguing plot twist.
[04:06:15] <DawnBat> maybe the Succubi and Incubi are actually hags in their True Form
[04:06:27] <Pores> I think most beings cannot shapeshift nowadays. They used to be able to, but beings are reincarnating from non-shapeshifting lives, and therefor they're starting to lose it

[04:53:14] <SpiritSong> lol
[04:53:24] <SpiritSong> what is the meaning of those numbers
[04:53:49] <Hrafnbjorn> is that meant as a Hitchhiker's reference, ArchrWndrMcRbrt?
[04:54:37] <MissSuugar> of course!
[04:55:02] <CantSirDraggin> a=1, b=2, etc

[04:55:15] <SpiritSong> ahhh
[04:55:29] <SpiritSong> lol draggin i get that paart
[04:55:34] <CantSirDraggin> 42 is the meaning of life according to the hitch hiker's guide to the galaxy
[04:55:38] <Hrafnbjorn> ok, good.. I wasnt sure if my memory was correct on which # he used in the book, lol
[04:55:42] <CantSirDraggin> which i didn't read either
[04:55:48] <SpiritSong> i just dont know why the numbers were significant till now hah
[04:56:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It's in the movie, CantSirDraggin
[04:56:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> also the BBC TV mini-series

[04:56:41] <Hrafnbjorn> *series
[04:56:55] <MissSuugar> ok so in the story these highly advanced creatures build a machine to tell them the meaning of life, and they ask it "what is the meaning of life, the universe and everything"
[04:56:59] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The BBC did one back in the 80's, I believe.
[04:57:03] <MissSuugar> the machine answers "42"

[05:02:13] <Hrafnbjorn> what would be some good stuff to carve on a walkinf stick?   Besides rune of course

[05:02:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Celtic knot
[05:03:08] <Hrafnbjorn> I do a lot of knotwork... tis a good idea
[05:03:09] <CantSirDraggin> nike sigul?
[05:03:17] * SpiritSong thinks
[05:03:24] <CantSirDraggin> almost makes sense really
[05:03:33] <SpiritSong> Hrafnbjorn
[05:03:54] <Hrafnbjorn> although, typicaly not the symetrical style associated with Celts
[05:03:58] <Hrafnbjorn> SpiritSong?
[05:04:07] <SpiritSong> we have this big flower pot outside, i think might inspire you. ill get a pic of the patern for you tomorroe
[05:04:16] <SpiritSong> its tribalish..but not
[05:04:20] <Hrafnbjorn> ok :)
[05:04:21] <MissSuugar> oh oh oh i have an idea
[05:04:24] <SpiritSong> :D
[05:04:30] <MissSuugar> a labyrinth 
[05:04:59] <Hrafnbjorn> labrynths are surprisingly hard to carve... same with any spiral shape
[05:05:14] <MissSuugar> bummer :(
[05:05:30] <Hrafnbjorn> tis a good idea though... worth at least a try
[05:05:31] <CantSirDraggin> draw three times, carve once?
[05:05:59] <CantSirDraggin> think parody of measure twice, cut once
[05:06:45] <Hrafnbjorn> meh drawing it on first os for folk who know what they are doing... I just jump in and hope for the best :)
[05:07:07] <CantSirDraggin> lol
[05:07:33] <SpiritSong> hehe
[05:07:51] <CantSirDraggin> i spend almost as long on most stones turning them over and picturing how the wire is going to work as i do actually wrapping

[05:08:12] <Hrafnbjorn> *thick
[05:08:17] <SpiritSong> what about carving vines flowing up it
[05:08:30] <Hrafnbjorn> did I show you my second wirewrap attempt, CantSirDraggin?
[05:08:37] <CantSirDraggin> not sure
[05:08:43] <Hrafnbjorn> vines are a great idea... had not thought about that...

[05:09:47] <Hrafnbjorn> *knotwork
[05:10:01] <SpiritSong> have you ever used a wood buring took Hrafnbjorn
[05:10:04] <CantSirDraggin> assuming for the wire being stiff enough
[05:10:18] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah its way more solid... I still didnt wrap parts as much as I thought I was, but it holds good
[05:10:30] <SpiritSong> ooh yeah that looks awesome Hrafnbjorn ^_^
[05:10:51] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, I used a woodburner on the walking stick I made my dad for his BD, cause its very pale wood, and carving doesnt show on it well

[05:20:22] <SpiritSong> i am in my nelly
[05:20:33] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I suspect she has a bit of impin her, however.
[05:20:46] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> imp in
[05:22:25] <MissSuugar> SpiritSong, is evil
[05:22:31] <North> back in high school, we used to call her Impy Birdy
[05:22:39] * North edits the Past
[05:22:47] <Felis_> Imp in her?
[05:22:50] <MissSuugar> she has everyone convinced that she is sweet, but i know the truth, she is the debil!
[05:23:05] <SpiritSong> oh yeah im the evilest:P
[05:23:13] <MissSuugar> :P
[05:23:37] <North> don't even get me started on Wordy...
[05:24:13] * Felis_ pet wordy
[05:24:19] <CantSirDraggin> i just have no comment
[05:24:50] * Felis_ pet comment
[05:24:52] <SpiritSong> oh wordy is the the devils evil twin
[05:25:08] <North> true fact
[05:25:24] <MissSuugar> Facts.
[05:25:31] * CantSirDraggin slaps Felis_ with a big red brick
[05:26:02] * Felis_ pet big red brick
[05:26:33] * ArchrWndrMcRbrt is confuzzled
[05:26:39] <CantSirDraggin> in mother russia, big red brick pets you
[05:26:45] <Felis_> ;3
[05:26:56] <Pores> hehe
[05:26:59] <Felis_> thats okay I like pets
[05:27:05] <CantSirDraggin> clearly
[05:27:07] <Felis_> feel free to send all russian big red bricks my way
[05:27:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> What about Lithuanian big red bricks??
[05:27:48] <CantSirDraggin> they just make walls and things
[05:27:54] <MissSuugar> speaking of which i still have not found my red brick
[05:27:59] <Felis_> I can pet those tho
[05:28:24] * Felis_ pet MissSuugar's red brick
[05:28:46] <Hrafnbjorn> I have red bricks... lemme know if ya need one, MissSuugar... although probably pricey to ship
[05:28:55] <MissSuugar> well its going to need it after i pound it into dust
[05:28:58] <CantSirDraggin> lol, likely
[05:29:02] <SpiritSong> lol very pricey
[05:29:07] <MissSuugar> they are only 45 cents at the store
[05:29:13] <CantSirDraggin> sent widders some sliced agate bookends once
[05:29:20] <MissSuugar> i just dont want to pick up a single red brick after the looks i got last time
[05:29:24] <CantSirDraggin> more to ship than to buy
[05:29:36] <MissSuugar> we had like a bunch of wood, some chip board, and one red brick
[05:29:51] <MissSuugar> the lady was like "annnnnd one red brick?"
[05:29:55] <MissSuugar> "yup"
[05:30:00] <MissSuugar> "okkkk"
[05:30:27] <SpiritSong> jsut telll her is is a replacement for a garden wall
[05:30:39] <SpiritSong> and that just because she doesnt maintain her wall, get off yours :PP
[05:31:05] <CantSirDraggin> more fun being honest in this case, i think
[05:31:08] <MissSuugar> because i am a jerk, i told her that i grew attached to it in the store and had named it bricky
[05:31:17] <CantSirDraggin> or that
[05:31:23] <MissSuugar> and couldnt bare to be parted with it
[05:31:28] * Felis_ pet bricky
[05:32:01] <SpiritSong> hahahahhah
[05:32:41] * Hrafnbjorn sighs
[05:33:20] * Felis_ pet hrafnbjorn
[05:33:37] * CantSirDraggin passes the spear
[05:33:52] <Hrafnbjorn> tempting :)
[05:34:04] * Felis_ pet spear
[05:34:10] <Felis_> :3:3:3:3:3
[05:34:16] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I have a friend who brought back a red brick from New Orleans. From one of the streets. It may have once or tice actually been trod upon by Marie, as it was from the street in front of her old shop.
[05:34:17] <CantSirDraggin> asking for it, heh
[05:34:37] <SpiritSong> oh wow
[05:34:41] <Felis_> Do you not like pets CantSirDraggin
[05:34:57] <CantSirDraggin> or no, cause likely not the first time someone's pulled up a brick from there
[05:35:28] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> She broke it into pieces, and gave them out at Imbolc.
[05:35:30] <CantSirDraggin> gotta figure they get replaced a lot
[05:35:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Might be
[05:35:41] <MissSuugar> well that will for sure keep the evil out
[05:35:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I still have to grind mine up
[05:36:35] <SpiritSong> what do you use to grind them
[05:36:45] <MissSuugar> i was just going to break out a hammer
[05:36:51] <SpiritSong> it woould destroy a morter and pestle
[05:36:56] <SpiritSong> oh good idea
[05:37:12] <CantSirDraggin> and an old towel
[05:37:28] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The pieces I have are small, a little bit more than pea sized

[05:41:04] <DawnBat> I have a good feeling he is intimately connected with dragons somehow.
[05:42:26] <MissSuugar> LOL
[05:42:34] <DawnBat> wat
[05:42:58] <MissSuugar> interrupted by the lollipops that home depot always have
[05:43:05] <DawnBat> ah
[05:43:06] <MissSuugar> which i always buy like 20 of
[05:43:06] <CantSirDraggin> he's crunchy and good with katsup

[05:43:24] <DawnBat> CantSirDraggin: I think it might be a spiritual thing
[05:43:30] <MissSuugar> so its more like "i love you bricky"  "silence" "ohhhhh lollipops"
[05:43:35] <North> lol

[05:45:09] <DawnBat> awwwwwww
[05:45:17] <DawnBat> I found a movie called Autism In Love ^^
[05:45:32] <SpiritSong> i should have put lollipops in your box
[05:45:52] <Pores> I've had people closely connected with dragons in my social circle before
[05:46:05] <Pores> Interesting people
[05:46:30] <DawnBat> I don't believe that dragons are in this existence anymore.
[05:46:36] <DawnBat> but they can still be tied to it.
[05:46:44] * Felis_ pet dragon
[05:46:54] <Pores> I think they just hide really well
[05:47:02] <MissSuugar> awww you gave me too much already spirit
[05:47:15] <DawnBat> found a show for SpiritSong and MissSuugar
[05:47:18] <DawnBat> Warrior Women
[05:47:34] <Pores> I think there are dragons spiritually though
[05:47:53] <DawnBat> that's what I mean
[05:47:59] <Pores> For sure
[05:48:06] <DawnBat> like ghosts but wayyy stronger
[05:48:09] <Pores> I've had feelings there were dragons hiding in the clouds
[05:48:19] <MissSuugar> well there are different classifications of spirits
[05:48:19] <Pores> I'm sure they are very powerful o.o
[05:48:30] <Felis_> I am very powerful
[05:48:32] <Felis_> with pets
[05:48:43] <MissSuugar> when i think of spirits i think god like 
[05:48:49] <Pores> I'm powerful with brotherhood/sisterhood
[05:48:51] <Hrafnbjorn> Felis_, please refrain from trolling
[05:48:55] <North> lord of the pets, no less
[05:48:55] <DawnBat> it may sound crazy but I think my brothers connection with dragons is reincarnation related.
[05:49:07] <MissSuugar> when i want to talk about people who are trapped i say ghosts
[05:49:10] <Felis_> But Im not trolling
[05:49:12] <Felis_> How am I trolling
[05:49:13] <Pores> That's how it was with the people I knew, DawnBat
[05:49:19] <Felis_> Is a sarcastic comment trolling?
[05:49:26] <Felis_> Why do people hate me here when I havent done anything
[05:49:27] <DawnBat> I just had a thought.
[05:49:30] <Pores> Like a mother or something. There was a birth of a new dragon at the time
[05:49:37] <Hrafnbjorn> when it is every statement you make, yes
[05:49:53] <DawnBat> Me an him are blood-brothers. That might make our spiritual bond very intense.
[05:49:53] <Pores> He is just being a joker
[05:50:11] <Pores> It's harmless. Blood does tend to make bonds stronger
[05:50:28] <Felis_> What, am I going to get banned for it Jrafnbjorn?
[05:50:59] <Hrafnbjorn> ya never know
[05:51:05] <Pores> scary o.o
[05:51:20] * DawnBat hands Hrafnbjorn boots and a spear
[05:51:35] <CantSirDraggin> we have tab autocomplete for nicks....type in the first couple letters of a nick and hit tab...
[05:52:05] <Hrafnbjorn> tab is our fingers' best friend
[05:52:09] <Felis_> Sorry its a habit to type things out manually
[05:52:19] <CantSirDraggin> makes saying things like Hrafnbjorn a lot easier, lol
[05:52:23] <Felis_> I just want to know if I have to stop because Im gonig to get banned for not being serious
[05:52:45] <SpiritSong> i would be lost without tab
[05:52:45] <CantSirDraggin> i get the idea that you might take a break for a bit
[05:53:09] <Hrafnbjorn> there shouldnt have to be a threat for you to stop, it was a request
[05:53:42] <DawnBat> I got muted inanother place for trying to lighten the atmosphere.
[05:53:46] <CantSirDraggin> i miss being an op some days
[05:54:00] <CantSirDraggin> warning once, kick once, then ban
[05:54:09] <Felis_> Im asking if its something I will get banned for
[05:54:10] <DawnBat> The Banhammer of Thor
[05:54:24] <DawnBat> Hrafnbjorn: Mjolnir is pretty much a banhammer right
[05:54:32] <CantSirDraggin> although almost never got past warning
[05:54:36] <Hrafnbjorn> where do folk think the line is regarding various cultures dragon type ideas?  Like is the Chinese version same as the East Euro, eyc....
[05:54:47] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah mjolnir bans all, lol
[05:54:59] <Felis_> Im asking so I can know if my behavior is bannable
[05:55:01] <DawnBat> also
[05:55:11] <DawnBat> was there dragons in Scandinavia
[05:55:19] <Hrafnbjorn> yes
[05:55:28] <DawnBat> ooooh
[05:55:31] <CantSirDraggin> as my nick suggests, i'm year of the dragon, but other than what it says about peeps from that year, i feel their idea of a dragon completely alien
[05:55:33] <Hrafnbjorn> there is Fafnir, and Nidhogg
[05:55:46] <Hrafnbjorn> plus Jormungandr is often thought of as a dragon
[05:55:53] <DawnBat> are any of them the child of Loki?
[05:55:55] <DawnBat> and omfg
[05:55:56] <MissSuugar> Dawn if you ever get the chance pick up the encyclopedia of spirits by judika illes
[05:55:59] <DawnBat> I just got mind blown
[05:56:03] <DawnBat> MissSuugar: Oh?
[05:56:07] <MissSuugar> honestly its worth getting it
[05:56:10] <Felis_> I just don't want to get banned is all .-.
[05:56:14] <DawnBat> My fiancees sign is the dragon
[05:56:19] <Felis_> Im sorry if its bad that Im asking .-.
[05:56:19] <Hrafnbjorn> Jormungandr is Loki's offspring with Angrbodha, yeah
[05:56:23] <SpiritSong> felis, sometimes execessing joking derails the convos
[05:56:28] <DawnBat> Anbrdoga?
[05:56:33] <DawnBat> wow butchered that
[05:56:43] <Pores> Felis, I think it's more about it being a request from a moderator than the behavior itself
[05:56:51] <SpiritSong> ^
[05:57:03] <Hrafnbjorn> Angrbodha, yeah... Odin also had child with her
[05:57:05] <CantSirDraggin> maybe a timing issue too, lol
[05:57:20] <DawnBat> ew
[05:57:22] <CantSirDraggin> odin may not have been picky, js
[05:57:34] <Felis_> Well sorry for ruining chat I guess
[05:57:41] <DawnBat> I need to find Rat-Dragon compatibilities
[05:57:56] <CantSirDraggin> rat...figures
[05:57:56] <Hrafnbjorn> he isnt portrayed as picky, no... 
[05:58:07] <North> remember that scene where Dany flew off on Drogon's back?
[05:58:11] <North> what the hell was that
[05:58:20] <DawnBat> "In business, Dragon takes the limelight while Rat manipulates everything from behind the scenes."
[05:58:47] <Pores> I think it's funny, Felis
[05:58:48] <DawnBat> I'm mostly confused as to why our relationship is so hard
[05:58:48] <CantSirDraggin> rat messes with the shiny hoarde, gets burned to a crisp
[05:59:00] <DawnBat> it
[05:59:06] <DawnBat> it's really stressful
[05:59:36] <SpiritSong> felis join in and chat with us
[05:59:46] <North> www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6ImW0XSmaw
[05:59:51] <CantSirDraggin> at what point did a muslim polytheist thing occur to you to be not stressful?
[05:59:59] <Felis_> I don't know anything about Dragons, so I can't really add in
[06:00:06] <DawnBat> that has nothing to do with it CantSirDraggin
[06:00:30] <DawnBat> it's mostly transportational, recreational and finanical
[06:01:13] <SpiritSong> well, ask questions if you like:) im sure peeps will be happy to answer
[06:01:15] <Hrafnbjorn> do you live in small town DawnBat?
[06:01:30] <DawnBat> Hrafnbjorn: Not exactly
[06:01:41] <Hrafnbjorn> I think the dragon topic died anyway
[06:01:47] <DawnBat> Population: 109,059 (2013)
[06:01:52] <Hrafnbjorn> is there public transpo?
[06:01:53] <Felis_> SpiritSong it really appears everyone has very different opinions on dragons os I dono how that'd work to ask questions
[06:02:03] <Pores> Rat seems to be similar to Water Cock. So I could possibly relate to dragon relationships, since my bro is a dragon
[06:02:24] <Felis_> Dragon relationships?
[06:02:40] <Hrafnbjorn> eastern astrology, Felis_
[06:02:41] <Pores> Dragon compatibility with other signs
[06:03:03] <Felis_> Ah okay 
[06:03:07] <Pores> Basically, dragon doesn't like underhandedness, so the flamboyantness of the cock is respected by the Dragon.
[06:03:16] <DawnBat> Hrafnbjorn: we both have too much anxiety for that
[06:03:22] <Pores> But water rooster makes it more subtle, and less flamboyant
[06:03:35] <Pores> As far as I know
[06:03:49] <Pores> The subtly works with the dragon by appealing to its emotional state
[06:03:52] <Pores> Basically
[06:04:08] <Pores> If you were to appeal to the dragon's self with underhandedness, you could have a compatible relationship
[06:04:24] <Pores> I'm a very watery rooster :P
[06:04:28] <DawnBat> I just am tired of not being able to see him very often
[06:04:39] <Pores> That's probably not his fault
[06:04:45] <Pores> Nor his intention
[06:04:55] <DawnBat> I know
[06:05:02] * North 's important dragon-related contribution is ignored
[06:05:13] <DawnBat> If I was to lose him though it'd bring my apathy levels to dangerous levels probably.
[06:05:21] <Pores> Sorry, I take the limelight often
[06:05:43] <Pores> When you see him, bring understanding and compassion
[06:05:53] <Pores> Connection and mutuality in general will help
[06:05:56] <Felis_> TFW never physically with my love
[06:05:58] <Felis_> Feels bad
[06:06:01] <Pores> Things you have in common, and opinions that are similar
[06:06:11] <DawnBat> Yes
[06:06:14] <Pores> Gosh, I am probably about to feel that, Felis
[06:06:24] <Felis_> Why is that Pores
[06:06:33] <DawnBat> I want to move in with him
[06:06:33] <Pores> I might be forming a long-distance relationship
[06:06:42] <Hrafnbjorn> how long have you guys been seeing eachother, DawnBat?
[06:07:08] <DawnBat> Hrafnbjorn: Over a year
[06:07:13] <Felis_> My partner lacks a physical body, so no matter what it'll never happen Pores :O
[06:07:17] <DawnBat> Longest relationship I have had
[06:08:28] <Pores> I could have potentially had a relationship like that, Felis_...
[06:08:32] <Pores> lol it didn't even ping
[06:08:48] <Felis_> it sucks
[06:08:55] <Felis_> But we make it work the best we can
[06:08:58] <Hrafnbjorn> I dont know how to say this without it sounding a bit rude, so I will just say it (just know its not meant to be rude, or hurtful)... at some point ya have to set dysfunctional behaviour, and hang-up aside if you want to make it work.  Either both, or one of you will have to do so
[06:08:59] <Pores> His name was SoduvVengahaw lol
[06:09:28] <DawnBat> Hrafnbjorn:  I don't understand exacrlt
[06:10:13] <Pores> I see, Felis_
[06:10:25] <Hrafnbjorn> those things like anxiety holding you back creates dysfunctional behaviour, and relationships.  Th only way to get past that is to get past the thing causing it (like the anxiety)
[06:10:35] <DawnBat> True
[06:10:42] <DawnBat> That's just mostly for the transportation
[06:10:47] <Pores> I think a lot of anxiety when it comes to relationships is worrying
[06:11:00] <Pores> Worrying about things that didn't even happen
[06:11:17] <Hrafnbjorn> or you could spend 9 nights chanting the ass runes song
[06:11:22] <DawnBat> what
[06:11:26] <Hrafnbjorn> but thats not likely to work ;)
[06:11:41] <DawnBat> What is that
[06:11:59] <Hrafnbjorn> ass runes song (from Havamal):
[06:12:06] <Hrafnbjorn> A fourth I know, if men shall fasten bonds on my bended legs; so great is the charm, that forth I may go, the fetters spring from my feet, broken the bonds from my hands.
[06:12:06] * North misread that as 'ruins'
[06:12:18] <DawnBat> fun
[06:12:29] <Hrafnbjorn> but youd have to chant it in original language, cause thats where the galdr is
[06:12:32] <Pores> DawnBat, if you guys end up moving in, I recommend sitting comfortably on top of eachother, rather than trying to make eachother's space
[06:12:37] <Hrafnbjorn> original language would be:
[06:12:50] <Hrafnbjorn> be a bit harder
[06:13:29] <Pores> I was in a relationship with a fellow Cock, and we loved sitting ontop of eachother. The thing is, though, that we didn't like it when our egos or images were tested (which is like duh)
[06:13:52] <Hrafnbjorn> BUT if you want the original language version, I will gladly type it out
[06:14:06] <Pores> When we made distance, we wondered why our relationship was failing. I know why now :P
[06:14:10] <DawnBat> I have to brb for a moment. Have to move spots and make tea

[06:14:18] <Pores> We were young though, so it's excusable
[06:14:42] <Pores> Gosh, I should except my inner Cock more often
[06:14:43] <Pores> this is fun
[06:14:47] <Pores> accept*
[06:14:50] <Pores> Why did I even make that typo
[06:15:24] <Felis_> I've accepted my inner cat O:
[06:15:29] <Felis_> But thats generally a bad thing
[06:15:35] <Pores> Omg I've never accepted my inner cat
[06:15:46] <Pores> doing so will be very difficult at first
[06:15:53] <Pores> But yeah it is generally a bad thing haha
[06:15:58] <Pores> I've accepted my inner female fox

[06:16:03] <Pores> ;3
[06:16:08] <Pores> Almost
[06:16:30] <Pores> Accepting your inner cat gives you all kinds of behaviors
[06:16:37] <Pores> All are harmless, and weird, but some can find it offensive
[06:17:47] <North> e.g. taking a dump on someone's rug
[06:17:54] <MissSuugar> LOL
[06:18:01] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[06:18:08] <Felis_> Yeah people don't like how I act when Im myself
[06:18:11] <Felis_> so I generally don't
[06:18:14] <Felis_> but idc atm
[06:18:22] <Felis_> But I stopped the /me pet thing
[06:18:29] <Felis_> because that made people angry
[06:19:11] <Pores> Just don't mind them unless they put you in a situation you don't like
[06:19:29] <Pores> I'm accepting my inner dimensional clam atm. It's very strange
[06:19:43] <Felis_> Okie
[06:19:46] <Felis_> Thats strange
[06:19:50] <Pores> It is strange.
[06:19:54] <Felis_> Inner cat is because I am cat
[06:19:56] <Felis_> ez pz logic
[06:19:59] <Pores> yeah
[06:20:02] <Pores> very simple :3
[06:20:17] <Pores> I've brought out people's inner stuff before. Groupwide
[06:20:19] <Pores> It's fun <3

[06:56:37] <Hrafnbjorn> wb DawnBatGuano
[06:56:45] <DawnBatGuano> thank you
[06:56:58] <DawnBatGuano> is thre any aspect of Mother, Maiden Crone in Norse
[06:57:54] <Hrafnbjorn> sorta, there are the Nornir... Urd (that which was) Verdandi (that which is) and Skuld (that which should be)
[06:58:12] <DawnBatGuano> sounds kinda spooky
[06:58:29] <DawnBatGuano> reminds me of Ghosts of Past, Present and Future
[06:58:32] <Hrafnbjorn> they are 3 giantess that weave the actions of gods and men into their fate
[06:59:43] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ah, yes. The Norns
[07:00:06] <DawnBatGuano> well
[07:00:13] <DawnBatGuano> sounds kind of powerful
[07:00:47] <Hrafnbjorn> I suppose there is power there, however they dont (in theory) manipulate those fates
[07:01:31] <DawnBatGuano> ahhh

[07:03:12] <Abraxas> Welcome, AntleredGirl. In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
[07:03:14] <Hrafnbjorn> and Im not sure they COULD manipulate the fates since they are taking what was and what is, and intruducing it into the cosmos
[07:03:27] <Hrafnbjorn> they dont have a 'look'
[07:03:28] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa AntleredGirl!
[07:03:37] <AntleredGirl> Hidee!
[07:03:42] <DawnBatGuano> well shape or form and such
[07:04:21] <Hrafnbjorn> in some cases they are beastly, like Fenris and Jormungandr, other times they are same appearance as the Aesir (Odin is a giant in the beginning after all)
[07:04:49] <Hrafnbjorn> the different mythic being are more like 'states of being' than actual races
[07:04:50] <DawnBatGuano> oh
[07:05:12] <DawnBatGuano> I just thought since the word giant was used was that they'd be huge
[07:05:38] <Hrafnbjorn> in some cases they are
[07:05:45] <DawnBatGuano> ah
[07:05:51] <North> hi ho, Molly-o
[07:06:15] <DawnBatGuano> a girl...with antlers
[07:06:31] <DawnBatGuano> are you a Wacraft Dryad? :P
[07:06:33] <Hrafnbjorn> an example is when Thor wanted to cross the river Grid but there was a giantess straddling the river valley, urinating to make the river... she was obviously huge
[07:06:47] <DawnBatGuano> well that's kinda gross
[07:06:51] <North> not just any girl with antlers
[07:06:57] <North> *the* girl with antlers
[07:06:59] * North nods
[07:07:04] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, I suppose... but its all symbol IMO
[07:07:08] <DawnBatGuano> true
[07:07:24] <DawnBatGuano> not as gross or odd as some Kemetic stories
[07:09:09] <Hrafnbjorn> good and evil are not really part of Germanic mythology, so the difference between giant and god is more about whether they are helpful (a gift deserves a gift in return) or if they are greedy/destructive/self-centered, etc
[07:09:31] <DawnBatGuano> ahhhh
[07:09:34] <DawnBatGuano> Order and Chaos?
[07:09:44] <Hrafnbjorn> sorta, yeah
[07:09:54] <DawnBatGuano> also
[07:09:58] <Hrafnbjorn> many of the gods are chaotic too though
[07:10:09] <DawnBatGuano> Atum (maker of the universe) was referred to as The Great He-She
[07:10:13] <DawnBatGuano> Oh alright
[07:10:23] <Hrafnbjorn> Odin, for example, is the Germanic equivelent of the trickster god, and he is rather chaotic
[07:10:40] <DawnBatGuano> but he seems like such a nice guy
[07:10:43] <DawnBatGuano> well sometimes
[07:10:51] <Hrafnbjorn> *sometimes
[07:11:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I thought that was Loki, Hrafnbjorn
[07:11:17] <Hrafnbjorn> one of his heiti is Bolverk (strife-bringer)
[07:11:28] <DawnBatGuano> wasn't he kind of a Fatherly Figure?
[07:11:42] <Hrafnbjorn> Loki isnt one of the gods, and his actions were less about trickery, more about sabotage
[07:11:49] <North> well, gunnite
[07:11:50] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ah
[07:11:52] <Hrafnbjorn> yes Odin is the fatherly figure
[07:11:59] *** Parts: North (North@sorcery-3ur0ed.dsl.bell.ca) ("")
[07:12:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Hence "Odin, the All Father"
[07:12:54] <Hrafnbjorn> Loki was good at being trickster when he wanted to, but vast majority of his actions were meant to harm, not to teach, hence him not fitting the 'trickster' archetype
[07:13:14] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ok
[07:14:52] <Hrafnbjorn> he did, however, have the opportunity to become one of the Aesir, but he chose to work against them instead, but from the inside, so he was like a spy in the hall

[07:15:22] <DawnBatGuano> was there any form of time travel or mention of it
[07:15:39] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> He got what he deserved, at Ragnarok, according to the book I read.
[07:15:48] <Hrafnbjorn> no, time travel i impossible in the Heathen concept of time
[07:15:58] <DawnBatGuano> ah
[07:16:20] <DawnBatGuano> what's passed is passed?
[07:16:22] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> According to that book, all the Frost Giants and Gods except for one, died.
[07:16:29] <Hrafnbjorn> time travel requires linear time... they believed in cyclical time, plus they viewed 2 different 'times'
[07:16:55] <Hrafnbjorn> several of the gods survive, and Balder is reborn
[07:17:00] <DawnBatGuano> oh
[07:17:07] <Hrafnbjorn> 2 humans survive as well, Lif and Lifthrasir
[07:17:18] <DawnBatGuano> lucky them
[07:17:21] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ah, then that book was a bit off, then.
[07:17:24] <DawnBatGuano> But they have to repopulate I fuess
[07:17:30] <Hrafnbjorn> or "Life" and "Will to live"
[07:17:42] <DawnBatGuano> wait cylindrical?
[07:17:48] <DawnBatGuano> So everything keeps repeating?
[07:18:03] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, but not in identical form

[07:19:12] <DawnBatGuano> heart was probably unecassary
[07:19:20] <Hrafnbjorn> plus there is 2 axis... one is like our modern concept of time, which follows a horizontal flow axis on Yggdrasil, the other is the time cycle that the soul follows in rebirth, which is the verticle axis on Yggdrasil
[07:19:28] <DawnBatGuano> oh
[07:19:33] <DawnBatGuano> X and Y?
[07:19:43] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah
[07:19:57] <DawnBatGuano> so Yggdrasil is in a sense 3D
[07:20:26] <Hrafnbjorn> yep. it is the world tree that is the structure of the cosmos
[07:20:50] <DawnBatGuano> kinda based my worlds off of that
[07:21:06] <Hrafnbjorn> litteraly "Ygg's Gallows"  Yggr was one of Odins names, meaning 'terrible'
[07:21:15] <DawnBatGuano> oh my
[07:22:43] <DawnBatGuano> I alsways liked the world tree
[07:23:08] <Hrafnbjorn> me too
[07:23:37] <DawnBatGuano> i'be seen some depictions that show rivers at the roots
[07:24:40] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, there are 3 wells which is where knowledge, wisdom, as well as the 'new' fate flows into the 9 worlds
[07:24:49] <DawnBatGuano> ahhhhhhh
[07:24:57] <DawnBatGuano> oh btw
[07:25:05] <DawnBatGuano> Niflheim sounds realllll depressing
[07:25:09] <Hrafnbjorn> wells are the door between the hidden and the seen
[07:25:29] <DawnBatGuano> ooooh
[07:25:34] <DawnBatGuano> I should get one
[07:25:42] <Hrafnbjorn> Niflheim is intense depression, yeah.... it is pure contraction
[07:25:57] <DawnBatGuano> Also!
[07:26:05] <DawnBatGuano> Is there any aspect of a phoenix in a way?
[07:26:30] <Hrafnbjorn> its counter balance being Muspelsheim, which is pure expanssion... its emotional aspect is rage, anger, destructiveness, etc...
[07:27:05] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, hard to say about the pheonix thing, since many beings are reborn
[07:27:10] <DawnBatGuano> True
[07:28:00] <Hrafnbjorn> Freyja is a good example... when she first went to the Aesir, she called herself Gullveig (gold-gready) and the Aesir burned her 3 times.. after the third time she was transformed
[07:28:35] <Hrafnbjorn> the general rule in their rebirth concept is that bones must stay intact
[07:28:52] <DawnBatGuano> ahhh
[07:29:06] <DawnBatGuano> worlds first witch-burning? :
[07:29:15] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[07:29:19] <DawnBatGuano> fun
[07:29:48] <Hrafnbjorn> after 3rd burning, she became Heidh (Shinning) and it is said she became the friend to witches
[07:30:10] <DawnBatGuano> hmmm
[07:30:12] <DawnBatGuano> Intriguing
[07:30:25] <Hrafnbjorn> one area neo-paganism, and comparative myth gets her wrong is calling her a love goddess
[07:30:40] <Hrafnbjorn> her experience with love was not what we would desire
[07:30:52] <DawnBatGuano> ohhh
[07:30:54] <Hrafnbjorn> it is lost love, prostitution, lust, etc....
[07:31:05] <DawnBatGuano> oh my
[07:31:08] <Hrafnbjorn> and incest
[07:31:54] <DawnBatGuano> yeah, that's common amongst most ancient lore
[07:32:05] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[07:32:16] <DawnBatGuano> Egypt especially
[07:32:53] <Hrafnbjorn> she was part of the very very old (pre-historical) Alcis concept... another example is the Greek Cleopatras
[07:33:10] <DawnBatGuano> ohhhhhh
[07:34:04] <Hrafnbjorn> Freyja 'married' her twin brother.... all the Cleopatra's had to marry their brother as well. The last Cleopatra (the one we usualy speak about) broke out of that by assassinating her brother
[07:34:57] <Hrafnbjorn> of course with the Cleopatra's, it was coming from Greek tradition rather than Egyptian, even though the last one was an Egyptian ruler
[07:35:04] <DawnBatGuano> yeh
[07:35:16] <DawnBatGuano> there's evidence the last Cleopatra had more african traits I believe
[07:35:27] <Hrafnbjorn> they were from the Ptolemi line which is Greek
[07:35:39] <DawnBatGuano> oh
[07:35:49] <Hrafnbjorn> the coins and statues depict her with very Greek features
[07:35:51] <DawnBatGuano> well we probably won't know fully until we find her darn body
[07:36:52] <Hrafnbjorn> there is an acress that looks exactly like how Cleopatra is portrayed, but I cannot remember her name right now
[07:37:17] <DawnBatGuano> Mata Hari? :P
[07:37:37] * Hrafnbjorn shrugs
[07:37:49] <Hrafnbjorn> I think she is a Brittish actor
[07:38:38] <DawnBatGuano> what nationality are you mostly btw?
[07:42:50] <Hrafnbjorn> Swedish and Danish
[07:42:59] <DawnBatGuano> ah fun
