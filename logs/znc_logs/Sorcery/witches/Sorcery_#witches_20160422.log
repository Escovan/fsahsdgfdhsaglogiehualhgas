[00:00:51] <North> an excellent choice
[00:02:33] <North> <Black Forest Cake>  "Fun fact: I go well with coffee."
[00:02:36] <North> noted!
[00:04:08] <SpiritSong> black forest is divine
[00:05:23] <MissSugar> fun fact it goes well with midnight snacks
[00:05:33] <North> lol
[00:05:37] <North> oh, I can believe it
[00:06:18] <MissSugar> ok little story for the day, my stepdad use to make a shit ton of noise in the kitchen when he would get his midnight snacks, like he thought as soon as he got there it was sound proof or something
[00:06:42] <North> hm
[00:07:04] <MissSugar> so my sister and i would wait until he got half way through getting his snack which was usually cake or ice cream and we would rub our eyes and say sleeply "what are you doing"
[00:07:10] <MissSugar> and he fell for it every time
[00:07:16] <North> hahaha
[00:07:20] <North> cunning
[00:07:21] <MissSugar> and would just give us what ever he was making
[00:07:32] <North> win/win

[01:18:16] <Isidore> does meaning-of-name.com ever provide last names?

[03:16:29] <Abraxas> Welcome, raevynskyyemt. Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.
[03:16:42] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> hey, raevynskyyemt
[03:16:43] <raevynskyyemt> Hi everyone 
[03:16:55] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa raevynskyyemt!
[03:17:07] <bonzaibanana> Hallo!
[03:18:05] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> brb
[03:18:26] <raevynskyyemt> Guess what I got in loot Crate today :D
[03:19:33] <raevynskyyemt> No one's going to guess? 
[03:20:11] <raevynskyyemt> Fine. I got a horn cup replica
[03:20:40] <raevynskyyemt> From vikings
[03:21:29] <Hrafnbjorn> sorry, was away cooking dinner
[03:22:13] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> back
[03:22:21] <Hrafnbjorn> kinda defeats the purpose if its not cow horn...
[03:22:34] <Hrafnbjorn> but cool none the less I suppose
[03:23:00] <raevynskyyemt> Can you imagine the outrage from Peta I'd it were real? 
[03:23:11] <raevynskyyemt> If not I'd 
[03:23:55] <Hrafnbjorn> most domestic cows have theirs removed, so its not a trophy item from killing them
[03:24:31] <Hrafnbjorn> and it grows back anyhow
[03:24:33] <raevynskyyemt> I know. But I think they were trying to avoid contoversy
[03:24:37] <North> hey there, raevynskyyemt 
[03:25:52] <Hrafnbjorn> easy enough to make if ya ever choose to... just buy the horn (around $20) and soak the inside with vodka, or similar hard alcohol
[03:26:16] <North> hmm....apparently the artist formerly known as Prince is dead
[03:26:36] <Hrafnbjorn> Tandy Leather also sells a coating for inside that totaly seals it, and makes it dishwasher safe
[03:26:37] <raevynskyyemt> But they lie about sheep shearing being painful for the sheep. It was easier to mass produce plastic
[03:26:47] <raevynskyyemt> So did Chyna 
[03:29:36] <North> yeah, I guess I don't really care about the Prince thing all that much either
[03:29:39] <raevynskyyemt> And the mention of her kills the chat

[03:30:08] <Hrafnbjorn> I dunno who Chyna is
[03:30:08] <raevynskyyemt> I liked prince. But I've never been much of a fan
[03:30:14] <North> same
[03:30:19] <raevynskyyemt> A female wrestler hraf
[03:30:24] <North> some stuff off Purple Rain was okay
[03:30:43] <Hrafnbjorn> ah, that would explain it then, lol
[03:32:27] <raevynskyyemt> She was popular in the 90s. Before wrestling became predictable and boring
[03:34:13] <raevynskyyemt> Anyway.... 
[03:34:25] <Hrafnbjorn> wait... it was once unpredictable and not boring?
[03:34:48] <North> inconceivable

[03:44:23] <Witchit> FINALLY OH MY GOD
[03:44:28] <North> G3
[03:44:34] <Witchit> Yo :)
[03:44:42] <North> how's the night in Witchitville?
[03:44:49] <Witchit> I have been up to my arms in work
[03:45:02] <Witchit> On the bright side, I have 3 commissions
[03:45:07] <Witchit> On the downside, WORK
[03:45:31] <North> BUT COMMISSIONS
[03:45:36] <Witchit> I KNOW RIGHT :D
[03:45:36] * North needlessly reminds
[03:45:40] <North> ;)
[03:45:42] <North> congrats
[03:45:58] <Witchit> I'm so excited! They're all from the same person, but he's given me so much joy
[03:46:09] <North> that's awesome
[03:46:12] <Witchit> He's asked for like 3 commissions beforehand
[03:46:26] <Witchit> And now he wants two bags and pixel art
[03:46:37] <Witchit> I'm pretty happy :D
[03:46:42] <Witchit> Except WORK
[03:46:47] <North> keep that gravy train a-rollin', same person
[03:47:03] <Witchit> He's a great guy...those 3 commissions cost him 300
[03:47:11] <Witchit> And he didn't even care 0_o
[03:47:15] <North> worth every penny
[03:47:21] <Witchit> :)
[03:48:07] <Witchit> I am pretty confident in my skills now :P
[03:48:38] <North> fruits of a pattern of success
[03:48:54] <Witchit> For now, yes ^ ^
[03:49:18] <Witchit> I hope this keeps up, because I'm REALLY excited to be working
[03:49:31] <Witchit> Except for homework. :P
[03:49:51] * North irresponsibly throws the books on the fire
[03:49:54] <Witchit> -shakes fist at education system-
[03:49:55] <North> \o/
[03:49:57] <Witchit> XD
[03:50:10] <Witchit> I was tempted to actually do that freshman year
[03:50:16] <North> understandably
[03:50:35] <Witchit> I got like 7 books for my seminar and then he said 'we're only using 3'
[03:50:36] <North> that kind of stuff is practically BEGGING for fire
[03:50:44] <North> what the what
[03:50:50] <North> those things aren't cheap    :/
[03:50:55] <Witchit> THAT SHTUFF COST LIKE 500
[03:50:58] <Witchit> AOIGNEGNGEU
[03:51:10] <North> jeez louise
[03:51:17] <North> maddening
[03:51:26] <Witchit> (Probably less, but that's the amount I remember)
[03:51:39] <North> way overpriced, those things
[03:51:50] <Witchit> Oh god yes, I was so mad
[03:52:07] <Witchit> I remember it cost more than my art supplies, which cost 200
[03:52:14] * North nods
[03:52:48] <Witchit> I wanted so bad to throw my books in the fire, but I didn't
[03:52:50] <North> maybe you could get, like, half back
[03:52:59] <North> (re-selling)
[03:53:12] <Witchit> Maybe..they're not in as good as a condition
[03:53:32] <Witchit> *good of a
[03:53:41] <North> well....something back, at least
[03:53:47] <Witchit> Eh, hope so
[03:53:59] <Witchit> I might just do book art with them cuz whatever
[03:54:21] * North nods whateverishly
[03:54:26] <Witchit> But they're basically useless
[03:54:41] <North> what commission are you currently working on?
[03:55:30] <Witchit> I made a bag recently and showed the guy, and he loved it so much he wanted two (one for his fiance) and then asked for a surprise gift for her, which is a Little Mermaid pixel art background
[03:55:46] <Witchit> I'm throwing in book art for free :)
[03:55:57] <North> haha, nice
[03:56:37] <Witchit> He's been nothing but the kindest man to me, the least I can do is repay him and give him like this huge discount and throw in a free thingy
[03:57:17] <North> that's some fine customer service, right there
[03:57:40] <North> not putting the sexy moves on you, is he?
[03:58:03] <Witchit> Hahahaha, nah. He's dedicated to his lady love, and loves me and my bf together :)
[03:58:11] <North> bonus
[03:58:18] <Witchit> He's just a really nice guy ^ ^
[03:58:33] <Witchit> But what about you? How are you?
[03:58:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Hey, Witchit
[03:58:55] <North> I've had a slight headache all day
[03:59:20] <Witchit> Hi ArchrWndrMcRbrt :D
[03:59:30] <Witchit> Aw, feel better North!
[03:59:42] <North> K!
[03:59:56] * North brings his will to bear
[04:00:11] <Witchit> Go to bed early and take medicine if you have any :)
[04:00:16] <Witchit> That's what helps me
[04:00:29] <North> I like that first suggestion
[04:00:53] <North> the second one is mighty tempting, although I try to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary
[04:01:26] <North> not out of any lofty principle, incidentally
[04:01:34] <North> it just seems to rot my gut
[04:01:43] <Witchit> Do what you want, it's not for everyone ^ ^
[04:02:02] <North> no word of a lie, my friend
[04:02:20] <Witchit> Sometimes I take medication to fall asleep if I have a hard cold or headache
[04:02:31] <Witchit> It could also be dehydration
[04:02:50] <North> no dismissing the importance of sleep
[04:03:23] <Witchit> Yep. Also, drink a lot of water....it helps when you have a headache because you could be dehydrated
[04:03:40] <North> good advice
[04:03:44] <North> (been doing that)
[04:03:48] <Witchit> Oh, good
[04:03:52] <Witchit> Just checking
[04:03:52] <North> :)
[04:03:58] <North> yep
[04:04:16] <North> just one of those things, I guess
[04:04:21] <Witchit> My grandma fainted once because of dehydration, so I like to pass on advice
[04:04:28] <North> yikes

[04:04:55] <North> do you drink water (or any other fluid) with meals?
[04:05:42] <Witchit> I do, especially water. Sometimes I add in flavoring just in case I want an unhealthy drink....the flavoring's at least a little better than Gatorade
[04:06:03] <raevynskyyemt> I do. It makes me feel fuller

[04:07:16] <Iona> hello raevynskyyemt 
[04:07:21] <North> I'd heard that it undermines digestion, you see....but lately O BUT LATELY...
[04:07:33] <North> I've heard that it HELPS digestion!
[04:07:38] <Witchit> Pffff
[04:07:42] <MissSugar> well give it a try
[04:07:47] <North> I sure will
[04:07:48] <Witchit> Hi MissSugar :)
[04:07:51] <raevynskyyemt> I've heard you're supposed to drink an hour before eating. But that's crazy talk 
[04:07:57] <North> lol
[04:08:03] <Witchit> That seems like an old wives' tale
[04:08:08] <MissSugar> hey Witchit 
[04:08:15] <Witchit> I think they meant swimming too
[04:08:17] <North> neither of you have experienced any digestive troubles, I take it?
[04:08:18] <Witchit> Or exercising
[04:08:25] <Witchit> I have like once
[04:08:36] <North> from drinking while eating, I mean
[04:08:38] <raevynskyyemt> No North. Not that I've noticed anyway 
[04:08:44] <Witchit> Oh
[04:08:45] <North> interesing....
[04:08:50] <Witchit> Nah
[04:09:03] * North nods thoughtfully
[04:09:05] <Witchit> I doubt that's true. Plus, water helps break down the food
[04:09:10] <North> wow....all these years
[04:09:18] <North> that makes sense
[04:09:32] <Witchit> Well who knows :) Maybe your body is different
[04:09:45] <Witchit> There could be people out there who work differently
[04:09:57] <North> bioindividuality certainly is a thing
[04:10:04] <raevynskyyemt> Our ancestors evolved to different parts of the world. What's true for one may be false for another
[04:10:10] <Witchit> Especially people who are allergic to the sun
[04:10:13] <North> aye
[04:10:14] <Witchit> Which I STILL don't get
[04:10:25] <raevynskyyemt> Or allergic to water
[04:10:30] <North> !
[04:10:36] <Witchit> Yeah, that's pretty odd
[04:10:39] <North> tantamount to an allergy to Life
[04:10:57] <North> what are the symptoms of a water allergy?
[04:10:57] <Witchit> Body: Hey, do you like surviving? TOO BAD
[04:11:02] <North> lol
[04:11:03] <raevynskyyemt> Death sentence until recently
[04:11:10] <North> :o
[04:11:13] <Witchit> Death by water
[04:11:17] <Witchit> GENIUS
[04:11:21] <North> lunacy
[04:11:28] <Witchit> My God body, how do you do it?!
[04:11:33] <Witchit> Body: It's a living.
[04:11:39] <North> oho
[04:11:44] <North> I see what you did there, Body
[04:11:51] <Witchit> Body: You're welcome
[04:12:03] <North> always good to hear from Body
[04:12:05] * North nods
[04:12:06] <Witchit> XD
[04:12:19] <Witchit> I really hope Body doesn't become a reoccuring character
[04:12:26] <North> time will tell
[04:12:51] <Witchit> I also love that the character has no name, just 'Body'
[04:13:03] <North> aptly named
[04:13:10] <North> or...not-named
[04:13:14] <Witchit> At least it's not like Shaniqua
[04:13:21] <North> lol
[04:13:25] <Witchit> Or North-West o3o

[04:13:44] <Witchit> North, I understand your username, YOURS is fine
[04:13:58] <Witchit> But actually naming a kid after a pun
[04:14:05] <North> drugs
[04:14:09] * North conjectures
[04:14:13] <Witchit> Never enough for that name
[04:14:28] <North> what a world

[04:15:21] <North> please tell me that isn't an actual name
[04:15:32] <Witchit> It is. It really, really is.

[04:17:50] <Witchit> *some people
[04:17:59] <MissSugar> agreed raevynskyyemt 
[04:18:05] * North patpats the exceptional American
[04:18:07] <raevynskyyemt> I'm an American. But its getting ridiculous. 
[04:18:24] <Witchit> Well Trump supporters I don't get, but I think that's it :/
[04:18:26] <MissSugar> the no teeth in the south kinda crazy
[04:18:42] <Witchit> I guess it's different because I live in the north part
[04:19:38] <Witchit> Trump himself is horrible, but at least Bernie is ahead, and I respect certain Americans who have really been great to me
[04:20:06] <North> I like most of the Americans I've spoken with
[04:20:20] <Witchit> That's great North :)
[04:20:25] *** izumi is now known as Isidore

[04:20:37] <Isidore> Isidore from earlier here, earlier I mentioned I want to change my name and was interested in knowing what are some last names which refer to the moon, moon deities, or Harvest Moon might be
[04:20:41] <MissSugar> i agree with DAnile Tosh when he said "America is number 1, to people who havent traveled much"

[04:21:28] <Witchit> Eh, I disagree....there are actually worse countries out there
[04:21:51] <North> the average citizen certainly can't be held responsible for it's country's foreign policy
[04:22:28] <Witchit> Yeah, I hate it when people generalize me because I'm American
[04:22:41] <Witchit> They're like "You should be 50 lbs. heavier"
[04:23:14] <Witchit> Someone said to me at a camp "Where did you hide the guns?"
[04:23:30] <Witchit> I laughed, but inside it kind of hurt
[04:24:25] <MissSugar> but why do you put your identity on the same place as you put where you were born?
[04:25:08] <Witchit> It's a bit like patriotism, but not as harmful. I am affected by where I live, and I'm happy to say I'm American
[04:25:19] <Witchit> I am also skeptical
[04:25:33] <Witchit> I know there are bad things about it, but I also know there's a lot of hope
[04:25:37] <MissSugar> why though? it doesnt make any sense
[04:25:49] <MissSugar> where you were born doesnt dictate who you are as a person
[04:25:57] <Witchit> I never said it did
[04:26:07] <Witchit> But it is a piece of me
[04:26:07] <MissSugar> but you did
[04:26:11] <MissSugar> its really not
[04:26:23] <Witchit> I apologize if there was a miscommunication
[04:26:42] <Witchit> Where you live can affect you though. Not the whole way though
[04:26:54] <North> we're all products of our culture, to some degree
[04:26:59] <Witchit> Exactly
[04:27:04] <Witchit> Culture is pretty huge
[04:27:06] <North> inescapably
[04:28:36] <Witchit> Also think of it like Japan. Japan has a huge culture with people who are affected every day by the social norms, and are raised to love their country a lot more than America
[04:29:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> You guys are gonna love this one!

[06:35:26] <Guest> Hell, we praise people that we send overseas to blow other people up. How would one remove violence from a theology if 04the times praise it?
[06:36:21] <Hrafnbjorn> you cant, nor should you remove it totaly, just in cases where classical cultures had an obsession with it, we, today, have to view violence, its needs, its consequences, and such in our terms.   The reasons and such recorded in lore do not speak to our times today
[06:36:50] <Hrafnbjorn> we are not obsessed with it today like folk used to be

[06:37:31] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa Alusa_!
[06:37:40] <Guest> I'd propose that we are obsessed with violence. Television is a good example. War is common, these days.
[06:37:58] <Hrafnbjorn> war is far less common, and far lessleathal today
[06:38:13] <Hrafnbjorn> still perhaps TOO common, just not like it used to be
[06:38:21] <Hrafnbjorn> depending on culture too of course
[06:38:41] <Guest> What happened long ago with regard to war and violence, and how those story's were told, is not different from 04the way to do it today. It's just packed differently. <-- what say you
[06:39:02] <Hrafnbjorn> it is different in its impact
[06:39:15] <Guest> How so
[06:39:19] <Guest> What scope
[06:39:37] <Hrafnbjorn> it used to be a winning army kept 25% of its souls, the loosing lost 99%... today we dont even loose 1%
[06:40:19] <Guest> True; technology has shifted 04the numbers, but violence is still violence
[06:40:36] <Hrafnbjorn> yes violence is still violence
[06:41:06] <Hrafnbjorn> but the focus of those comments was the scope, not the philosophy
[06:41:35] <Guest> And I'd propose that what's happening in 04the Middle East is pretty much a genocide. Hundreds of thousands have died since "The West" started its wars
[06:42:14] <Guest> So while we might have only lost 1%, 04the other side has lost quite a bit more than 1%
[06:42:24] <Hrafnbjorn> Im not gonna discuss the mod east, sorry

[06:43:00] <Guest> Fair enough
[06:43:06] <Hrafnbjorn> to easy for folk that were not there to talk out their necks with BS, and I dont really wanna participate in it
[06:44:29] <Guest> Id' only seriously consider a Middle East citizen as being an authority. I'd never assume a paid mercenary was fit to speak about such things
[06:45:02] <Guest> ---> That's 04the rub
[06:45:41] <Guest> That's 03your Heathenism repackaged. It takes a lot of thinking about, but that's 04the core of 04the problem
[06:45:56] <Hrafnbjorn> ?
[06:46:04] <Guest> How to take it apart and set it right? I am still working on that
[06:46:08] <Hrafnbjorn> what is my Heathenism repackaged?
[06:46:15] <Guest> The great divide
[06:46:40] <Guest> The great differences between how we all see 04the world. What's important? 
[06:46:45] <Hrafnbjorn> it doesnt need to be set right, just understood in modern terms
[06:47:34] <Hrafnbjorn> the same thing happened during the Heathen period... things had to be understood in context of social and cultural changes
[06:48:38] <Hrafnbjorn> good examples are the transition of popularity of deities, funeral practices, and in case of Iceland, how a 'divine king' fits into a society with no king
[06:49:33] <Hrafnbjorn> today, we still have to confrot the divine king paradigm, but also slavery, as it was a spiritual paradigm in Vendel and Viking Period Heathenism
[06:50:04] <Guest> The New testiment
[06:50:11] <Guest> In other words
[06:50:16] <Hrafnbjorn> not slavery like what occured in north and south America, but slavery none-the=less
[06:50:48] <Hrafnbjorn> no, not a reformation
[06:53:13] <Hrafnbjorn> reformation is a necessity for institutionalized religion... Heathenism has never been institutionalized, so it doesnt need reformation.  It just requires contemplation on certain aspects to understand them, so we understand just what WAS being said, and how that fits into our lives today
[06:53:26] <Guest> For sure, it will be these ideas that save 04the world, probably quite literally, but right now, I'd say it has all been hijacked
[06:53:40] <Hrafnbjorn> even where Heathen sects are state sponsored, its not institutionalized
[06:54:01] <Guest> Was there ever a book, like a bible?
[06:54:22] <Guest> Or great early leaders that left famous quotes on 04the ethics?
[06:54:29] <Guest> (Heathen leaders)
[06:54:32] <Hrafnbjorn> it is the largest religion, by far with regards to lore, but there is no book like a Bible, no
[06:54:57] <Hrafnbjorn> sure, there are sagas with ethical teachings
[06:55:58] <Hrafnbjorn> but there is no institution to force anything... where it does gove ethical instruction it is in the for of  "one should do this or that" instead of "you must do this or that"
[06:56:09] <Hrafnbjorn> *form

[19:40:41] <TheAllison> it's been crazy trying to wrap my mind around that little girl being a full grown adult, it's like getting to know each other allllll over again
[19:46:35] <SpiritSong> must have been hard when ye were out of contaxt
[19:50:06] <TheAllison> we had each other on facebook, but to be honest the lack of contact was probably best for them so they could readjust to living with their mother again and getting to know her new beau
[19:50:46] <TheAllison> not that we were cut off completely, but the space helped them adjust to being there instead of missing here
