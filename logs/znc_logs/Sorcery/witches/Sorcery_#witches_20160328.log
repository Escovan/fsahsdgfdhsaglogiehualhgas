[04:29:17] <SpiritSong> what happened?
[04:29:34] <Keitherino> i had 2 individual energy surges.
[04:30:25] <Keitherino> kinda like what you can get when you get a cold chill... but these were diffreent
[04:30:33] <Keitherino> different
[04:31:39] <Keitherino> though NOrth... if you wish to come out west and visit you are more than welcome :)
[04:31:44] <Keitherino> North even
[04:31:46] <SpiritSong> what did they feel like
[04:32:35] <Keitherino> it felt like pressure built up inside my body.  through my arms, legs, chest, and head.  just a pushing outwards
[04:32:40] <North> a kind offer
[04:32:54] <Keitherino> of course.... and I'll make sure to have chili for you :)

[04:35:39] <Keitherino> i dont know.....though i was watching  a show on tv about predictions of catastrophic events
[04:36:00] <Keitherino> and it isn't the first time it has happened when i have thought of the subject
[04:41:46] <SpiritSong> sorry keith i ran to brish my teeth
[04:41:59] <SpiritSong> what happened last time you had that experience?
[04:42:46] <SpiritSong> i mean, did something happen after
[04:42:58] <Keitherino> it was the same thing... like a build up of pressure, then it dissipates quickly
[04:43:18] <Keitherino> the situation of what was happening i cant recal... was quite a while ago
[04:44:29] <SpiritSong> before a tragic world event though?
[04:44:35] <SpiritSong> what emotions comewith it
[04:45:14] <Keitherino> honestly I can't recall.  it wasn't really emotional.  just intense
[04:45:57] <SpiritSong> nods
[04:46:13] <CantSirDraggin> he exploded, it was messy, took him all night to regenerate
[04:46:24] <SpiritSong> he's not dr who

[04:46:27] <SpiritSong> lol
[04:46:32] <Keitherino> lol... it was that final mint leaf

[04:48:08] <North> I've been in my pajamas, or what passes for them, all the live long day

[04:48:37] <Keitherino> good man...nothing is more comfortable, than being comfortable
[04:48:49] <North> indeed

[04:57:56] <SpiritSong> so anyhoo
[04:58:02] <SpiritSong> what you thinking the experience means
[04:59:13] <Keith> i dont normally think into it to deeply.... it could be possibly something bad is gonna happen in family.....it could be another massive natural phenomenon.   i have never been able to tell
[04:59:51] <SpiritSong> but something happens after usually?
[05:00:01] <Keith> usually yeah.

[05:05:13] <SpiritSong> i ended up blocking out those
[05:05:55] <North> I think I know what it signifies, Keiffer    
[05:06:12] <Keith> same here........ the first time was with my cousin... I knew a week before he killed himself.  but i didn't know what it was about...just that something bad was going to happen.  broke down crying at work in front of my mom
[05:06:24] <Keith> speak freely North
[05:06:30] * SpiritSong hugs keith
[05:06:34] <North> apparently, it's going to be raining like hell tomorrow morning...just in time for my morning walk     :/

[05:06:38] <North> coincidence?
[05:06:41] <SpiritSong> <3
[05:06:41] <North> I THINK NOT
[05:06:42] <Keith> it's okay.
[05:06:56] *** Quits: Emanon (Nameless@sorcery-5nh10d.fios.verizon.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[05:06:59] <Keith> coincidence in what fact?
[05:07:14] <SpiritSong> its doffocultue when you forsee these things because you dont know what exactly and you feel helpless <3
[05:07:47] <Keith> yup...... I have vad it happens about 5 or 6 times.....last time was with my grandma after she wiped out
[05:09:03] <SpiritSong> do you feel specifics or just intense worry around that person
[05:09:07] <SpiritSong> when you know who it is i mean
[05:09:26] <Keith> it is just like an empty void inside of me......
[05:09:54] <Keith> the only way I knew it was going to happen to my grandma was because of the what happened..... I knew she had a week left.
[05:10:05] <Keith> i dont know who or how
[05:10:19] <SpiritSong> nods
[05:10:26] <SpiritSong> unsettling to say the kleast
[05:11:07] <Keith> perhaps it is connected to how i should have survived birth.
[05:11:16] <SpiritSong> i tend to know who...i knew my neighbour would die...went up to see her cause i dint want to not have seen her in months and then she die...i liked her...but i went up to her house and she had died that mroning
[05:11:18] <Keith> just dont know
[05:11:35] <SpiritSong> how you should ahve survived birth?
[05:11:37] <Keith> sorry to hear it SpiritSong
[05:12:10] <Keith> my mom and dad were both big drinkers, and pot heads.......along with acid and shrooms.
[05:12:37] <SpiritSong> ahhh, it affected your prenatal health?
[05:13:24] <Keith>   when my mother got pregnant with my older brother, she quit completely, and everything went fine... no smoking no drinking or anything.   afterwards she got pregnant and kept doing drugs and drinking, and miscarried.  well she got pregnant with me, and decided to keep drinking and doing drugs, and i managed to pull through
[05:13:37] <Keith> i could possible have FAS.
[05:13:42] <Keith> never looked into it
[05:14:18] <SpiritSong> could be the case, but you may be simply spiritually gifted ^_^
[05:14:58] <Keith> possibly...... ever since i was young i have believed in the supernatural
[05:15:10] <Keith> my mom said when i was about 2 i had a ghost for a friend
[05:15:20] <SpiritSong> you never lost your connection like a lot of people do when they reach adulthoos
[05:15:24] <Keith> then we moved out of that house cause it freaked out mom.
[05:15:27] <SpiritSong> oh wow 
[05:15:31] <SpiritSong> cool friend lol
[05:15:48] <Keith> yeah.... poor girl died of a bad flu or something
[05:16:03] <SpiritSong> aww
[05:16:09] <SpiritSong> was she very young?
[05:16:13] <Keith> and then i have seen spirits at other places, like my friends grandparents.
[05:16:24] <Keith> yeah.. if i remember correctly about 4-5
[05:17:29] <SpiritSong> id love to bring you to some ruins in ireland lol
[05:17:43] <SpiritSong> do you ever use spirit communication methods?
[05:17:52] <Keith> that would be so awesome..... I want to go to England as well for Stonehenge
[05:18:01] <Keith> no I dont.
[05:18:49] <Keith> i havea had only a couple exerpiences with spirits and chatting with them.
[05:19:27] <Iona> SpiritSong: spirit communication can take many forms...  what are you familiar with?
[05:19:27] <Keith> but it is more by coincidence.
[05:20:14] <SpiritSong> Iona, ive tried trance and pendulum boards and throwing shells
[05:20:22] <Iona> Ok
[05:20:26] <SpiritSong> :)
[05:20:43] * Iona thinks...
[05:22:06] <SpiritSong> keith, the one when you were a child the main one?
[05:22:26] <Keith> the girl in the trailer
[05:22:26] <SpiritSong> what about you iona? do you work in spirit communications?
[05:22:37] <SpiritSong> she lived in the trailer?
[05:22:45] <Keith> i dont recall it.  i have is what my other told i did
[05:22:56] <Keith> yes she did... she died in the bedroom i slept in
[05:24:16] <SpiritSong> its sad when kiddos die
[05:24:33] <Iona> SpiritSong: I don't know how to answer that question; I've had experiences that I still don't know how to dissect...
[05:25:30] <SpiritSong> i understand that iona..been there. it can be hard to wade through
[05:30:41] <North> farewell, friends

[06:07:13] <Pores> Hello
[06:07:22] <AntleredGirl> Hidee. 
[06:07:45] <Pores> I'm afraid of having bad mojo :(
[06:08:00] <AntleredGirl> Then...sage? 
[06:08:10] <Pores> I'd need to order it online
[06:08:18] <Pores> and do it on a Sunday, when parents are out
[06:08:26] <AntleredGirl> Ahhh, are we a closet pagan? 
[06:08:29] <Pores> then I need to find an excuse as to why it smells weird in the house
[06:08:34] <AntleredGirl> Okay, hold on.
[06:08:37] <Pores> I'm freelance spiritual
[06:08:43] <AntleredGirl> There are better choices than smelly sage.
[06:08:59] <Pores> but yeah parents are christian and think things are weird
[06:09:02] <SpiritSong> Pores there are other ways of clearing negative energy
[06:09:07] <SpiritSong> oh AntleredGirls got it
[06:09:09] <SpiritSong> :)
[06:09:15] <AntleredGirl> No, SpiritSong, please help.
[06:09:20] <Pores> Lol
[06:09:56] <Pores> I've tried being perceptive of the energy, trying to understand its nature and source, and clearing it that way
[06:10:08] <Pores> unfortunately, I lost the will to, because it's become too much at the time being
[06:10:41] <AntleredGirl> We use several ways to keep our house safe / protected / purified; hang iron by the door to keep out what you don't want; agates in the windows or in your doorway create a field of protection; purifying space with brooms. 
[06:10:50] <SpiritSong> hang on
[06:10:58] <Pores> Interesting
[06:12:29] <AntleredGirl> You can build a drawing / sculpture / whatever of any spirits you petition to help keep negative energy out and keep it up somewhere; salt around the perimeter of your room will do in a pinch, or salted water...
[06:12:54] <SpiritSong> you can use blessed water also
[06:13:02] <AntleredGirl> Draw protective symbols over your windows with your finger, imagine building it with your energy to create a field of protection.
[06:13:04] <Pores> Hmmm... how can you use salted/blessed water?
[06:13:05] <SpiritSong> spritze it around
[06:13:11] <SpiritSong> salted and blessed
[06:13:12] <Pores> oh I see
[06:13:19] <Pores> hmm
[06:13:34] <SpiritSong> just dont spray it on the wallpaper:P
[06:13:37] <AntleredGirl> Pores: Bless your water with a prayer, add salt to purify--bringing these two elements together is powerful. 
[06:13:45] <AntleredGirl> If I'm right, SpiritSong, hopefully.
[06:14:00] <Pores> Thanks for the techniques
[06:14:14] <SpiritSong> you can use bells too...the energy from the sound is pure and dispells negative energy
[06:14:20] <Pores> interesting
[06:14:22] <AntleredGirl> Beeeells! I forgot about bells!
[06:14:28] <SpiritSong> and right AntleredGirl
[06:14:28] <Pores> I have bells hanging out infront of my front doors
[06:14:39] <SpiritSong> you can leave it under the moonlight over the full moon perido also
[06:14:46] <SpiritSong> thats awesoome
[06:14:56] <Pores> I shouldn't ring them since it's nighttime, and neighbors live nearby
[06:15:14] <AntleredGirl> RIng them every time you pass them.
[06:15:19] <Pores> Hmmm
[06:15:21] <Pores> I might :3
[06:15:32] <AntleredGirl> You can also use Tibetan prayer flags.
[06:15:39] <AntleredGirl> They can be found at any World Market if you're in the US.
[06:15:45] <AntleredGirl> They purify the air with prayers.
[06:15:57] <SpiritSong> oh thats what those are for hehe
[06:16:00] <AntleredGirl> I used those for a while. 
[06:16:05] <SpiritSong> they sell them locally
[06:16:06] <Pores> If I stumble across them
[06:16:10] <SpiritSong> they are lovely arent they?
[06:16:13] <AntleredGirl> They are!
[06:17:26] <Pores> Thanks again for the ideas
[06:17:31] <AntleredGirl> Absolutely, Pores.
[06:17:46] <AntleredGirl> I empathize with you; my parents were fundy Christians.
[06:17:55] <Pores> yeah
[06:18:09] <SpiritSong> you can cleanse yourself too, with a salt water bath ^_^
[06:18:27] <Pores> ooo
[06:18:28] <SpiritSong> some people put in some dried sage too but i ddi that once years ago and it clogged.....
[06:18:30] <AntleredGirl> You can get really, really good at hiding your things, but look forward to the day when you're on your own, and hiding is no longer a problem. It will happen. 
[06:19:11] <Pores> Oh my gosh, I'd fill my room with all these things
[06:19:28] <AntleredGirl> I filled my house with ours! My roommate and I are both pagan. :D
[06:19:54] <AntleredGirl> (so is my mister) (and having a pagan loved one is super cool and awesome) 
[06:21:28] <AntleredGirl> (I say that because all my previous loved ones were Christian XD)
[06:21:33] <Pores> Amazing <3
[06:21:35] <Pores> ah I see
[06:21:56] <SpiritSong> that is pretty cool :)
[06:21:58] <Pores> I tried doing something. I hope it worked
[06:22:04] <AntleredGirl> Yeah? 
[06:22:34] <Pores> I moved my hands around and made little symbols
[06:23:22] <Pores> and crossed my hand through a line
[06:23:27] <AntleredGirl> Good! Excellent. Some people use wands, because they work for them, but Cunningham always says that your pointer finger is just as good, if not better. 
[06:23:41] <Pores> I was hoping I did something good
[06:23:59] <AntleredGirl> Put power behind that hope. OH! Also, something I did--
[06:24:06] <AntleredGirl> (that worked really well( 
[06:24:56] <AntleredGirl> THe next time you wander outside in the woods or wherever you decide to go, pick up rocks that feel like they're calm and quiet (like a rock from a still pond, for instance). Put them in a small bowl or cup and hide them somewhere in your domicile, where it won't be bothered.
[06:25:13] <AntleredGirl> The longer it sits, the more of that good energy will seep out from those rocks and fill your place with good juju.
[06:25:33] <Pores> Oh nice
[06:26:02] <AntleredGirl> I have a rock bowl, myself, filled with kentucky coal.
[06:26:23] <Pores> I got this weird feeling I should hold out my hands and imagine energy flowing forward through me, and did it.
[06:26:40] <AntleredGirl> Absolutely. Very good feeling to get.
[06:26:46] <Pores> Super awesome
[06:26:53] <AntleredGirl> The more visualization you can do, the better!
[06:27:13] <SpiritSong> go with your instincts totally
[06:27:14] <SpiritSong> :)
[06:27:41] <AntleredGirl> One of my favorite scientists says, we see with the eyes, but we see with the brain as well, and seeing with the brain is often called imagination.
[06:27:44] <AntleredGirl> See with the brain!
[06:27:52] <Pores> interesting

[06:48:38] <SpiritSong> still more to do or just finding it hard to unwind?

[08:35:09] <Keith> whats new pores?
[08:35:58] <Pores> I got banned from a chat I'm really involved in because of a moderator who wasn't aware of my intentions (other moderators started to learn where I was coming from and let me off the hook because it really wasn't causing any trouble; it just seemed to). I'm waiting to be unbanned

[08:36:38] <Keith> ohhhhh I see...... i have been banned before..... some people are just easily offended
[08:37:05] <Pores> Yeah, offended shouldn't be a warrant for being banned, unless it is putting someone in danger
[08:37:26] <Keith> or it is obscenely rude.
[08:37:42] <Pores> Sometimes obscenely rude is misunderstood
[08:37:49] <Pores> I personally believe all forms of actions should be preserved
[08:37:53] *** Quits: SnakeEyes (SnakeEyes@sorcery-qfqfct.phnx.qwest.net) (Quit: http://www.kiwiirc.com/ - A hand crafted IRC client)
[08:37:54] <Pores> It is better in the long-run
[08:38:09] <Keith> more poise could be used... no need to throw a shit factory at someone
[08:38:11] <Pores> Putting people in danger is a soft-cap for me
[08:38:27] <Keith> yes..... but rooms have rules though.
[08:38:43] <Keith> some bending of them is fine... but not breaking
[08:38:53] <Keith> and pending on how many times it is done
[08:39:06] <Pores> I think politeness and elegance is as important as rude and disruptiveness.
[08:39:14] <Pores> I personally think rules in chatrooms are silly
[08:39:41] <Keith> it is like being at someones house as a guest.... if you are being rude, they have the right to kick you out
[08:39:52] <SpiritSong> agreed keith
[08:40:17] <Pores> Yes, but if I were the owner, allowing people to be rude in my house would give more life to the party :P
[08:40:27] <Keith> now if you want to start your own room Pores... then feel free to have it rule free...... that is your option for YOUR room
[08:40:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That is simple Social Convention. You enter someone else's home, you have agreed to abide by the rules of their house.
[08:40:44] <Pores> I'm not saying a room should follow my rules if it doesn't have my rules
[08:40:48] <Keith> I would think you might finding it grinding after a while
[08:41:17] <Keith> especially if what is said is being directed at you
[08:41:29] <Pores> Let me put it this way. I think we freak out too much over eachother's and our own actions. We should let things slide more often, to better our quality of life
[08:41:31] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Abraxas define rules
[08:41:35] <Keith> I hope jenna rests well

[08:42:10] <SpiritSong> Abraxas explain rules
[08:42:13] <Abraxas> Posted by 02Hrafnbjorn on 0210/02/2015
[08:42:15] <Abraxas> (1) no nudity, pornography, vulgarity or sexually explicitness in chat or forums.(2) No illicit drug talk in chat or forums (illicit drugs are those that are illegal to make, sell, or use.)(3) no racism, derogatory, or hate speech in chat or forums.(4) harassing others and deliberately antagonizing, will not be tolerated. If this is happening to you, please talk to an op.(5) Treat others with respect.
[08:42:25] <Keith> Pores, that i agree with.  we should be able to voice our opinions without others over reacting....ask about it before losing your mind.  understand where the person is coming from
[08:42:40] <Pores> Yes yes yes yes yes
[08:42:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Right, explain, I forgot. Thak ye, lass.
[08:42:45] <SpiritSong> :)
[08:42:59] <Pores> You take away unnecessary bans and kicks that way
[08:43:25] <Pores> Some people think voicing your opinion is trying to start drama
[08:43:27] <Keith> but it in no way means you have to be rude.
[08:43:53] <Pores> Yeah. I don't like being rude to people who don't like being treated rudely
[08:44:19] * Keith hugs da SpiritSong
[08:44:25] <Pores> Voicing your opinion is how you start discussion almost all of the time, and some people kick for that...
[08:44:47] <Keith> it is also dependant upon how you state your opinion
[08:44:49] <SpiritSong> im all fro free speech but in the same breath if someone is overly rude and hostile to others, im going to ban

[08:45:32] <Pores> Yes, thanks
[08:45:38] <SpiritSong> mostly only if someone treats others like crap :)
[08:46:06] <Pores> I come from a divination chat, so basically everyone in there is psychic
[08:46:34] <Pores> If I state something that's happening in terms of energy, usually people pick up on it as well, or even agree
[08:47:02] <Escovan> I´ve had some IRC op-abuse experiences. But, there are far more chatrooms than abusing ops.
[08:47:03] <Pores> Sometimes if someone doesn't like that person, they can disagree, and they make the person look bad, because it's hard to prove psychic findings
[08:47:16] <Pores> It's true
[08:47:49] <Pores> Some people, I call chipmunks, like to complain to the OPs constantly, until that person gets banned
[08:47:56] <Pores> And often the person who gets banned doesn't get to defend themselves
[08:48:01] <Pores> Sometimes it's even a sudden ban without warning
[08:48:50] <Pores> I think it's rarely an actual viable reason in these cases
[08:48:53] <SpiritSong> ugh yeah ban without both sides isnt good
[08:48:56] <Pores> Just someone who doesn't like someone
[08:49:05] <Pores> no not at all
[08:50:52] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I can assure you that no one has ever been kicked or banned from here without cause, Pores.
[08:51:16] <Pores> Alright, cool
[08:51:25] <Pores> I'm just mostly recovering from unfair banning in another channel
[08:51:32] <SpiritSong> exactly ArchrWndrMcRbrt
[08:51:41] <Pores> It was pretty darn harsh in terms of emotional energy, and was uncalled for
[08:52:32] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Other here can bear witness; There used to be a chatter her I didn't see eye to eye with, I didn't kick him until afte the rules had been pointed out to him, and he was asked to adjust his behavior, and refused to saying he didn';t "hold truck with rules".
[08:53:30] <SpiritSong> yup
[08:53:32] <Pores> Hmmm, I see
[08:54:36] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I have no problem with differing opinions,m as long as it's done in a civil manner.
[08:54:41] * Keith plops into his beanbag chair
[08:56:19] <SpiritSong> we have no issuees undoing a ban if we see we were wrong either
[08:56:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> True statement.
[08:57:00] <Keith> yeah.... I like this room more now then back in the past.... some of the other visitors were a pain in the butt :)
[08:58:14] <SpiritSong> lol
[08:58:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, there is no quarantee that "pains in the butt" won't be coming in, from time to time.
[08:59:52] <SpiritSong> lol tue
[09:00:03] <Keith> yeah... but when they areconstant visitors... that is a different story
[09:00:34] <Pores> Ok cool

[09:57:43] <DPStrogen> I agree ^_^
[09:57:50] <Keith> how many are in your coven?
[09:58:27] <DPStrogen> Just 4 - It's a transfeminine-centric coven, so we don't get many people looking to join. We're small, but we try.
[09:58:47] <Keith> transfeminine??
[09:58:57] <Keith> that is a new term for me

[10:29:42] <DawnBat> is Keith santa clause?
[10:30:20] <Keith> definitely not
[10:30:41] <DawnBat> some day maybe
[10:31:06] <Keith> I would never accept that job willingly
[10:31:15] <DawnBat> for why
[10:31:45] <Keith> not my can of coke
[10:32:00] <Keith> though if you wish I can be more specific

[10:35:09] <Keith> I personally dont like gifts.
[10:35:43] <Keith> if you can consider a compliment from sone a gift, or the time you spend with friends a priceless gift.... well, I kinda pity them
[10:36:30] <DawnBat> if I remember right, Santa' a pagan concept anyways
[10:36:33] <Keith> hell 98% of the time i want to destroy the human race...

[10:41:41] <Keith> DPStrogen it happens :)
[10:42:28] <DawnBat> ugh
[10:42:32] <DawnBat> I'm lonely
[10:43:07] <Keith> it can suck being alone... i know that all to well.
[10:43:34] <Keith> but over the years..... things have happened... i got tired of hurting people... and found that being on my own isn't really that bad
[10:43:47] <DawnBat> I mean
[10:43:52] <DawnBat> I want to socialise
[10:43:58] <Keith> get out there then
[10:44:09] <DawnBat> there's no one awake xD
[10:44:20] <Keith> try shifting your sleeping pattern
[10:44:38] <Keith> do you live in a city or town?
[10:44:48] <Keith> do you play any TCG ??
[10:44:53] <DawnBat> city, but it's really not that big
[10:44:55] <DawnBat> and no not realy
[10:44:57] <DawnBat> only vg
[10:45:38] <Keith> why not, see what fb pages may be going on  in your city. find a group and try meeting new people
[10:45:55] <DawnBat> Eh
[10:45:59] <Keith> there might be a vg group you can join to talk about games
[10:46:11] <Keith> you'll never know who or what you might meet
[10:46:12] <DawnBat> I can socialise but i'm never awake during those hours
[10:46:24] <Keith> hence shift your sleeping pattern
[10:46:33] <DawnBat> how xD
[10:47:23] <Keith> force yourself to go to bed at certain times... even though it may suck.... force yourself to go to bed at a time....and dont get up unless you HAVE TO.  you would prolly get so bored you would pass out anyways
[10:47:33] <Keith> maybe try meditating
[10:48:17] <Keith> try settling your energy. don't let it over take you. soothe it and relax.  let it flow like water through your body
[10:49:04] <DawnBat> hmmm
[10:50:12] * DawnBat sniffles
[10:50:21] <Keith> you must learn to control yourself.  Believe in what you can do.  so many people have self doubt.
[10:50:25] * Keith hugs you softly
[10:50:50] <Keith> you must take charge of yourself...lead the way, your way. take control

[18:48:29] <Quad> society has built a institution of close minded individuals
[18:48:40] <Keith> it is opening up
[18:50:31] <Quad> ok, so check this
[18:51:35] <Quad> The instant life ceased the opposite scale pan fell with a suddenness that was astonishing – as if something had been suddenly lifted from the body. Immediately all the usual deductions were made for physical loss of weight, and it was discovered that there was still a full ounce of weight unaccounted for.  -Dr. Duncan MacDougall -
[18:52:18] <Keith> ok
[18:52:20] <Quad> now his theory has been disproven
[18:52:31] <Quad> why?
[18:53:05] <Keith> an ounce isn't that much... they probably put it towards something else
[18:54:09] <Quad> the idea was that the soul weighed 21grams
[18:54:21] <Keith> I dont see that myself
[18:54:28] <Keith> but it is possible
[18:55:05] <Quad> the reason it was discarded, was because the expeiriment wasn't reapeated
[18:55:52] <Keith> it could be equated to the body drying out a bit or anything... many many variables
[18:55:52] <Quad> also that they said he didn't have a proper control group
[18:56:15] <Quad> this was weight loss upon death
[18:56:38] <Quad> as in, he had dying patients on a scale
[18:56:54] <Keith> i would have to see how they were keeping track of the information and what not.
[18:56:55] <Quad> and measured upon the last breath
[18:57:14] <Keith> i have never heard of that before
[18:57:48] <Quad> it has been notoriously refuted many times
[18:58:19] <Quad> but no1 is willing to retry the expeiriment....for obvious reasons
[18:58:38] <Keith> yeah.. makes sense no one would want to die on a scale
[18:58:53] <Quad> hard to convince som1 to die for the sake of proving trhe soul
[18:59:34] <Keith> yup
[19:00:01] <Quad> well, to die on a scale for one, but also a control group needs to be established....which means he would of had to commit murder
[19:00:23] <Quad> i.e.:kill some1 healthy
[19:00:34] <Quad> control group
[19:01:00] <Quad> which is why it can't be proven
[19:01:19] <Keith> so there you go
[19:01:42] <Quad> unless, you can find the source of the soul in the body

[19:02:43] <AntleredGirl> Howdy there, Keith. 
[19:02:52] <Quad> well, i think it's energy
[19:03:19] <Quad> and how would we measure energy leaving the body
[19:03:50] <Keith> perhaps the soul is energy we can measure yet
[19:04:21] <Quad> if we can get a baseline
[19:04:22] <Keith> can't even
[19:04:42] <Quad> we might be able to pull it off
[19:05:32] <Quad> ok, if the soul exists it has to be in the body, correct?
[19:06:47] <Keith> it doesnt have to be.... but most likely is
[19:07:03] <Quad> ok, so then lets go with that
[19:07:29] <Quad> how many forms of energy does the body produce
[19:07:33] <Quad> ?
[19:08:01] <Quad> alot, right?
[19:08:07] <Keith> bio-electrical, thermal, kinetic, chemical.
[19:08:31] <Keith> that is just what i know of off the top of my head
[19:08:57] <Quad> how many of those actually control what the body does on a conscious level
[19:09:32] <Quad> see, how i would need to minor in neurology?
[19:09:49] <Keith> all of them have subconscious activities... but i guess we do control some thermal and kinetic
[19:10:13] <Quad> not what we control
[19:10:32] <Quad> what controls us at the conscious level
[19:10:45] <Keith> our brain
[19:11:16] <Quad> which is bio-electrical, correct?
[19:11:49] <Keith> yup
[19:11:50] <Quad> well, ignoring the chemical...just for a moment
[19:12:44] <Quad> so all of our activity starts as an electrical impulse, which starts where(specifically)?
[19:12:59] <Keith> the brain
[19:13:16] <Quad> not specific enough
[19:13:34] <Keith> as specific as I can get

[19:15:51] <Quad> hold on, i'm trying not to derail
[19:15:58] <Keith> ok
[19:16:46] <Quad> everything starts with an electrical impulse, correct?
[19:17:28] <Keith> yup
[19:18:21] <Quad> energy that can be measured
[19:18:26] <Keith> yup
[19:19:25] <Quad> what happens to that energy when the body dies?
[19:19:46] <Keith> it dissipates.
[19:19:59] <Keith> or becomes aidfferent form of energy
[19:20:04] <Quad> as in leaves the body?
[19:20:13] <Keith> i would think so yup
[19:20:21] <Keith> might linger for a bit
[19:20:24] <Quad> i present the soul
[19:20:38] <Keith> energy is leaving our bodies all the time
[19:21:19] <Quad> not in the same way
[19:22:03] <Keith> we dont know that yet.
[19:22:09] <Quad> electrical activity doesn't just disapear, it converts to kinetic
[19:22:11] <Keith> hence needing the studies
[19:22:34] <Quad> if the body dies, it's not being converted
[19:22:49] <Keith> it could be converted into thermal
[19:23:25] <Quad> that would mean an endothermic reaction, because the body loses heat
[19:23:40] <Quad> very quickly
[19:23:43] <Keith> still being converted
[19:24:14] <Keith> and as to how quickly depends on other variables....temperature, humidity, air speed
[19:24:22] <Quad> but if it's endothermic, then it's still within the body
[19:24:52] <Quad> which isn't true
[19:25:45] <Keith> it could still be an exothermic reaction.  just not on a large scale.  keep the body at temperature for a bit, then the electrical energy is lost and the thermal is moving on
[19:25:49] <Quad> what usually happens to things that undergo an endothermic reaction
[19:26:05] <Quad> ok
[19:26:16] <Keith> they cool down
[19:26:25] <Quad> and?
[19:26:28] <Keith> there are so many variables in this it aint funny
[19:26:41] <Quad> i know
[19:26:58] <Quad> i'm trying to over simplify
[19:27:18] <Quad> it's actually really hard
[19:27:32] <Keith> usually is
[19:27:47] <Keith> but i am done on this subject
[19:27:55] <Keith> science isn't one of my strong suits
[19:28:11] <Quad> simple explanation for complex ideas, very difficult
[19:28:21] <Quad> ok
[19:28:28] <Quad> so new topic?
[19:29:21] <Quad> i enjoyed this, it helps me
[19:29:26] <Keith> good to hear

[22:47:03] <Quad> oh analasis
[22:47:29] <DawnBat> I'm sick of living off of college food
[22:47:47] <Keith> try finding a job that pays under the table?
[22:47:51] <DawnBat> meh
[22:47:55] <DawnBat> I couldn't
[22:48:16] <Keith> why not?
[22:48:31] <DawnBat> the stress would kill me
[22:48:48] <Keith> maybe try getting ID then go to school?
[22:48:59] <Quad> chances of a bullet ricochet off a ballistic vest, fragmenting, and hitting the patient 3 different places in the head....with patient surviving
[22:49:04] <DawnBat> how would I pay for school
[22:49:09] <DawnBat> that'd stress me out as well anyways
[22:49:20] <Keith> get a scholarship
[22:49:34] <DawnBat> and then i'd be in debt after
[22:49:35] <Quad> or a grant
[22:49:43] <Quad> how?
[22:49:48] <Keith> yeah, grants work as well
[22:50:01] <Quad> scholarships are free to student
[22:50:02] <DawnBat> don't college programs ask you to pay them back after school
[22:50:08] <Quad> no
[22:50:11] <DawnBat> oh
[22:50:17] <DawnBat> oops
[22:50:21] <Quad> thats what we call a student loan
[22:50:23] <DawnBat> I am thinking of student loans
[22:50:37] <Quad> grants are free too
[22:51:10] <DawnBat> schooling or jobbing would hurt me
[22:51:29] <Quad> i've trying to get into the system for a while, i know the terms
[22:51:34] <Quad> how?
[22:51:45] <DawnBat> I don't do well with stress
[22:52:06] <Quad> well, now i need to stay unemployed
[22:52:19] <Quad> oh wait
[22:52:39] <Quad> how badly does the stress hurt you is it medical?
[22:53:14] <DawnBat> I have anxiety and or panic attack
[22:53:32] <Quad> medicated?
[22:53:44] <Keith> DawnBat if it is that bad, can't you get on disability or something
[22:53:49] <DawnBat> I am
[22:53:57] <DawnBat> It's not enough for foods
[22:54:03] <Quad> on disability or medicated?
[22:54:07] <DawnBat> I only get 30$a week for food
[22:54:17] <Quad> hmm
[22:54:21] <Iona> DawnBat: find a food bank?
[22:54:28] <Quad> you need  job
[22:54:31] <DawnBat> No ID
[22:54:34] <Iona> Or a soup kitchen?
[22:54:43] <Quad> get an id
[22:54:48] <DawnBat> Don't know if there's any around
[22:54:57] <Iona> Ask :)
[22:54:57] <Quad> you have ss card?
[22:55:00] <DawnBat> Quad: I can't , we have been trying but since my passport is expired
[22:55:31] <DawnBat> I really don't know how to adult, I was just thrown out there. It's pretty overwhelming sometimes
[22:55:36] <Quad> passport being your id, with it expired you have nothing
[22:55:55] <DawnBat> pretty much
[22:55:56] <Quad> birth certificate?
[22:56:02] <DawnBat> they won't accept that
[22:56:26] <Quad> what about student id
[22:56:36] <DawnBat> DOn't have one
[22:56:55] <Quad> can they get you one?

[22:57:43] <Iona> DawnBat: call up the Social Security Administration about replacing a lost social security card
[22:57:44] <Quad> close enough
[22:57:58] <DawnBat> Iona: I have one
[22:58:03] <Quad> he'd have to prove he is him
[22:58:21] <DawnBat> I have an SSI card and a birth certificate but they won't take either
[22:58:24] <Quad> and a birth certificate?
[22:58:27] <Iona> With proof of residence, the SS card, and your birth cert, you should be able to get ID
[22:58:41] <DawnBat> thy wouldn't accept them
[22:58:49] <Quad> they won't take it?
[22:58:55] <Quad> where are you?
[22:59:02] <DawnBat> Montana
[22:59:02] <Iona> Also, ask about subsiditys to help with the cost
[22:59:23] <Quad> and they won't take it, why?
[22:59:34] <DawnBat> they're weird
[22:59:43] <DawnBat> Apparently they don't believe I am a citiizen
[22:59:55] <Quad> are you?
[23:00:01] <Quad> just curious
[23:00:01] <DawnBat> I don't know
[23:00:02] <CorvusCorax> where I live you are actually obliged by law to have a valid ID - either in form of ID card or passport. you can choose which, but having neither is illegal

[23:00:12] <DawnBat> I think it's under my moms name
[23:00:15] <Quad> how do you not know?
[23:00:24] <DawnBat> Because
[23:00:28] <DawnBat> I wasn't told these things
[23:00:39] <Quad> where were you born?
[23:00:46] <DawnBat> After I got back from treatment and turned 18 I was thrown into the world
[23:00:48] <DawnBat> Alberta
[23:00:55] <DawnBat> But my mom obtained citizenship
[23:01:09] <Quad> did you?
[23:01:12] <Iona> Ahh...
[23:01:13] <Iona> Hmmm.
[23:01:17] <CorvusCorax> doesn't the US have this rule that anyone born on US soil is automatically a citizen?
[23:01:25] <CorvusCorax> or does that no longer exist?
[23:01:29] <Quad> doesn't apply
[23:01:33] <Iona> Alberta is Canada
[23:01:34] <DawnBat> I wasn't born on soil
[23:01:37] <CorvusCorax> ah ok
[23:01:45] <CorvusCorax> doesn't Canada have such a rule though?
[23:01:48] <Iona> *in
[23:02:03] <DawnBat> I'm just tired of this crap
[23:02:08] <Quad> yeah, but without a passport he can't go back
[23:02:18] <Iona> DawnBat: Billings MT?
[23:02:22] <DawnBat> Iona: yeah
[23:02:31] <Iona> Give me a moment
[23:02:31] <DawnBat> the thought of being deported is terryfying to me
[23:02:36] <Quad> without citizenship he is not us resident
[23:02:58] <DawnBat> Quad: I remmeber it being under my moms name
[23:03:08] <Quad> but not yours
[23:03:14] <DawnBat> ugh
[23:03:15] <DawnBat> Well
[23:03:24] <Quad> well, nothing
[23:03:28] <Quad> thats that
[23:03:30] <DawnBat> I don't know, being adult sucks real bad cause I i don't know anything.
[23:03:41] <Quad> i've been there
[23:03:52] <DawnBat> I'm already sick and tired of this crappy arse existence
[23:03:56] <Quad> but i recomend calling ins
[23:04:13] <Quad> explain your situation
[23:04:58] <DawnBat> being deported would probably be best, then I'd lose everything really
[23:05:10] <CorvusCorax> well Canada ... there's worse place to be deported to. I read this story about a teenager who's father came from Turkey and f***ed up the immigration papers for his son. Then he died. The boy had been in the US as long as he could remember, but he wasn't born there. They deported him to Turkey and he didn't even speak a word of Turkish
[23:05:21] <Iona> DawnBat: calling the Social Security Administration for proof that you are a beneficiary will help prevent deportation.
[23:05:37] <Quad> tell them you think you're a citizen, but you're having trouble proving it
[23:05:37] <DawnBat> yeah
[23:05:58] <DawnBat> It's fine right now I would assume. I've been an adult for nearly 3 years.
[23:06:03] <Iona> Also, I would call up the Canadian embassy or similar
[23:06:03] <Quad> with a ss card you can prove it to them
[23:06:09] <Iona> They may know what to do
[23:06:20] <Quad> they can get files, and an id
[23:06:34] <DawnBat> I've been in this apartment building for nearly 3 years and it's government owned
[23:06:42] <Quad> ins is actually good in this case
[23:07:01] <Iona> The embassy can provide info and connections to help you at least replace your passport
[23:07:29] <DawnBat> ye
[23:08:58] <Quad> i still recommend ins, with a social, you'll be fine
[23:09:16] <DawnBat> sorry I'm silent, trying to stay calm
[23:09:43] <Quad> after all, a social security card proves you're not an alien
[23:10:11] <Quad> and the embassy only deals with their citizens
[23:10:20] <DawnBat> ah
[23:10:46] <Quad> if you have an american ss card, you are not a citizen of canada
[23:11:00] <Quad> call ins
[23:11:11] <DawnBat> I was underage wgen I got the card though
[23:11:14] <Quad> see what they can do
[23:11:23] <Quad> doesn't matter
[23:11:28] <Quad> you have one
[23:11:57] <Quad> you my friend are 100% us citizen
[23:12:36] <Quad> which means, sence you immigrated here, ins has your files
[23:12:51] <Quad> since*
[23:13:03] <DawnBat> I don't know what INS stands for
[23:13:18] <Quad> immigration...blah, blah
[23:13:24] <DawnBat> ah
[23:13:58] <Quad> they are the ones who would deport you if you weren't a citizen
[23:14:22] <DawnBat> ah
[23:16:22] <Quad> but you have nothing to worry about because you have a united states social security card issued from a united states social security administration
[23:16:50] <DawnBat> yes
[23:17:06] <Quad> along with your birth certifiate, which by law makes that 2 forms of identification
[23:17:36] <DawnBat> the government sucs
[23:17:38] <Quad> and an expired passport, which would provide photo id
[23:17:42] <DawnBat> this whole existence sucks
[23:18:09] <Quad> they will help you
[23:18:52] <Quad> after all, they have been keeping an eye on you anyway
[23:19:17] <DawnBat> oh fun
[23:19:31] <Quad> it's their job
[23:19:56] <DawnBat> i feel invaded
[23:20:05] <Quad> yopu are an immigrant, and they are immigration
[23:20:15] <Quad> makes sense
[23:20:41] <DawnBat> I wanna go hibernate
[23:20:46] <Quad> are you a felon?
[23:20:54] <DawnBat> no
[23:20:59] <DawnBat> I'm just sick and tired of this
[23:21:06] <Quad> do you have anything to hide?
[23:21:24] <DawnBat> ugh
[23:21:48] <Quad> if you haven't done anything wrong, then you shouldn't be worried
[23:22:02] <DawnBat> not woried
[23:22:04] <DawnBat> just tired
[23:22:23] <Quad> doubt they care what clubs you like they
[23:22:56] <Quad> i typed they twice
[23:23:07] <Quad> relax
[23:23:39] <DawnBat> i'm only really freaking out caus i am always in the dark
[23:24:25] <Quad> thats why you ask ppl
[23:24:32] <Quad> then they answer
[23:24:38] <Quad> then you know
[23:25:27] <Quad> no1 really expects you to have it all figured out, they just act like it because they haven't had enough coffee yet

[23:28:01] <Quad> no

[23:29:04] <DawnBat> I'm neither :3

[23:30:03] <DawnBat> I'm dead :)
[23:30:07] <Quad> nice

[23:30:54] <Iona> Yep, there's exorcists here in town, easy to find.
[23:30:57] <DawnBat> or both Quad
[23:31:13] <Quad> ugh
[23:31:34] <Quad> exorcists require too much paperwork
[23:32:00] <Quad> i would have to prove you are a ghost first
[23:32:02] <DawnBat> think of it this way'
[23:32:07] <DawnBat> I would be good for science
[23:32:14] <Quad> otherwise they won't take the case
[23:32:34] <Quad> good for science?
[23:32:58] <Quad> proving that a force made up of energy is haunting a chatroom
[23:33:49] <DawnBat> no
[23:33:53] <Quad> who thinks that sounds hard?
[23:33:57] <DawnBat> just an undead entity in general
[23:34:13] <DawnBat> just had a thought
[23:34:18] <DawnBat> would a demon wear speedos?
[23:34:19] <Quad> ok, again, who thinks that sounds hard?
[23:34:56] <Quad> only if they really thought it really made their buisness look big
[23:35:17] <DawnBat> well
[23:35:24] <DawnBat> I think it'd depend on the type of demon
[23:36:06] <DawnBat> this character is a 7,500 year old Harvester Demon
[23:36:47] <Quad> harvester?
[23:36:56] <Quad> like the truck?

[23:39:02] <DawnBat> Quad: They're neither good nor evil as well
[23:39:05] <Quad> sounds like a contradiction
[23:39:20] <Quad> well, demons are a species
[23:39:24] <DawnBat> they're described as chaotic neutral. They do wahtever they want
[23:39:32] <Quad> not "evil" entities
[23:40:18] <DawnBat> the way I write it is demons aren't inherently evil. They're just aspects of Cosmic Duality, they represent chaos

[23:48:46] <DawnBat> purity maybe?
[23:49:31] <Iona> Because a roman contraceptive was frequently used, and they knew it was aborting the children. Oddly, its even a ♥ shaped seed.
[23:49:47] <DawnBat> oh fun
[23:50:04] <DawnBat> question
[23:50:10] <DawnBat> how about a Purity Demon?
[23:50:19] <Iona> Yep. Valentine's Day was a day of promiscuous behavior
[23:50:24] <Quad> not impossible
[23:50:34] <Iona> DawnBat: already exists.
[23:50:35] <Quad> i guess
[23:50:49] <DawnBat> Iona: Really?
[23:50:57] <Quad> shh
[23:51:06] <Quad> don't tell the christians
[23:51:15] <Iona> Yes DawnBat. St. Valentine.
[23:51:18] <DawnBat> oh
[23:51:34] <Quad> wait, what?
[23:51:53] <Quad> before or after he was stoned to death
[23:52:06] <Iona> He was part of the gnostic approach to Christianity.
[23:52:11] <Iona> Before.
[23:52:17] <Iona> Orgies and such
[23:52:23] <DawnBat> Harvester Demons would be different than others btw, they'd just forcefully take your soul instead of bargaining
[23:53:01] *** Iona is now known as Iona`brb
[23:53:28] <Quad> death doesn't bargain
[23:53:33] <Quad> wth?
[23:54:09] <DawnBat> Death isn't a demon
[23:54:21] <DawnBat> death is a Primordial being
[23:54:34] <Quad> assumedly
[23:54:53] <Quad> but why the bargaining, where do you get that?
[23:55:15] <DawnBat> a lot of writings show that demons make pacts, you lose they get your soul
[23:55:24] <DawnBat> Faustian Contracts ya know
[23:55:58] <Quad> yeah, but that only surfaced during the rise of roman catholacism
[23:56:01] <DawnBat> true
[23:56:18] <DawnBat> well for example demons in Mesopotamia aren'tvery clear on the good or evil thing if I remember right
[23:56:41] <Quad> the concept of demons predates the rise of christianity
[23:56:46] <DawnBat> Pazuzu isn't exactly considered evil I think
[23:57:18] <Quad> alot aren't
[23:57:35] <DawnBat> atually
[23:57:39] <Quad> according to revalations even god has demons
[23:57:56] <DawnBat> I wonder why non-human entities have indefinite lifespans
[23:58:16] <Quad> the phrasing was changed to say beasts later
[23:58:25] <Quad> they don't
[23:58:38] <DawnBat> really?
[23:58:45] <Quad> gods die
[23:59:05] <Quad> many cultures have writings on it
[23:59:22] <DawnBat> well depends on the folklore, for example in the Popol Vuh the bat god Camazotz decapitated a major god and used his head as a playing ball
[23:59:28] <Quad> for example baldur
[23:59:43] <DawnBat> sounds Scandinavian
[23:59:56] <Quad> or him, which i refuse to type
