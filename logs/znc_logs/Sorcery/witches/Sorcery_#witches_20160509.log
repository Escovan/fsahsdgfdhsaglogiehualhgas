[00:00:13] <Witchit> I sewed my grandma a bag and she got really excited
[00:00:18] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, yes. But, I think that's the biggest factor.
[00:00:53] <Witchit> I guess you're right...maybe there are elders out there who are still full of youth
[00:01:05] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And, o ne can be MY age, and still have a spark of Youth in their heart.
[00:01:51] <Witchit> Very true :) When I work at Atria (an elder home), I saw an elderly woman with a walker dancing to a piano
[00:01:56] <Witchit> *worked
[00:02:27] <Witchit> It was a great sight...I asked her if she likes dancing, and she said she's been doing it since she was 21
[00:02:42] <Witchit> Youth can be any age, really
[00:04:57] <SpiritSong> hehe thats lovely
[00:05:25] <Witchit> She always wears a ton of barettes in her hair and wears pink slippers :)

[00:05:46] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> You're right, Witchit. Rodin illustrated that in one of his sculpures, "She Who Used To Be The Beautiful Haulmiere"
[00:06:12] <Witchit> Interesting, I'll check that out :)
[00:06:43] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It may shock you. The beauty is not immediately evident.
[00:07:46] <Witchit> I always liked the beauty on the inside stuff...I hate it when people say "the outside is who you are and NOT the inside." I agree that the outside can work as a part of you, but the inside counts as well
[00:08:58] <Witchit> It's sad to say, but strangers judge other strangers on looks first, which some people take to their advantage
[00:09:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Of course. The soul I really Am inside this shell has only changed in the knoiwledge absorbed in this life. The shell is a bit more worn than when I first inhabited it upon it's arrival in this world.
[00:10:42] <Witchit> ArchrWndrMcRbrt: I feel like you're judging yourself on your age...I wish more people didn't do that and focus less on their age and more on continuing to learn
[00:10:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I sometimes wonder about the shell I used LAST time, or even the next, but those thoughts are fleeting, as only THIS time matters, for now.
[00:11:00] <Witchit> That's good :)
[00:11:05] <Witchit> Keep that mentality
[00:11:37] <Witchit> My mom once wanted to go through plastic surgery because she wanted to look young again because she's surrounded by younger people at work
[00:11:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Oh, I have no real concerns about my age. I'm glad to have reached it, and still be upright and bresthing and learning.
[00:12:02] <Witchit> That's good, because you keep referencing it and I got kind of worried :/
[00:12:30] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I will NEVER get plastic surgery, or dye my hair. I've earned what wrinkles I have, and every gray hair, as well.
[00:12:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I joke about my age all the time. Ask SpiritSong.
[00:12:55] <Witchit> I agree. I feel like society makes people more self-conscious about their looks
[00:13:16] <Witchit> Especially in magazines and the media
[00:13:24] <Witchit> *media in general
[00:13:43] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> You don't need to worry about me, Witchit. I am MY responsibility, not yours. :)
[00:13:55] <Witchit> I know, but you're still my friend :P
[00:14:00] <SpiritSong> yup he does :P
[00:14:05] <Witchit> (Hope that's not too creepy)
[00:14:09] <SpiritSong> archy is proud of his years :)
[00:14:19] <Witchit> That's great Archr ^ ^
[00:14:27] <Witchit> I wish my mom had the same mentality
[00:14:42] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I'm glad that some companies are using older models, not only 16 to 22 year olds. And, also using people who don't look like a stick with a face on it.
[00:15:23] <TheAllison> I picked up The Asatru Edda last night - any thoughts? anyone ever read it?
[00:15:23] <SpiritSong> lol truth
[00:15:23] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The so-called "plus" sized people.
[00:15:28] <Witchit> Well not exactly....I see a lot of fashion magazines who take their picture and photoshop it
[00:15:46] <Witchit> I've never read it TheAllison, sorry
[00:16:00] * SpiritSong wanders off
[00:16:13] <SpiritSong> got to finish sometimes
[00:16:16] <SpiritSong> something
[00:16:25] <Witchit> Okay! Have fun SpiritSong!
[00:16:48] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I never really watched "Will & Grace", just a few episodes here and there, but I thought that Megan Mulloly was a very sexy woman, for example. And she was a little on the "plus" side.
[00:16:59] <Witchit> That's great ArchrWndrMcRbrt :)
[00:17:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Have fun, lass.
[00:17:41] <North> greetings, good Gidget
[00:17:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> brb
[00:18:05] <Witchit> Hi North!
[00:18:18] <Witchit> We're talking about models in magazines :)
[00:18:30] <North> ooo la-la
[00:18:54] <Witchit> Heheheh, more like my problems with them, but let's go with that XD
[00:19:29] <Witchit> Archr told me about how he appreciates plus sized women just as much as skinnier women
[00:19:42] <Witchit> Not like annorexic skinny, but, you know what I mean
[00:19:50] * North nods
[00:20:00] <North> beauty in every form
[00:20:49] <Witchit> To me it's not right to be fat and UNHEALTHY. Not at all saying plus sized women shouldn't exist, but sometimes people don't care about their weight, arguing that 'well bold is beautiful.' I would argue 'yes, if you're healthy'
[00:21:43] <North> health is certainly an important aspect in the equation
[00:22:39] <SpiritSong> im pretty big, but i can out perform skinny people in the gym :P
[00:22:44] * SpiritSong flexes
[00:22:56] <Witchit> Hehehehe
[00:23:07] <Witchit> I think that's very cool that you do that :)
[00:23:08] * SpiritSong is defending her big butt
[00:23:14] <SpiritSong> all is beautiful to me
[00:23:24] <Witchit> It's great to see you working out
[00:23:33] <Witchit> And I agree, all is beautiful
[00:23:42] <SpiritSong> ^_^
[00:23:46] <SpiritSong> it really is
[00:23:49] <North> also, I don't find implants attractive
[00:23:51] <North> at all
[00:23:59] <Witchit> Yikes...
[00:24:04] <Witchit> I hate implants too
[00:24:10] <Witchit> Fake tans are awful too
[00:24:19] <North> what a world
[00:24:24] * North shakes his head
[00:24:26] <Witchit> Why do people want to look like Donald Trump?!
[00:24:34] <North> lol
[00:24:39] <Witchit> Why is Donald orange anyway?!
[00:24:48] <North> BETA CAROTENE
[00:24:48] <Witchit> Why does he have permanent duck lips?!
[00:24:49] <SpiritSong> they can look good if done right and really as long as they feel happy with how they are looking, its all good
[00:25:10] <North> Donald...Duck
[00:25:17] <North> it's all starting to make sense
[00:25:20] <Witchit> I disagree...fake tans cause cancer
[00:25:23] * North nods, stroking his beard
[00:25:26] <Witchit> Oh my god North
[00:25:32] <Witchit> The world has to know
[00:25:34] <SpiritSong> oh yeah well cancer is bad...
[00:25:39] <Witchit> TELL THE MASSES
[00:25:40] <North> they have the right
[00:25:52] <North> DONALD DUCK, DONALD DUCK
[00:25:59] <Witchit> DRUMF
[00:26:03] * North shouts from the rooftops to blinking pedestrians below
[00:26:15] <SpiritSong> and trumps looks have nothing to do with his personality really..if he was a nice dude a sincere kind smile would make him nice looking lol
[00:26:21] <SpiritSong> personality shines through
[00:26:29] <Witchit> Actually, one time Trump misspelled his name on his own site
[00:26:35] <Witchit> It said "Drumf"
[00:26:39] <Witchit> It was amazing
[00:26:41] <SpiritSong> i just contradicted myself a little....but ye know what i mean
[00:26:42] <North> haha
[00:26:49] <North> what an idiot
[00:26:59] <North> (Trump, not Birdy Lou)
[00:27:06] <SpiritSong> i know north
[00:27:12] <North> <3
[00:28:12] <SpiritSong> <3
[00:28:15] <North> <SpiritSong> personality shines through
[00:28:27] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Trump reminds me of a tall oompah-loompah, with that skin tone and false hair.
[00:28:30] <North> as does cirrhosis, which might explain that orangey yellow complexion
[00:28:59] <Witchit> I don't know, he reminds me of a wrinkly orange with a yellow caterpillar on top
[00:29:23] <Witchit> But yes, that too ArchrWndrMcRbrt XD
[00:29:59] <Witchit> Honestly, it's sad that he was actually nominated

[00:30:10] <Witchit> Hopefully Bernie can squeeze through
[00:31:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I still think it's funny that "Trump" is British slang for "fart". Rather appropriate, too, since a fart is bad smelling warm air expelled by an a**hole.
[00:31:11] <Witchit> Hahahaha XD
[00:31:20] <Witchit> I'd believe it
[00:31:46] <Witchit> I really like Bernie though....he has a good way of thinking, and is a lot more honest.
[00:32:17] <Witchit> I think it's great of him to try and lessen student debt and invest more in transportation to lower greenhouse gases
[00:32:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> At the least, less dishonest
[00:32:35] <Witchit> Yeah.

[00:35:47] <North> here's what tastes more like white cheddar than this white cheddar popcorn I'm currently sampling:
[00:35:49] <North> ANYTHING
[00:35:58] <North> tree bark, for random example
[00:36:01] <Witchit> XD
[00:36:21] <Witchit> Oh god, what does it taste like then?
[00:36:43] <North> cardboard, pressed sawdust, and salt
[00:37:04] <Witchit> oeingueueuieg
[00:37:12] <Witchit> That sounds awful DX
[00:37:25] <North> Life: one great big teaching machine
[00:37:51] <Witchit> Yaaay.
[00:38:07] <Witchit> The only popcorn I like are ones coated in caramel or chocolate
[00:38:13] <Witchit> mmmmm
[00:38:33] <North> top drawer snack food
[00:38:57] <Witchit> My favorite snack food is non-existant. Any favorite food is non-existant
[00:39:08] <Witchit> I eat because I am >:D
[00:39:09] <North> I hate when that happens
[00:39:21] <North> what was the favourite thing?
[00:39:36] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I prefer popcorn made in one of those machines with the spinning arm, like in theaters. And buttered.
[00:39:53] <Witchit> I have no favorite food, that was the point. RANDOM CONFUSION
[00:40:01] <North> ahh
[00:40:30] <Witchit> I hate theater food to be honest Archr....movie theaters scare me in general 0_o
[00:40:45] <Witchit> But I gotcha, for me it used to depend on the theater
[00:41:08] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> What was it John Madden once said? Oh, yeah, "Some people refer to their body as a temple, and they watch what they put into it.; Mine is a garage, and I put anything that tasyted good in there."
[00:41:11] <SpiritSong> mmmm chocolate popcorn
[00:41:15] <Witchit> I was an usher at one. Never again.
[00:41:42] <Witchit> Yeah SpiritSong, I love cracker jack stuff :D
[00:42:06] <Witchit> If that's even in Ireland :P
[00:42:09] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I was an assistant manager of a theater my last year of High School.
[00:42:33] <Witchit> How was it ArchrWndrMcRbrt?
[00:43:25] <North> I was a movie-goer, once
[00:43:30] * North shamelessly brags
[00:43:45] <Witchit> That's fine North, it's just not for me :P
[00:43:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It was ok. I paid for my own books, supplies, clothes, and even paid my folks 10 a week room and board. (I was 18 the last few months). I rarely ate there, except on weekends.
[00:43:56] <North> oh, I came to hate it
[00:44:28] <Witchit> That's great Archr :) Good on you for being responsible!
[00:44:42] <Witchit> It's something I could have never done :P
[00:44:45] <North> the people sitting behind me had an uncanny knack for not shutting the eff up
[00:44:58] <SpiritSong> college fees ahve risen by 1000 percent sadly
[00:45:06] <Witchit> North, the feels are real.
[00:45:27] <SpiritSong> wish i could afford to go back lol
[00:45:44] <Witchit> I once was taking tickets and notices a mom was trying to sneak her kid into an R rated movie
[00:45:46] <SpiritSong> ireland has free fees though, so its just accomadation
[00:45:56] <Witchit> *noticed
[00:46:17] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Sadly, colleges have become about education as secondary, supporting their athletes, especially football players, primarily, Big reason why tuitions and other fees have risen so much.
[00:46:19] <Witchit> I've seen a lot of stupid stuff from parents, kids, teens, EVERYONE
[00:46:38] <Witchit> Oh god ArchrWndrMcRbrt do you live in the US too?
[00:47:38] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yes, Witchit. Wiscons9in
[00:48:06] <Witchit> Yeah, I gotcha. They're cutting the budget in art classes, and it suuuuucks

[00:51:56] <North> maybe this is his calling

[01:53:03] <North> ...that, generally speaking, you just never know
[01:53:21] <North> is it some genetic thing?

[02:09:03] <Alyria> Speaking of crazy, and mother's day, today my mom said to me while we were chatting on the phone, "I should really be on 7 different kinds of meds but I'm not and I'm doing fine!"
[02:09:09] <Alyria> I just shook my head.
[02:09:37] <North> Mother knows best
[02:10:22] <North> phone conversations are generally awful
[02:10:43] <North> people cranking out words like a Play-Doh food factory
[02:10:56] <Alyria> I don't know, she and I talk all the time. Well, she mostly talks. 
[02:11:15] <North> what do you get out of it?
[02:11:20] <Alyria> I like to hear the inane gossip from home.
[02:11:25] <North> lol
[02:11:26] <Alyria> It's very folksy.
[02:11:33] <Alyria> Like Garrison Keillor.
[02:12:12] <North> well, as long as it's folksy
[02:13:11] <North> all too often, it's just people filling silence
[02:13:23] <North> the thing to be avoided at all cost
[02:13:25] <Alyria> She talks about people I don't know but probably would if I saw them - described like, "you know, her mother used to live in that big old blue house by Sharon's old house? Her oldest daughter's son married Tim's brother who had that little yellow house that burnt down?"
[02:13:30] <Alyria> Me: "Yup."

[02:51:40] * North reads into the terrible silence
[02:51:48] <North> well, here's what happened anyway
[02:52:04] <North> there was a small boy, perhaps 4 years old
[02:52:16] <North> not screamy or bratty in any way
[02:52:23] <North> just a nice little boy
[02:52:39] <MissSugar> ok
[02:52:40] <North> who approached his mother, toy in hand, asking if he could please have it
[02:53:15] <North> his mother, who didn't seem like a bad person at all, told him to return the toy
[02:53:27] <North> "If it's still there tomorrow, we'll buy it"
[02:53:54] <North> when they'd moved on to a different part of the store, I picked up the toy
[02:53:58] <North> 2 bucks
[02:54:15] <North> I wanted to give the money to the mother
[02:54:24] <North> but I didn't think she'd want that

[03:07:32] <oath> hmm
[03:08:24] <oath> mainstream normies/people would probably shun magik
[03:08:35] <oath> i think we've embraced something most people don't understand 
[03:08:55] <oath> seemingly in the usa most people seem to be christian and would consider me a devil worshipper

[03:11:20] <North> there ya go
[03:14:00] <oath> right
[03:14:14] <oath> anyways atm i'm looking into creating a golem of a sort
[03:14:46] <oath> i'm trying to figure out a circuitry of sorts
[03:15:04] <oath> a language to give commands
[03:15:16] <North> good to keep busy
[03:15:26] <oath> i was thinking hebrew but i know nothing about hebrew other than what i learned from the movie pi
[03:15:29] <oath> and the order
[03:17:19] <Raggiedmon> Creating a golem I have a question, if inteligent would you see as a tool or a child of yours?
[03:18:14] <North> or as a diversion to keep you from thinking about the shit you usually think about
[03:18:18] * North can't help but add
[03:19:01] <oath> it isn't intelligent
[03:19:13] <Raggiedmon> A question on that, are you certin your regular thinking is yours rather than something installed
[03:19:13] <oath> it is an enitity created for a purpose
[03:19:20] <oath> beyond that it knows nothing
[03:19:33] <Raggiedmon> And if does gain inteligent
[03:19:38] <oath> i kill it
[03:19:42] <Raggiedmon> who knows what other entitys would do
[03:19:44] <oath> pull the plug
[03:19:47] <Raggiedmon> Why?
[03:19:48] <North> too much has been deposited in our psyches without our permission
[03:19:49] <oath> i read some lore
[03:20:02] <oath> there was a story about a golem who got out of control and went on a killing spree
[03:20:52] <oath> which is the reason i'm looking for a language to program it
[03:21:17] <oath> it would be some intense energy work 
[03:21:41] <oath> complex construct 
[03:22:13] <Raggiedmon> Maybe the parent of that golem raised em wrong
[03:24:01] <oath> maybe it was designed with a sinister purpose and continued with its work
[03:24:57] <North> sorry to interrupt this serious discussion
[03:25:07] <North> but do ice cream cones ever go stale?
[03:25:15] <North> great things hang in the balance
[03:25:16] <MissSugar> yes
[03:25:20] * North notes
[03:25:29] <MissSugar> if they are in a place with a lot of moisture

[03:25:43] <MissSugar> well no even if they are not but it takes longer
[03:25:45] <North> you may have prevented an ice cream cone disaster
[03:25:55] <Raggiedmon> From what I rember from when I was young it may take a very very  long time
[03:25:55] <MissSugar> dude always use fresh cones

[05:05:08] <SpiritSong> nice!! omg im jelly
[05:05:26] <AntleredGirl> I'm SO excited.
[05:05:37] <AntleredGirl> Bringing cloak / hat / ceremonial mask for fire dancing / omg

[05:06:00] <AntleredGirl> I HOPE SO 
[05:06:06] <AntleredGirl> I have been packed for a week and a half!
[05:06:14] <AntleredGirl> And the ONLY thing on my mind has been CAMPCAMPCAMP
[05:06:35] <MissSugar> LOL
[05:07:33] <SpiritSong> when do you leave?
[05:07:37] <AntleredGirl> Seriously. TOnight I'm looking through what I have, what I can donate to the "free-cycle" table (old but safe occult books I don't need anymore) 
[05:07:51] <AntleredGirl> I leave Thursday morning and return either Sunday night or Monday.
[05:07:54] <MissSugar> oh man now i want to go
[05:07:58] <MissSugar> free occult books
[05:08:08] <MissSugar> i would bring some of mine to throw in there too
[05:08:52] <SpiritSong> me too
[05:09:08] <SpiritSong> we should have a swap party sometime lol
[05:09:14] <AntleredGirl> I wanted to make sure they were...you know...safe for others
[05:09:20] <SpiritSong> yeah i get you
[05:09:36] <AntleredGirl> So far I have "Pure Magic" by Judeka Illes and "Magic From Mexico" by some lady I can't see the author from here.
[05:10:07] <AntleredGirl> Wanting to bring a censer to burn incense but not sure...
[05:10:39] <MissSugar> Judika Illes!!!
[05:10:40] <AntleredGirl> Also actually I want to know: what would you do to purify or protect your campsite? 
[05:10:42] <MissSugar> i love her
[05:10:47] <MissSugar> i have several of her books
[05:10:47] <SpiritSong> ooh um
[05:10:48] <AntleredGirl> (she's so great!) 
[05:11:02] <SpiritSong> drumming cirrcle or bells?
[05:11:08] <AntleredGirl> I am already bringing a sage stick and salt.
[05:11:10] <MissSugar> if it were me i would get some egg shell powder
[05:11:16] <MissSugar> it would probably be the easiest
[05:11:17] <AntleredGirl> (totally bringing my ankle bells for dancing) 
[05:11:18] <SpiritSong> egg shell poweder is good too
[05:11:47] * AntleredGirl nods
[05:11:50] * AntleredGirl writes down
[05:11:54] <MissSugar> i actually want to make some chalk out of egg shell powder, so that i can draw protective symbols around the house
[05:12:05] <SpiritSong> i need a room cleansing method for here too, indoors, that isnt sage becuase its too humid here and the sage is always effen damp
[05:12:13] <AntleredGirl> I thought about bringing my besom but that is too precious to me to take camping. 
[05:12:29] <SpiritSong> im going to use bells prolly
[05:12:32] <MissSugar> there is a method involving crackers and a paper bag
[05:12:44] <SpiritSong> yeah might get damaged
[05:12:47] <SpiritSong> do tell MissSugar
[05:12:50] <MissSugar> where you take one cracker for each room and you rub the cracker gently in each corner
[05:13:02] <MissSugar> you put the cracker undamaged in the bag
[05:13:06] <MissSugar> and you do that for each room
[05:13:22] <MissSugar> then take it outside and crush the crackers in the bag and dump them 
[05:13:46] <SpiritSong> that sounds easy
[05:14:03] <SpiritSong> the floor corner?
[05:14:28] <SpiritSong> i i have little crevices in my room, id have to move the wardrobe to get at two corners...
[05:14:47] <MissSugar> the wall corner
[05:14:59] <SpiritSong> how does it work
[05:15:34] <MissSugar> you are pulling the negativity into the cracker and destroying it outside 
[05:15:52] <MissSugar> by pulling the crackers unharmed out of the house you are pulling the negativity you soaked up with it
[05:16:13] <MissSugar> the next method i know of is 4 white candles one black and a pile of salt
[05:16:34] <MissSugar> you place 4 white candles and in the center a pile of salt and a black candle in the middle of that
[05:16:45] <SpiritSong> hmmm crackers is nice and fast when im doing imprompto "please do it now" healings
[05:17:03] <MissSugar> the white candles draw in the negativity and the salt soaks it up as the black candle burns down, then you take the salt and dump that outside
[05:17:20] <SpiritSong> oooh i like that too
[05:19:32] <SpiritSong> ill use that one i think
[05:20:58] <MissSugar> the other one is the firey wall of protection 
[05:21:07] <MissSugar> but that is long and difficult
[05:21:30] <SpiritSong> do tell
[05:22:16] * North imagines the involvement of apple pie moonshine and a blowtorch
[05:22:36] <SpiritSong> lol
[05:22:43] <MissSugar> well first off these are the things you need
[05:22:45] <MissSugar> 7 Purple Offertory Candles 
[05:22:45] <MissSugar> 1 Black Offertory Candle 
[05:22:45] <MissSugar> 1 White Cross Candle 
[05:22:45] <MissSugar> 1 bottle Fiery Wall of Protection Dressing Oil 
[05:22:45] <MissSugar> 1 packet Fiery Wall of Protection Sachet Powders 
[05:22:46] <MissSugar> 1 packet Fiery Wall of Protection Incense Powders 
[05:22:48] <MissSugar> 1 packet Fiery Wall of Protection Mineral Crystals 
[05:22:50] <MissSugar> 1 Saint Michael Archangel Holy Card 
[05:22:52] <MissSugar> 1 packet Graveyard Dirt 
[05:22:54] <MissSugar> 1 Whole Angelica Root
[05:23:41] <MissSugar> i can post the actual spell 
[05:23:51] <MissSugar> but i might get kicked for flooding
[05:23:53] <MissSugar> its pretty long
[05:24:24] <North> O That Endor
[05:25:06] * SpiritSong notes
[05:26:13] <SpiritSong> try it if you want
[05:26:18] <SpiritSong> its not a ban
[05:27:15] <MissSugar> Preparation, In addition to the items here, you'll need a clean white handkerchief, a small square of tin foil, and a photo of the perpetrator; if no photo is available, write his or her full name 9 times on a small piece of clean paper; if his or her name is unknown to you, write "The Evil One" 9 times on the paper.
[05:27:42] <MissSugar> Now you are ready to begin. Make the Fiery Wall of Protection incense powders into cones on an incense burner. Place the Graveyard Dirt in a china-ware saucer.
[05:27:43] <MissSugar> Next, prepare the White Cross Candle for the Protectee. With a nail, carve the words " Saint Michael Archangel Protect Me [or the name of whomever you are working for]." Dress the Candle with Fiery Wall of Protection Dressing Oil. Dress the Angelica Root with the same Dressing Oil and place it at the base of the Candle.
[05:27:43] <MissSugar> Around the central Candle and Angelica Root, lay out a circle of Fiery Wall of Protection Sachet Powders.
[05:27:43] <MissSugar> Now prepare the 7 Purple Guardian Candles by carving upon them the names of 7 protectors. These may be 7 Saints, 7 people such as family members or co-workers, or 7 officials such as the Police, Fire Department, Child Protective Services, etc. -- or a combination of names from any of these three groups of entities. Dress the 7 Purple Guardian Candles with Fiery Wall of Protection Dressing Oil. Place them in a circle right on 
[05:27:49] <MissSugar> the circle of Sachet Powders that goes around the cross Candle. Sprinkle them with a little of the powders, too. Place the Saint Michael Archangel Holy Card among them.
[05:27:52] <MissSugar> Finally, prepare the Black Perpetrator's Candle. With a nail, carve his or her full name (or the "The Evil One") on it on one side and the words "Keep Away" or "Get Away" on the other side. Do not dress this Candle. Place it off to one side, outside the circle of Candles, on top of his photo or name-paper. Place the saucer of Graveyard Dirt next to his Candle.
[05:27:58] <MissSugar>  Fiery-Wall-of-Protection-Magic-Ritual-Hoodoo-Rootwork-Conjure-Bath-Crystals-at-Lucky-Mojo-Curio-Company
[05:28:00] <MissSugar>  
[05:28:02] <MissSugar> Light the Candles in this order: The Purple Guardians first, then the White Protectee within the circle, then the Black Perpetrator's Candle far outside the circle. Light the incense. While it burns, say out loud your prayer or wish for protection and call upon Heaven for aid. Ask for the intercession of Saint Michael Archangel, who guards Heaven with a sharp, cutting sword, and enjoin him to protect the one who needs 
[05:28:06] <MissSugar> protection with Seven Guardians, whether they be Guardian Angels or Human Guardians (including the Police, if you think this will be necessary).
[05:28:10] <MissSugar> Let the Candles and incense burn until the black Candle is half-burned. Then pick that Candle up and hold it in your hand. Take the perpetrator's photo or name-paper and lay it on the saucer of Graveyard Dirt . Set it on fire with the perpetrator's own black Candle and say, "Let your evil self be your own undoing!" When the paper has burned, turn the perpetrator's Candle upside down and extinguish it in the Graveyard Dirt 
[05:28:15] <MissSugar> and say, "Let your evil works be your ending!"
[05:28:18] <MissSugar> Allow the rest of the Candles to burn until they go out. Gather up the Angelica Root , some Sachet Powders, and the Saint Michael Archangel holy card and wrap them tightly in the tin foil, making a small packet. Tie the packet up in the white handkerchief with four knots. Dress it lightly with Fiery Wall of Protection Oil. To protect yourself, carry the packet on you; to protect your home, place it by your front door, to 
[05:28:23] <MissSugar> protect someone you love, give it to them to carry. Dress it occasionally with one or more conjure oils to keep it working for you.
[05:28:26] <MissSugar> Take the left-over materials (melted wax, nail, and so forth) and the saucer of Graveyard Dirt containing the perpetrator's ashes and his extinguished Candle and carry them to a graveyard and throw them against a grave stone, being sure to break the saucer as you throw this mess. Don't say a word; just turn and walk away home and don't look back.
[05:28:31] <MissSugar> When you get home and everything is all put away and cleaned up, dissolve the Fiery Wall of Protection Crystals in water as a floor wash and wash down your home, while you recite the 37th Psalm ("Fret Not Thyself With Evil-doers...") 37 times. You may also use them in your bath
[05:28:35] <MissSugar> and there it is
[05:29:14] * SpiritSong reads
[05:31:23] <SpiritSong> i like this one
[05:33:04] <SpiritSong> id use it if it wasnt for the wash down your home part...
[05:33:35] <SpiritSong> carpets...
[05:33:59] <SpiritSong> would squirting everywhere with a spray bottle do instead
[05:36:36] <MissSugar> a spray bottle would probably work just fine
[05:37:15] <SpiritSong> cool, mopping floors isnt possible in some rooms lol
[05:37:27] <SpiritSong> where to get the powerders
[05:37:28] <MissSugar> LOL this is true

[05:42:43] <MissSugar> i would like to do that on my house one day as well

[05:45:50] <MissSugar> what you do is you get the oil and the herbs mixed up and then you let that dry out, it might take a while.  then once that is dried up you grind it up and add talcum powder to i, you can also buy colored talcum to correspond with the working you are doing
[05:48:32] <SpiritSong> that sounds pretty easy
[05:48:55] <MissSugar> yup

[19:18:32] <AntleredGirl> The Beltane festival I'm going to later this week (OMGOMGOMG) is having an informal handfasting ceremony for recommitment before the community, before the maypole. 
[19:18:40] <AntleredGirl> So I spent last night knitting a handfasting cord.

[19:44:01] <AntleredGirl> I did Google witch runes to see if I had them though.
[19:44:25] <AntleredGirl> I don't, I has Norse. I haven't yet played with them, but I feel maybe I should bring them to the Beltane festival and learn a thing or two from someone more accomplished.

[19:47:05] <Witchit> Heheheh
[19:47:11] <Witchit> Yeah, I need a book for tarot
[19:47:20] <AntleredGirl> Memorization is key, but not the entire key for the lock. Only a part of it.
[19:47:39] <Witchit> But I can interpret well at least :)
[19:48:01] <AntleredGirl> That's the next part of the key.
[19:48:16] <Witchit> That's good, I'm doing something right XD
[19:48:20] <AntleredGirl> You are!
[19:48:29] <Witchit> Thanks :D
[19:48:39] <AntleredGirl> I feel that the most important part of interpreting when it comes to Tarot is learning what your elements are. 
[19:48:50] <AntleredGirl> (er, before this would be learning how your deck reads first, lol) 
[19:49:01] <Witchit> Heheh
[19:49:15] <Witchit> It's good to hear that from someone so experienced
[19:49:21] <AntleredGirl> When you know your elements, and what the deck's suits' elements are, you can interpret much more in depth. 
[19:49:50] <AntleredGirl> Say you get a reading with like...the Emperor, the Eight of Staves, and the Ten of Cups. 
[19:50:26] <AntleredGirl> The Emperor is the card of pater familias--he is the sacred masculine, a leader. He shows up with a Stave card (wind) and a Cup card (water) 
[19:50:53] <Witchit> Wow, I didn't know that 0_o I have a LOT to learn.
[19:51:02] <AntleredGirl> That means in his life of rule and dignity (assuming all these cards are right-side-up), he uses the intelligence of wind and the compassion of water.
[19:51:13] <AntleredGirl> He is balanced by those elements. 
[19:51:31] <Witchit> Gotcha :)
[19:51:36] <AntleredGirl> Then you look at the cards themselves--the Eight of Staves, in my deck, is a success card--success after long fight. 
[19:52:08] <AntleredGirl> Ten of Cups is the last of the cup cards and is therefore THE love card, the card that displays overflowing love. 
[19:52:24] <Witchit> Right....so it's not just the meanings, it's also the type of card
[19:52:26] <AntleredGirl> If he were framed by Swords, he would have used Fire. 
[19:52:36] <AntleredGirl> And if he were framed by Discs, he would have used Earth.
[19:52:49] <Witchit> Oh god, elements are going to be super confusing @_
[19:52:51] <Witchit> *@_@
[19:52:56] <AntleredGirl> Right! There are SO MANY levels of interpretation.
[19:53:05] <Witchit> Aaaagh
[19:53:11] <AntleredGirl> You just have to get used to your cards, and how they speak.
[19:53:22] <AntleredGirl> You don't have to know EVERY card; but it does help to know the Major Arcana. 
[19:54:11] <Witchit> That would be very useful :) I do have the signs in my book, but was too confused to understand
[19:54:14] <AntleredGirl> I'll tell you what helps me remember:
[19:54:16] <Witchit> I'll look back at that
[19:54:55] <AntleredGirl> I got the Renaissance Deck by Brian Williams, and each of the cards are very intricately and personally designed. Say you have, again, the Eight of Staves. The Staves suit is depicted by the story of the hero Herakles.
[19:55:31] <AntleredGirl> The Eight of Staves depicts Herakles winning the golden hind (fawn). It's a success card. If you were to flip it upside down, the success card becomes success delayed.

[19:56:24] <Witchit> I have these http://www.paulina.ws/tarot/
[19:56:30] <AntleredGirl> Oh I love that deck.
[19:56:33] <AntleredGirl> I have it, too!
[19:56:38] <Witchit> Sweet :D
[19:56:46] * AntleredGirl has like 30 decks
[19:56:50] <Witchit> It's my only one, but one that I take a lot of pride in
[19:56:58] * AntleredGirl nods

[19:57:17] <AntleredGirl> Get to know her, back to front. Read for yourself. Interpret in as many ways as you can with the help of a book.
[19:57:27] <AntleredGirl> (and I'll be honest, I bring my book with me every time I read) 
[19:57:40] <Witchit> Me too :)
[19:57:42] <AntleredGirl> (I always want to make sure to have a reference) 
[19:57:47] <Witchit> It's really helpful
[19:57:51] <AntleredGirl> There's no shame in it, even if you've read for a while. Right!
[19:58:19] <Witchit> Yeah, I really wish I had more decks but I'm just really connected to this one
[19:58:22] <AntleredGirl> try also, if you can find it, grabbing a Universal Rider-Waite.
[19:58:31] <AntleredGirl> Use that as a way to learn the basics. 
[19:59:15] <AntleredGirl> The only thing you must remember about a regular Rider-Waite, is that the Swords and Wands are swapped--in that deck, Swords are Air, and Wands are Fire 
[19:59:16] <Witchit> I know about that one, but never really had much interest in it as much...I also don't have enough money right now to get another one
[19:59:22] * AntleredGirl nodnods
[19:59:40] <Witchit> That would be cool to get another deck though :)
[19:59:53] <Witchit> So every deck is different?

[20:00:11] <AntleredGirl> Oh yes, every deck is personal. 
[20:00:33] <AntleredGirl> Waite didn't want all of the secrets of the Golden Dawn revealed, so he switched the elements in the suits of his deck. 
[20:00:58] <Witchit> Interesting :)
[20:01:02] <AntleredGirl> Crowley built a deck with wider cards and more esoteric and DEEPLY interpreted symbols. 
[20:01:24] <AntleredGirl> Williams built a deck that portrayed ancient legends.
[20:01:32] <AntleredGirl> And so on and so forth.
[20:02:05] <Witchit> So each card has different meanings in each deck?
[20:02:21] <Witchit> That sounds a lot like Oracle cards
[20:02:49] <AntleredGirl> In some cases yes, because many tarot decks today are based off of the Rider-Waite design (but with corrected suit elements, as in the case with my deck). But there are decks that are based off of other designs, like Crowley's Thoth deck.
[20:03:57] <Witchit> I didn't know that...how many decks do you have? :)
[20:04:08] <AntleredGirl> between 27 and 30
[20:04:10] <AntleredGirl> give or take
[20:04:17] <Witchit> Whoa 0_o That's so cool
[20:04:20] <AntleredGirl> We collect a LOT of decks; many of which are out of print.
[20:04:37] <Witchit> I have another question...can you interpret dreams?
[20:04:38] <AntleredGirl> My newest decks are the Robin Wood Tarot and the Wildwood Tarot.
[20:04:55] <Witchit> I kind of need advice on something
[20:05:24] <AntleredGirl> Anyone can interpret dreams as long as they know that dreams are a representation of our subconscious. In dreams, our subconscious sends us messages--it tells us what we fear, what we desire, what we're anxious about. 
[20:05:52] <Witchit> Oh! I think you've done this before to me...didn't you tell me to look at a pool in my mind?
[20:06:06] <AntleredGirl> I don't remember. :( 
[20:06:23] <Witchit> That's okay, I just found that pretty awesome
[20:06:38] <Witchit> And it was a very strange dream too
[20:06:46] <AntleredGirl> Just remember, you can interpret your dreams with nothing but a journal and an understanding of your own mind. 
[20:07:21] <Witchit> I've done it before, but sometimes don't even know myself :/
[20:08:38] <Witchit> I can interpret tarot, but not myself :P
[20:08:40] <AntleredGirl> remember what is on the door above the Oracle at Delphi? 
[20:09:13] <AntleredGirl> Know Thyself.
[20:09:18] <Witchit> I can't really remember, though I had an amazing greek mythology lesson
[20:09:21] <Witchit> Oh
[20:09:32] <AntleredGirl> It may take a long time to do so
[20:09:49] <AntleredGirl> but you will, one day, know yourself intimately as you know sight, smell, touch, sound.
[20:10:29] <Witchit> I can interpret prophetic dreams, tarot, spirit divination, but not myself. It's really, really ironic
[20:10:32] <AntleredGirl> I have to run now, gotta go to work. 
[20:10:38] <AntleredGirl> Oh, practice makes perfect!
[20:10:41] <Witchit> Okay, gotcha :)
[20:10:41] <AntleredGirl> Start with a dream journal
[20:10:52] <Witchit> Sure, I may do that ^ ^
[20:10:53] <AntleredGirl> and remember that your dreams are your subconscious just trying to say hi.
[20:11:02] <Witchit> Thanks :)
