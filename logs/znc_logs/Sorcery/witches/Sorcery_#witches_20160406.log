[00:45:45] <Chiaro> I'm wondering about the Goddess.  Do we think that she is a consciousness which has the semblance of individuality, like someone you might say a prayer to, or is she more like an echo chamber of collective creature vibrations that all merge into a kind of oceanic overtone, but one that is not, really, personal in nature?
[00:50:14] <Pores> I'm not a follower of any religion, but imagine someone who has ascended to the point in which they can almost unify with that echo chamber of collective creature vibrations that all merge into a kind of oceanic overtone
[00:53:18] <Chiaro> so, who's the "someone".... us, or the rare adept, or the Goddess herself?
[00:53:56] <Pores> I'm not sure what the someone means
[00:54:51] <Pores> Oh, I see

[00:58:32] <raevynskyyemt> Hi everyone 
[00:58:33] <Chiaro> So, you are saying, I think, that the Goddess herself, is also ascending and unifying herself with the oversoul, rather than embodying the superconsciousness a priori
[00:59:47] <Widdershins> pretty much- i dont see her/it as an entity that makes decisions per se... more fluid
[01:01:22] <Widdershins> a seperate decision making entity, not  to me
[01:03:01] <Chiaro> Does she have an agenda... does she WANT us to go right or left (as the case may be)?
[01:03:12] <Widdershins> the All is, to me, the masculine, feminine, animal, plant, and all other energies combined
[01:03:23] <Widdershins> i dont ascribe an adgenda to it
[01:03:32] <Widdershins> neutral and fluid
[01:04:25] <Widdershins> to me she/ it is like water
[01:04:55] <Widdershins> if i need a drink- i will dip my hands in - or divert to create a pond or pool

[01:10:54] <Widdershins> lol i hear that
[01:12:40] <Chiaro> Well, I like your image of the water, but water, while being flowing through matter, is fundamentally without consciousness, which means that forces are interplaying endlessly, but not having any particular intent, for example, for union or dissolution
[01:13:57] <Widdershins> i dont see the goddess ( for me the sacred feminine ) as having intent as i would understand it
[01:14:15] <Widdershins> i dont worship a goddess in that way
[01:14:55] <Widdershins> i simply see it as energies

[01:16:19] <Chiaro> not "good" or "bad", then
[01:16:26] <Widdershins> right
[01:17:55] <Widdershins> i seethe masculine the same way, as i also see animal energies and plant ect
[01:20:32] <Chiaro> so there's not so much a "duty" associated or a particular purpose assigned in our personal or our human blueprint
[01:21:24] <Widdershins> duty for me is something i feel as a person. But its repective to each individule
[01:21:28] <Widdershins> imo
[01:22:58] <Widdershins> a duty to help others, or a duty to defend the homeland..each duty is part of society, upbringing, nature and nurture ect 
[01:23:27] <Widdershins> each as unique in how it formed as the person
[01:23:50] <Chiaro> But, if you should feel a duty, who could be delegating it, or is it just one's fertile imagination at play?
[01:23:52] <Widdershins> but not ascribed to the "god or goddess' per se
[01:24:30] <Pores> Duties change as you ascend
[01:24:46] <Widdershins> yes
[01:24:56] <Pores> They become more and more intricate, and less deep :P
[01:25:12] <Pores> But higher vibrations
[01:25:54] <Pores> Oh, and an ascension level can see the level below it very well
[01:26:02] <Widdershins> we change, things important to us change too. I felt a duty for one thing...but passions now have me feeling a duty twards another- and each phase teaches
[01:26:05] <hihospaghettio> talkin bout them *starts dancing* good vibrations!
[01:26:07] <hihospaghettio> sorry
[01:26:18] <Widdershins> lol!!
[01:26:32] <Widdershins> now thats stuck in my head
[01:26:37] <Chiaro> Now... that's a vastly different picture if you are suggesting a hierarchy of ascending realizations, culminating, as one would expect, in some higher awareness of truth
[01:26:40] <hihospaghettio> *bows* you are welcome
[01:26:51] <hihospaghettio> I have to wait until the cats finish eating to lift my weights :(
[01:26:56] <hihospaghettio> They have taken my space
[01:27:00] <Pores> All perceptions are true. We just have to find out how they're true
[01:27:11] <Widdershins> i like that
[01:27:31] <Widdershins> to me 'ascention' isnt the exact word
[01:27:36] <hihospaghettio> mmmm, all perceptions are true to the perceptor, but maybe not to the percieved
[01:28:03] <Pores> Eh, I think perception in general is made a mockery of in contemporary society
[01:28:20] <Pores> We're more likely to believe everyone is blind than that they know some sort of innate truth
[01:28:30] <Pores> Despite us being so perceptive and intuitive
[01:28:36] <hihospaghettio> I think there are two truths, the percieved and the actual, because it's near impossible, if not impossible, to seperate a person from their perceptions
[01:28:50] * Widdershins grabs a bite to eat
[01:29:03] <Pores> I think it's more simple than that. There's two perceptions that may contradict somehow. This contradictory is illusory imo
[01:29:29] <Pores> They're both viable and true
[01:29:29] <hihospaghettio> how is the contradiction illusionary?
[01:29:42] <Pores> Because one thinks the other may be wrong, which is incorrect
[01:33:43] <hihospaghettio> if it is a reality, and by that I mean what happens outside perceived reality, how can it be incorrect?
[01:34:08] <Pores> Exactly
[01:34:32] <Pores> I think whether a perception is illusory or not is irrelevant to reality in general
[01:34:41] <hihospaghettio> but percieved reality can be incorrect
[01:34:54] <Pores> Or can it?
[01:35:05] <hihospaghettio> yup
[01:35:14] <Pores> We tend to think we're incorrect, which could just be the result of not percieving
[01:35:18] <hihospaghettio> it may be reality and correct to the individual, but it is not a universal truth
[01:35:30] <Pores> It may infact be a universal truth
[01:35:39] <Pores> How can we tell?
[01:35:51] <hihospaghettio> we can't, thats why we have to accept a truth outside of our reality
[01:36:03] <Pores> Or empower ourselves a little :P
[01:36:27] <Pores> The more we exist, the more we perceive. The more energy we have in many shades, the better our perception
[01:36:38] <Pores> I don't think there is a thing as a wrong perception
[01:36:56] <hihospaghettio> i disagree, but that is me

[01:37:02] <Abraxas> Welcome, cyan. We do not need to go out and find love; rather, we need to be still and let love discover us.
[01:37:03] <Pores> It doesn't have to be
[01:37:33] <Pores> Also, from my experience ascension is a hierarchy, but not one that implies inherent worth, or what is better
[01:37:48] <Pores> Infact, the lesser ascension parts are equally important as the higher ones
[01:38:00] <hihospaghettio> for example, a racist, a person who perceives others, spiritually and mentally/physically, as superior or inferior based on the color of their skin or their origins
[01:38:11] <hihospaghettio> I would call that a false perception
[01:38:18] <Pores> But what the higher ascension levels do it challenge an illusion of a lower level. As you get higher, your energy becomes more defying
[01:38:23] <Pores> And therefor more impervious
[01:38:40] <Pores> I think ascension is about becoming more invulnerable than powerful
[01:39:03] <Pores> Who says that is actually their perception?
[01:39:24] <Pores> We can see that this person says they believe that, but our perception doens't go that far. That doesn't mean our perception is wrong. Just not far enough
[01:40:25] <Pores> is challenge*
[01:40:38] <hihospaghettio> I think actions demonstrate beliefs and attitudes
[01:40:49] <Pores> I think beliefs and attitudes are the same as actions :P
[01:41:01] <hihospaghettio> a singular one maybe not, maybe it's a fluke, but repeated actions? that's science
[01:41:47] <Pores> Someone can be very repetitious with their actions, as to mimic a belief, but we cannot tell their belief unless we look at their belief
[01:41:56] <hihospaghettio> so we trust their actions
[01:42:04] <hihospaghettio> nothing wrong with assumptions based on fact, I think
[01:42:08] <Pores> Actions to hide other actions
[01:42:18] <Pores> It's hard to tell what is fact, if you're not looking at it
[01:42:34] <hihospaghettio> doesn't matter. fact is everyone has their own truths of the world built off their perceptions, but I don't believe what happens outside our perceptions is false
[01:43:16] <Pores> It's tricky because people make assumptions about what lies outside of perception using a perception that isn't able to see beyond
[01:43:25] <hihospaghettio> s'why it's always tricky
[01:44:19] <Pores> Assumptions are using a different perception within another perception
[01:44:31] <Pores> Otherwise there would be no inspiration of the assumption
[01:44:43] <Pores> I think if we just used the perception we're using to assume, things would be easier to discern :P
[01:45:46] <hihospaghettio> this is an old philosophical arguement though, and one that doesn't really have an answer, just that everyone is, to quote one of the philosophers I forgot, "everyone is an island unto their own"
[01:46:09] <Pores> Things are bit more unified than that
[01:46:27] <hihospaghettio> when speaking of perception I would disagree
[01:48:14] <Pores> I think it's simple when you understand its complexity. Perception is truth, imo
[01:48:46] <Pores> And truth all hinges off of one point
[01:48:50] <hihospaghettio> but it's only a person's truth, not a singular truth, that is what complicates it, imho
[01:49:32] <Pores> I think what complicates it is combining incompatible perceptions
[01:50:09] <Pores> You can have a perception that sees something in a certain light, and then another that cannot see it at all. If you apply that certain light to a non-perception, you get an illusion
[01:50:30] <hihospaghettio> they are perceptions, how can you really perceive if they are incompatible?
[01:50:31] <Pores> Something that may or may not be true. We cannot tell yet
[01:50:44] <Pores> If one exists and one doesn't
[01:50:56] <hihospaghettio> but how do you know if it really exists or not?
[01:51:09] <Pores> If it perceives something or not
[01:51:24] <hihospaghettio> how do we know it perceives?
[01:51:37] <hihospaghettio> the point is we really don't know anything besides what we perceive
[01:51:40] <Pores> If it's based on truth
[01:51:46] <hihospaghettio> what is truth?
[01:51:53] <Pores> I think you could if you were empowered
[01:52:04] <hihospaghettio> it's like trying to describe the color green to a blind person, it's rather impossible
[01:52:21] <Pores> They do not have a perception of the color green
[01:52:35] <Pores> It's an illusion to the blind person, and therefor not an applicable truth
[01:52:49] <hihospaghettio> that's just what we perceive, maybe they know it but don't know the name
[01:53:07] <Pores> We'd have to borrow their shade of perception
[01:53:10] <hihospaghettio> *shrugs* we could talk like this in circles all night, I don't think there is really an answer
[01:54:41] <Pores> Well, there's one way to prove my point of view :P
[01:54:50] <Pores> And it's seeing if your natural perception is correct
[01:54:53] <Pores> Test your intuition
[01:56:40] <hihospaghettio> but you don't know if your natural perception is correct because you will always influence the results with your perception

[03:39:58] <Chiaro> 18:14:15
[03:39:58] <Chiaro> i dont worship a goddess in that way 
[03:39:58] <Chiaro> 18:14:55

[03:41:01] <Chiaro> ooh... that's a problem scrolling when you copy a post

[03:43:34] <North> memo to self: suggest name later to baby-carrying Alyria
[03:43:59] <Chiaro> So, my question now is, is there such a thing as moral rectitude -- justice, for example, which would support a view of the divine as having a certain moral position to encourage, no?
[03:45:17] <Hrafnbjorn> not that I am aware of
[03:45:58] <Chiaro> No such thing as justice in the divine lexicon?
[03:47:17] <Hrafnbjorn> sure there is, however "Þat kann ek it fjórða
[03:47:17] <Hrafnbjorn> ef mér fyrðar bera

[03:48:17] <Hrafnbjorn> sure there is, however rectitude implies that there is rightiousness as a consequence.  All of the religious lore I am familiar with does not view rightiousness as a thing, all are flawed

[03:50:40] <North> haha
[03:50:55] <North> always good to have something to look forward to
[03:52:17] <Keith> yay bernie sanders
[03:53:01] <Chiaro> Widds is saying that the "sacred feminine" is just energies, not "good" energies and 'bad" energies, so that's where the question of there being any kind of moral foundation that is "in tune" with the sacred comes in... is the sacred feminine essentially neutral, or does it have a direction that is "good" versus "bad"?
[03:53:45] <Keith> energy in itself is neither good or bad..... it is the intent of the people using it, that determine whether it is good or bad, by effect
[03:54:34] <Hrafnbjorn> I *think* she was sayng that her view is that it is energy, and energy is neutral.  Morality, like all aspects of ethics, is subjective, and deities do promote certain moral ideals, however thats not the type of deity she refered to I think
[03:54:35] <Chiaro> But if there is no absolute standard for evaluating intent, then it is meaningless, no?
[03:54:49] <Keith> and good and bad is merely a person personal perspective on things... i might consider something good, while another thinks it is bad
[03:55:18] <Keith> to me for good and bad energies that would be correct.  they shouldn't be labelled as such
[03:56:11] <Chiaro> Simple question... is "justice" a divine cause?
[03:56:16] <Hrafnbjorn> I would not say it is meaningless.  Too many folk think that if our actions dont have profoundly huge impact they are meaningless, or such... I dont find that to be true, as it completely ignores many things like loyalty... there does not have to be objective things written in stone for things to be valuable
[03:56:32] <Keith> justice is like good and evil... it is all depenadant on a persons outlook
[03:57:12] <Chiaro> Nonsense... there are always interpretations of the facts, but justice is pretty obvious
[03:57:35] <Hrafnbjorn> how is it obvious?
[03:57:50] <Keith> Chiaro for justice... do you go by the laws written on paper.  or do you go by what is in your heart?? which of those is true justice?
[03:57:53] <Hrafnbjorn> Heathen justice would be unjust in our modern paradigm... just to gove example
[03:58:15] <Hrafnbjorn> *give
[03:58:46] <Chiaro> If I hurt someone, it is justified that I be exposed on some level for doing that
[03:59:01] <Keith> that has nothing to do with justice.
[03:59:12] <Keith> justice is the penalty brought about to you.
[03:59:58] <Keith> say I kungfu some drunk guy at a bar.  do I simply get charged with assault as per the written law? or do I get beat up by his friends because they feel that is more justified?
[04:00:23] <Hrafnbjorn> your ideal of justice seems straight foreward to you, mine to me, his to him... that doesnt make them obvious.  Sure there may be things we can pick out that are almost 100%, however those are just small aspects of the bog picture

[04:02:08] <Chiaro> Well, not to get interminably lost in semantics, the word "justice" has meaning to most or all people.  My question is, is the principle of justice divinely inspired?

[04:07:27] <Daniel--> i play uo but i cant really feal good enough to play till after it gets dark
[04:07:43] <Daniel--> once thesun sets i come alive
[04:07:50] <Daniel--> i am ready a night person
[04:07:52] <DawnBatApathetic> Ultima Online orrr?
[04:08:02] <Daniel--> yup ultima online
[04:08:06] <DawnBatApathetic> oolddddd
[04:08:36] <Daniel--> they still made another update to it recently
[04:08:53] <Hrafnbjorn> DawnBatApathetic, do you think you may have allowed yourself to become addicted to feeling this way?  It seems like your common emotional state, and we have to be careful with emotion because they are addicting, and will prevent the full spectrum
[04:08:54] <Daniel--> lots of people still play uo cuz it is a great game
[04:09:10] <DawnBatApathetic> it's still the oldest mmo alive though?
[04:09:18] <Daniel--> i think so
[04:09:25] <Daniel--> it was the first and the best
[04:09:35] <DawnBatApathetic> Hrafnbjorn: It's mostly I don't take my meds as often as I should, I am switching over to monthly injections
[04:09:49] <Hrafnbjorn> ah, ok
[04:10:00] <Daniel--> i get monthy inections of prolixen
[04:10:10] <Daniel--> and i take closipine every night
[04:10:23] <DawnBatApathetic> I am being put on InVega for a few weeks before the shots
[04:12:04] <Hrafnbjorn> In appologize if I seem a bit short... I worked today, and that always makes me a little.... short.  I can never tell after work if I am being an ass or not, so I wanted to appologize in case I am coming across that way
[04:12:20] <DawnBatApathetic> It's hard to offend me really.
[04:12:25] <Daniel--> what do you do as work ?
[04:12:38] <Hrafnbjorn> retail investigation
[04:12:47] <Daniel--> oh ok
[04:12:47] <DawnBatApathetic> The most aggravatin thing for me is people suggesting I meet someone new for a relationship
[04:13:00] <Hrafnbjorn> the investigation side doesnt bother me, the arresting side does though
[04:13:11] <DawnBatApathetic> That's also another reason for my apathy
[04:13:54] <DawnBatApathetic> question, what colour would a Succubus wear?

[04:22:09] <DawnBatApathetic> Makes sense
[04:22:33] <Hrafnbjorn> after that would be landvaettr... deity is towards end of the list

[04:25:55] <DawnBatApathetic> odd question, what was the Scandinavian Winter Festival/Holiday (if any)

[04:26:40] <DawnBatApathetic> So that's where it came frromm too
[04:27:00] <Hrafnbjorn> Yule comes directly from Heathenism, other pagan religions had festivals during the same general period, but they werent Yule technicaly

[04:51:38] <Keith> i had it.... it was a mini game in the game

[04:52:24] <MissSugar> i will help you
[04:52:32] <MissSugar> i am quite good at love spells
[04:52:36] <analagom> oh :)
[04:52:50] <analagom> i had this idea
[04:52:55] <MissSugar> ok
[04:53:06] <analagom> so like maybe everyday, i dedicate some time to performing a ritual
[04:53:10] <DawnBatApathetic> Booty Poppin Keith
[04:53:16] <analagom> putting together elements that remind me of that girl
[04:53:17] <Keith> I dont dance
[04:53:19] <MissSugar> 7 days
[04:53:25] <MissSugar> is a good number
[04:53:38] <analagom> and asking the universe to listen to my prayer,
[04:53:38] <Hrafnbjorn> is 7 sacred to you MissSugar?
[04:53:49] <analagom> but i don't know, is prayer too passive
[04:53:52] <DawnBatApathetic> I think I am gonna watch Star wars dancing all night
[04:53:57] <XCuteWitchX> Keith, You want to know how to get someone to dance? start shooting at their feet lol.
[04:54:07] <MissSugar> 7 is a sacred number, so is 3, 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 25
[04:54:11] <Keith> lol@ XCuteWitchX
[04:54:20] <DawnBatApathetic> XCuteWitchX: But how does one make them twerk
[04:54:31] <analagom> maybe to some love god or osmething
[04:54:33] <XCuteWitchX> Start shooting at their torso lol
[04:54:37] <Hrafnbjorn> 7 and 9 are the traditional European elemental #'s
[04:54:49] <analagom> or maybe i should make a god using something that represents love to me, and make that an idol on the altar
[04:55:01] <MissSugar> what i would also do analagom is get a pink or red taper candle and carver her name on to it then dress it with some rose water and light it while you work
[04:55:05] <DawnBatApathetic> there's love deities
[04:55:12] <analagom> interesting
[04:55:17] <analagom> i shall try that
[04:55:22] <analagom> but
[04:55:26] <analagom> what if you don't know her name
[04:55:50] <MissSugar> then i would put a piece of paper under your candle that describes her as specifically as you can
[04:55:55] <analagom> ah ok
[04:56:18] <MissSugar> i would also use a white candle with your name on it so that you are illuminated
[04:56:23] <analagom> thanks miss sugar. what about the formation of my prayer or spell casting words
[04:56:26] <MissSugar> so that you are noticed
[04:56:30] <analagom> oh ok that's a good idea
[04:57:01] <analagom> like, should i ask it from a diety figure
[04:57:23] <MissSugar> do you work with any specifically now?
[04:59:55] <analagom> well, my spiritual path has been buddhist, but i don't feel i can ask for love from the buddha. and, also from jesus

[05:00:09] <analagom> so i'm thinking of turning to a particular deity, like maybe some pagan god
[05:00:22] <analagom> but i could try the buddha
[05:00:29] <analagom> just doesn't feel right, but i haven't tried
[05:00:31] <MissSugar> well its probably best that you either stick to someone you have worked with before, or send it out into the universe
[05:00:37] <analagom> oh ok
[05:00:41] <analagom> thanks misssugar
[05:00:46] <analagom> you're da bomb
[05:00:46] <Hrafnbjorn> Buddha no longer exists, so youd be asking karma
[05:00:49] <MissSugar> np i hope it all works out for you
[05:01:04] <analagom> yea, but i don't know how to think of asking karma
[05:01:16] <analagom> but the universe works
[05:01:19] <XCuteWitchX> I cannot stress this enough, but be careful.
[05:01:35] <analagom> well, what are the pitfalls? and are they avoidable?
[05:01:41] <XCuteWitchX> A love spell can so easily backfire.
[05:01:57] <analagom> yea, so, my intentions are good
[05:02:05] <Hrafnbjorn> Bhagavad Gita says karma is Krishna, but I could not suggest working with beings ya havent tried to form relationship with in good ethics
[05:02:05] <analagom> if it doesn't work out, then i can accept that
[05:02:10] <raevynskyyemt> A love spell could get you stuck with a stalker

[05:02:29] <analagom> praying to cupid sounds kidna silly lol
[05:03:00] <MissSugar> LOL although that pool of energy would be rather large
[05:03:34] <XCuteWitchX> A love spell can also hurt someone if you toy with their emotions, if your intentions are not pure. I know from experience. I've been the victim.
[05:03:41] <Hrafnbjorn> I dont, personaly, think that you have to direct your prayers at a specific deity.  If they are concerned with matters of love they will hear the prayer... if not, they will hear it, but disregard it
[05:04:42] <MissSugar> you could also turn to the saints
[05:04:55] <MissSugar> if you are willing to work with jesus they will probably hear your prayer
[05:05:28] <raevynskyyemt> That's not how saints work
[05:05:45] <raevynskyyemt> They redirect the prayer to jesus
[05:05:55] <MissSugar> they actually redirect the prayers to god
[05:05:59] <raevynskyyemt> It's like going to an aunt to ask for something 
[05:06:12] <analagom> yea, but i'm not too familiar with the saints. my intentions are pure. if she will not love me then that's ok
[05:06:19] <MissSugar> but they do, do somethings on their own
[05:06:43] <analagom> i also have this issue, sounds silly, but there are other girls that seem to want my attention, and divert my enemies, or become and obstacle between me and her
[05:07:00] <analagom> i wonder how to factor this in the ritual, or should i just focus on her
[05:07:01] <XCuteWitchX> Analgom, say it does work. Ok. But that's the effects of your spell working, may not be her TRUE feelings. See where i'm going here?
[05:07:13] <analagom> yea, good point. good point
[05:07:36] <MissSugar> leave them out of it, if they are not interfering in your life
[05:07:40] <MissSugar> then dont bother with them
[05:07:43] <analagom> i see
[05:07:56] <analagom> alright, well i'll give it a shot, and see what happens
[05:08:11] <analagom> and if she turns out to become some zombie then i'll consider it a failed experiment
[05:08:20] <MissSugar> LOL i doubt that very much
[05:08:50] <raevynskyyemt> Lol
[05:09:04] <raevynskyyemt> If the world ends we know who to blame

[05:09:34] <Hrafnbjorn> nah, just let Alice Cooper bite ya ;)
[05:09:37] <MissSugar> if a love spell could do that teenagers would all be shuffling out of schools

[05:54:29] <North> solid plan
[05:54:42] <MissSugar> it is a good plan, my first plan involved ninjas 
[05:54:51] <MissSugar> this plan is way better
[05:54:53] <XCuteWitchX> That didn't sound right, but you know what I mean lol.
[05:54:56] <North> agreed
[05:55:22] <Hrafnbjorn> ninja's are to easy to defeat
[05:55:22] <North> roll of the dice with ninjas
[05:55:29] <Hrafnbjorn> just dont keep secrets
[05:55:30] <XCuteWitchX> I think I made the chat chaotic tonight haha.

[05:57:48] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> If you don't hear crickets outside, it's COLD!
[05:57:49] <North> do tell
[05:57:49] <XCuteWitchX> if its hotter than hell,, bam cricket lol
[05:58:27] <Hrafnbjorn> ya have to spend time listening to how many times the chirp at a given temperature, but once ya get baselines, they always chirp at same rate for a given temp
[05:58:30] <XCuteWitchX> No, if it's dead silent,... you're about to experience the frozenness that is Ohio,
[05:59:00] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Or Wisconsin, XCuteWitchX
[05:59:34] <Hrafnbjorn> so if ya find that they chirp say 2 times per second at X degrees, you can always listen, count and if it is 2 times per second, ya know its X degrees
[05:59:58] <SpiritSong> you kno, i havent heard crickets in years
[06:00:08] <SpiritSong> ireland much...
[06:01:04] <XCuteWitchX> I'm pastey white. I need to see the sun and tan. We need a summer. I look like a walking Elmers glue bottle.
[06:01:25] <SpiritSong> no summer where you are either?
[06:01:39] <Hrafnbjorn> supposed to be in 90's here tomorrow <sticks tongue out>
[06:01:47] <XCuteWitchX> Oh no theres summer. Try like 2 days of 90 degree weather then jump all the way back down
[06:02:27] <raevynskyyemt> I'll send this Montana weather your way hraf
[06:02:30] <XCuteWitchX> This is ohio.. we don't get a spring. It's usually just winter up until June and then jumps right into 80-90 degree weather.
[06:02:46] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ohio's a lot like Wisconsin, SpiritSong. Not much in the way of summer.

[06:06:47] <Keith> no it aint.  been in alberta all my life
[06:07:01] <Hrafnbjorn> the heat here is a ruthless killer
[06:07:05] <XCuteWitchX> or a lighter until they unthaw.... well you wouldn't have lids left lol
[06:07:08] <MissSugar> do you remember 2007 when it was so cold they shut down, down town calgary
[06:07:10] <MissSugar> because i do
[06:07:26] <Keith> that is like once a winter type weather
[06:07:36] <Keith> i was in brooks at that time
[06:07:51] <Keith> brooks, or her ein hanna
[06:08:21] <Hrafnbjorn> lol, keith ya dont wanna know what that means in Old Norsk
[06:08:23] <XCuteWitchX> So in a nutshell you grew up in Antarctica lol.
[06:08:25] <North> what does a city shutdown entail?
[06:08:29] <Hrafnbjorn> "ein hanna"
[06:08:43] <Keith> now you must tell me Hrafnbjorn lol
[06:08:44] <MissSugar> mostly businesses closing and limited bus service
[06:08:49] <North> ah, k
[06:08:55] <Hrafnbjorn> I will PM you if ok?
[06:08:58] <Keith> MissSugar and that was one really bad winter
[06:09:02] <Keith> go ahead
[06:09:11] <MissSugar> i was working at Nortel and they phoned me to tell me not to bother
[06:09:33] <raevynskyyemt> They just close the interstate here
[06:10:00] <North> how cold was it, then?
[06:10:20] <raevynskyyemt> Usually it's because of ice
[06:10:20] <MissSugar> -35 Celsius 
[06:10:27] <North> jeez louise
[06:10:37] <raevynskyyemt> But I've seen it get below - 40 Fahrenheit 
[06:10:42] <cyan> nooo
[06:10:53] <cyan> T.T
[06:10:57] <North> square tire weather
[06:11:04] <Keith> coldest we had around ehre was -53C i wanna say
[06:11:05] <MissSugar> LMFAO
[06:11:11] <Keith> that was long ago
[06:11:13] <SpiritSong> damn thats effen cold
[06:11:14] <MissSugar> im not your buddy pal
[06:11:20] <MissSugar> im not your pal guy
[06:11:22] <North> holy frijole, Keiffer
[06:11:24] <MissSugar> im not your guy buddy
[06:11:29] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Interesting bit of Trivia:L -40 is the one temp where the two scales are identical.
[06:11:30] <Hrafnbjorn> -40 is coldest I have been in, except maybe in Afghanistan but I didnt measure there, so I dunno
[06:12:17] <XCuteWitchX> can get up to -40 in ohio depending on the windchill factor and snow. It has happened in Ohio winters
[06:12:56] <Keith> we usually get at least one week of -40C/-40F per winter.... though over all this past winter was quite nice
[06:12:58] <raevynskyyemt> Montana actually has the biggest temperature difference. In all 50 states
[06:13:08] <XCuteWitchX> Although this year, we had spring in winter and winter in spring... So strange
[06:13:18] <raevynskyyemt> Mother nature is conduesed
[06:13:26] <raevynskyyemt> Confused 
[06:13:53] <cyan> and i thought it was cold this morning...
[06:13:58] <XCuteWitchX> lol
[06:14:07] <raevynskyyemt> I'm not sure it got below 0 here this year. And it's barely snowed 
[06:14:25] <XCuteWitchX> I'm shivering and cold as of now
[06:14:55] <cyan> i live in northern california so i really can't complain
[06:15:15] * Hrafnbjorn lives in northern Calif too
[06:15:19] <XCuteWitchX> I really want to live in LA
[06:15:31] <Keith> louisiana?
[06:15:39] <XCuteWitchX> Los Angeles
[06:15:43] <Keith> why there?
[06:16:03] <cyan> what part XCuteWitchX?
[06:16:09] <Hrafnbjorn> if state of Jefferson passes, LA is gonna dry up
[06:16:15] <cyan> and nice Hrafnbjorn ^_^
[06:16:36] <North> Mardis Gras
[06:16:37] <cyan> they'll just steal water from elsewhere...
[06:16:41] <XCuteWitchX> It's the city of music, Always dreamed of becoming a musician. But theres a one in a billion chance that'll ever happen. I can dream though.
[06:16:41] * North conjectures
[06:16:55] <Keith> XCuteWitchX why not try tennessee?
[06:17:01] <XCuteWitchX> I hate country
[06:17:09] <Keith> dont need to be country
[06:17:12] <Hrafnbjorn> Nashvile TN, and Austin TX are better places for music
[06:17:16] <North> nothing quite as life-affirming as the sight of various people staggering around in oversized papier mache headgear
[06:17:27] <XCuteWitchX> I'm more of a metal girl honestly.
[06:17:34] <Keith> gotchas
[06:17:41] <cyan> can you play or sing?
[06:18:05] <XCuteWitchX> I can't be on CMT singing evanescence haha. I can sing actually. So I've been told.
[06:18:10] <XCuteWitchX> ANd I've always enjoyed it.
[06:18:16] <cyan> nice
[06:18:28] <SpiritSong> any recordings?
[06:18:30] <cyan> well if you ever move to la...make sure you bring lots of money
[06:18:38] <cyan> it's expen$$$ive
[06:18:44] <Hrafnbjorn> Nashvile isnt just for country, it is the music capital of the US for all sorts of musics
[06:18:51] <XCuteWitchX> No. no recordings. I don't even know how to go about that.
[06:19:34] <Keith> XCuteWitchX just record some on a camera or a smart phone
[06:19:41] <Keith> put them on youtube or something
[06:20:20] <XCuteWitchX> I'm too shy and I do have stage fright. The only person I would sing for was my ex.
[06:20:58] <cyan> oh boi don't move to la
[06:21:13] <XCuteWitchX> I'm working on getting over that though.
[06:21:23] <Hrafnbjorn> the lady I dated when I lived in Minnesota sounded just like Loreena McKennit when she sang
[06:21:27] <SpiritSong> you willb get there :)
[06:21:43] <SpiritSong> oh nice Hrafnbjorn ^_^
[06:21:49] <North> incredible musician
[06:21:54] <Hrafnbjorn> tis why I dated her ;)
[06:22:44] <XCuteWitchX> I have a karaoke machine I sing on all the time so maybe some time I could record a voice memo on my phone.
[06:23:00] <North> <Ex>  "Hraf, would you mind handing me--"   <Hraf>  "Please phrase all questions in the form of a song."  
[06:23:05] <Keith> possibly
[06:23:16] <XCuteWitchX> lol North
[06:23:16] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[06:23:18] <cyan> if you have an iphone, there's an app called music memos that's really good
[06:23:27] <cyan> for quick recordings
[06:24:05] <Hrafnbjorn> ability to sing is a skill/talent I admire
[06:24:15] <XCuteWitchX> My favorite song to sing is.... let me get a link
[06:24:36] <cyan> i think most people do Hrafnbjorn
[06:24:48] <Keith> let me get a link?? never heard that one
[06:24:58] <SpiritSong> me too Hrafnbjorn
[06:25:04] <XCuteWitchX> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeawgwjjgC0
[06:25:41] <XCuteWitchX> Skip to 1:15 for the actual singing.
[06:25:51] <SpiritSong> i love that song
[06:26:14] <Hrafnbjorn> which song is it?  sorry, if I try to load youtube it boots me offline
[06:26:24] <XCuteWitchX> Good Enough by Evanescence
[06:26:34] <SpiritSong> it was one of the songs my high school choir used to sing...it was a catholic school but they sang rock instead of church music
[06:26:39] <Hrafnbjorn> ah, ok
[06:26:54] <SpiritSong> i wasnt in it though
[06:26:56] <North> that's a good 'un
[06:27:25] <XCuteWitchX> I also love Scream by new years day. I tried singing it but It doesn't match my style of singing (like amy lee does). And I didn't post this song because the lyrics are very...well not PG lol
[06:27:44] <Hrafnbjorn> the only son I have even sung infront of another person is the natl. anthem
[06:28:16] <Hrafnbjorn> son=song
[06:28:31] <cyan> singing is good for ya
[06:28:42] <SpiritSong>   you can sing Hrafnbjorn?
[06:29:09] <Hrafnbjorn> singing is required for galdr, but I have no ability to sing at all, so luckily galdr is private ;)
[06:29:15] <XCuteWitchX> IMO the provocative songs are always the funnest to sing lol.
[06:29:18] <Hrafnbjorn> no, I am terrible singer, lol
[06:29:45] <Hrafnbjorn> makes my nose vobrate, which makes my eyes water

[06:30:26] <XCuteWitchX> When singing, I always make sure to sing from my stomach, not lungs. Sounds weird but I was taught that.

[06:31:22] <cyan> yeah you have it right XCuteWitchX
[06:31:24] <North> <Hraf> *singing national anthem*   <Bystanders> *looking on with approval, mistaking the vibrating nose effect for patriotic fervour*
[06:31:26] <XCuteWitchX> see y- Keith: - poofs-
[06:31:38] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[06:32:31] <Hrafnbjorn> I think, to be honest, the standersby probably bled from the ears after
[06:32:38] <North> lol
[06:32:46] <cyan> singing from your diaphragm gives the voice strength and depth
[06:33:04] <XCuteWitchX> Nothing duct tape can't fix (Gets her redneck on if shes moving to Nashville)
[06:33:06] <cyan> practice scales with a piano to stay in key
[06:33:32] <North> duct tape: so many applications 
[06:33:36] * North can't help but marvel
[06:33:44] * AntleredGirl settles in
[06:34:25] * XCuteWitchX pokes Archr to see if he didn't die from her glitter bombs
[06:34:41] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> nope
[06:34:50] <cyan> glitter bombs *.*
[06:34:54] <XCuteWitchX> Oh I was prepared to raise hell ;)
[06:34:59] <North> Molly, any current knitting projects in the making?
[06:35:06] <cyan> AntleredGirl <3
[06:35:08] <XCuteWitchX> Thought you might've fell asleep :P
[06:35:10] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Listening to Evanescence
[06:35:41] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> My daughters took me to a concert a few years ago
[06:35:51] <AntleredGirl> cyan: Hiya!
[06:35:55] <XCuteWitchX> I know and I'm so envious!
[06:36:01] <AntleredGirl> North: I'm working on a shawl at the moment, yes. 
[06:36:11] <North> coolio
[06:36:42] <XCuteWitchX> One of my tats I want is their 'E' logo over my heart. They've been with me since I was really little. They've gotten me through a lot with just listening to their lyrics alone.
[06:36:45] <Hrafnbjorn> Ive only been to a few concerts, had great time at all of them, but I cant handle the crowds
[06:36:48] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Until then I didn't realize I'd actually heard them every week when I watched "Angel"
[06:37:10] <XCuteWitchX> Seen stevie nicks in concert as a little girl. Had lawn seats. Everything was breathtaking.
[06:37:20] <AntleredGirl> North: Very much so. Happy wonderful fluffy yarn.
[06:37:26] <North> :)
[06:37:34] <Hrafnbjorn> I would kill to see Stevie Nicks :(
[06:37:54] <XCuteWitchX> Oh I love crowds and wildness. I've been wanting to see Megadeth and motley crue for a while now.
[06:38:29] <Hrafnbjorn> I was never much into the hair bands
[06:38:47] * XCuteWitchX takes points off of awesomeness scale ;)
[06:39:19] <Hrafnbjorn> my interest in music actualy came pretty late
[06:39:32] <XCuteWitchX> Also wanted to see Manson in concert. I have a friend who would go with me. Shes a huge fan as well/
[06:39:55] <Hrafnbjorn> I bet that would be a good concert
[06:39:57] <North> 'hrafnbjorn' almost seems like the scandinavian word for 'hair band'
[06:40:11] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[06:40:18] <XCuteWitchX> Lol it would be very hmm.. "theatrical". Lets put it that way lol
[06:41:13] <Hrafnbjorn> Ive only seen Steve Miller/Doobie Bros... Grateful Dead... Janes Addiction... No Dobt... and Roger Waters
[06:41:39] <Hrafnbjorn> *Doubt
[06:41:56] <XCuteWitchX> Those are all amazing except I'm not familiar with Roger Waters or Grateful Dead
[06:42:14] <Hrafnbjorn> Roger Waters = Pink Floyd
[06:42:31] <XCuteWitchX> OH! Yeah. Light bulb went off lol
[06:42:42] <Hrafnbjorn> he just wasnt with the band anymore when I saw him
[06:43:20] <XCuteWitchX> aka trippy music :P
[06:43:30] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[06:43:43] <SpiritSong> brb finishing a knit project
[06:43:58] <MissSugar> sweet
[06:44:06] <Hrafnbjorn> it was Pink Floyd's "The Wall" album, mixxed with some potent intoxicants that turned me on to music
[06:44:07] * XCuteWitchX is jelly because i'd love to make my own clothing.
[06:44:24] <XCuteWitchX> LOL, I bet, Hraf.
[06:44:52] <North> whatcha knittin', Birdy?
[06:45:30] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> My own favorite group is ....
[06:45:37] * XCuteWitchX drum rolls
[06:45:39] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The Moody Blues
[06:46:02] <North> <-- evidently unfamiliar with the brb acronym
[06:46:45] <Hrafnbjorn> ugh, I am soo kicking myself right now!!!!
[06:47:11] <North> I used to hate it when radio stations would cut the spoken intro to 'Ride My See Saw'
[06:47:11] <Hrafnbjorn> just saw comercial that the new Star Wars came out on bluray today, and I didnt buy it!!
[06:47:30] <raevynskyyemt> I pre-ordered it on digital a while ago
[06:47:33] <cyan> i saw marilyn manson in concert once...not may thing
[06:47:38] <cyan> but definitely theatrical
[06:47:38] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Indeed, North
[06:47:46] <raevynskyyemt> And got it it on the 1st 
[06:48:20] <XCuteWitchX> Was the concert good, Cyan?
[06:48:22] <Hrafnbjorn> go ahead and throw salt in the wound, raevynskyyemt, lol
[06:48:23] <North> should be tons of copies floating around out there, Hraf
[06:48:52] <XCuteWitchX> uTorrent, Hraf ;)
[06:48:58] <Hrafnbjorn> probably North, I just have to brave walmart to buy it here... I shoulda bought it before I got home
[06:49:03] <cyan> ummm i think if you're into Manson, then yeah it would be very good
[06:49:18] <XCuteWitchX> Lol, I mean like did they sound good live?
[06:49:24] <North> I picked up a copy this morning...didn't appear to be any mad rush
[06:49:25] <cyan> he had lots of burlesque dancers, fire, theatrics and such
[06:49:37] <XCuteWitchX> I figured, They put on one helluva show
[06:49:39] <cyan> it sounded like his recorded stuff, so yeah
[06:49:53] <cyan> it's just not my thing ya know
[06:49:58] <North> I hear ya, though -  lining up is a pain and a half
[06:50:58] <XCuteWitchX> Oh that reminds me, I know a movie I could watch, the saw series, lol.
[06:51:08] <cyan> oh boi
[06:51:09] <cyan> lol
[06:51:31] <XCuteWitchX> I actually don't bat an eye when gore comes on.
[06:52:33] <cyan> it gives me nightmares
[06:53:16] <XCuteWitchX> When I have nightmares, Instead of getting scared, I find them interesting. I'm a strange individual lol.
[06:54:27] <cyan> that's okay. we're all different
[06:54:32] <cyan> and the same :P
[06:54:53] <XCuteWitchX> Like, I like to figure out why I had the nightmares. They intrigue me
[06:55:46] <XCuteWitchX> I just read a quote from manson that was right on point.
[06:55:48] <AntleredGirl> My nightmares are teachers. 
[06:56:39] <XCuteWitchX> "I'm against religion, because religion teaches us to be okay with not understanding the world. "  Although i'm wiccan, even I doubt and question things.
[06:57:55] <North> <Nightmare>  "2 + 2 = 5."   <Molly>  :o   <Nightmare>  "Remain after class."   <Molly>   :O

[17:50:47] <ronin> hi Iona
[17:50:53] <ronin> ah Witchit
[17:50:59] <ronin> that's kind of a real life sad thing going on
[17:51:07] <Witchit> Nah, I gotcha :)
[17:51:19] <Witchit> I have ghost friends too, as strange as that sounds
[17:51:21] <ronin> i would love to change the past right now
[17:51:33] <Iona> It doesnt sound odd, Witchit 
[17:51:35] <Witchit> Is everything okay?
[17:51:57] <AvisBird> ronin i wont tell you not to because its your choice but i wouldnt recomend it
[17:52:06] <Witchit> Thank you :) I have ghosts living in my house and constantly in my dreams, so it's great to help them out
[17:52:16] <ronin> well forcing things is a bad idea
[17:52:30] <AvisBird> it really is
[17:52:32] <Witchit> Oh...you're forcing yourself on the ghosts?
[17:52:44] <Iona> I don't think that's what he's saying Witchit 
[17:52:57] <Witchit> Sorry, I just came to the conversation :/
[17:53:12] <ronin> no to force like a change in what happened in real life
[17:53:16] <ronin> nnot that that is possible
[17:53:26] <Witchit> Oh...
[17:53:52] <Witchit> I hope everything turns out fine, whatever problem it is
[17:54:06] <AvisBird> i feel ya ronin
[17:54:07] <AvisBird> :/
[17:54:10] <Witchit> It's hard when you act impulsive on something
[17:54:17] <ronin> that's what happened
[17:54:20] <Iona> ronin: the past is.  making peace with the past is rough for most people.
[17:54:27] <Witchit> Exactly Iona
[17:54:42] <Witchit> I can't even get over the simplest things. But it's about being patient
[17:54:58] <ronin> and it takes time
[17:55:03] <ronin> as the mind knows but
[17:55:04] <Witchit> It's also about taking action, which is weird
[17:55:38] <Witchit> If you get what I'm saying, it's good to take action with positive steps, and be patient towards the change
[17:56:09] <ronin> well it's why people advise one day at a time
[17:56:23] <Iona> ronin, are you going to approach the future differently?  and is it the posture for the future which does the most good for you and others?
[17:56:26] <ronin> like when something shocking happens or overcoming an addiction or sickness
[17:56:28] <Witchit> Actually, I hate that phrase
[17:56:35] <Witchit> Don't count the days
[17:56:58] <ronin> it shocked me into realizing what could happen
[17:57:28] <AvisBird> sounds like it truelly was a shocl to you :/ it was sudden
[17:57:43] <Iona> Isn't being aware beautiful?
[17:57:43] <Witchit> Well it might be useful to explain what happened :P
[17:58:10] <Iona> it's sad, but that's how it goes; it's still beautiful.
[17:58:14] <Witchit> Being aware is beautiful. Counting pages is not
[17:59:09] <Witchit> It's kind of like an author writing a book and someone randomly saying 'now write just an 100 page book'
[17:59:23] <Witchit> It's a lot of pressure to think about each page
[17:59:29] <ronin> oh
[17:59:50] <Witchit> Don't count the days, focus on just being you
[18:00:03] <Witchit> That's just my advice :)
[18:00:14] <ronin> well i see Voltzen is in here too
[18:00:25] <AvisBird> ronin are you and your mutual friends going to do something in his memory/
[18:00:33] <Witchit> Whoa whoa whoa
[18:00:37] <Witchit> Did someone die?
[18:00:48] <ronin> yes
[18:00:55] <Witchit> I didn't know...
[18:01:12] <ronin> thats what i meant
[18:01:21] <Witchit> I just came into the conversation
[18:01:27] <ronin> i think i need to know his funeral time
[18:01:33] <ronin> i was at the viewing
[18:01:37] <Witchit> Oh...
[18:02:12] <Witchit> I asked for an explanation, but I understand now
[18:02:25] <ronin> that's why i was kinda like that
[18:02:27] <AvisBird> i didnt realise he lived near enough to you. is there someone who can give you the funeral details?
[18:02:36] <Witchit> I lost a good friend a few years ago to suicide
[18:02:44] <Witchit> I wish you all the best
[18:03:11] <Witchit> I can relate to losing a friend, though I'm not in your shoes
[18:03:13] <AvisBird> :( im sorry to hear that Witchit
[18:04:01] <Witchit> It was especially bad because beforehand he let out a youtube video saying 'none of you are stupid. You are all wonderful people, and there's something special inside you.'
[18:04:15] <Witchit> He made a beautiful speech I could never replicate
[18:04:17] <AvisBird> he sounds like a wonderful person 
[18:04:23] <Witchit> He really was :)
[18:05:17] <AvisBird> :)
[18:06:08] <Witchit> ronin, the loss of a friend is awful. I'm glad you're aware of your feelings
[18:06:41] <Witchit> It took me a few months to get out of denial, but it's different for everyone
[18:07:14] <Witchit> If you EVER need someone to talk to, I'm here any time
[18:07:28] <Iona> Witchit: you're not supposed to jump into de'Nile...  
[18:07:42] <Witchit> Oh my god Iona XD
[18:07:44] <AvisBird> same here, if you need an ear, im here
[18:07:57] <AvisBird> iona you and your puns
[18:08:17] *** Iona is now known as Iona`and`my`puns
[18:08:24] <AvisBird> lol
[18:08:26] <AvisBird> :P
[18:08:29] <ronin> rght
[18:08:34] <Witchit> At first I didn't get it and I'm all YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
[18:08:38] <ronin> can i talk to you about something else?
[18:08:45] <Witchit> Go right ahead dude :)
[18:08:53] <AvisBird> go ahead
[18:08:59] <ronin> well is Avis aka someone else?
[18:09:10] <AvisBird> spiritsong
[18:09:19] <Witchit> I'm fine with it
[18:09:27] <ronin> oh :)
[18:09:28] <Witchit> But whoever you want to talk to is fine :)
[18:09:44] <ronin> i know Avis
[18:10:02] <Witchit> Also, I don't think spiritsong is here :/
[18:10:20] <Witchit> WAIT
[18:10:25] <Witchit> OH MY GOD I JUST GOT THAT
[18:10:48] <ronin> mind a pm SpiritSong
[18:10:50] <ronin> i hate to
[18:11:02] <AvisBird> go ahead 
[18:11:04] <AvisBird> :)
[18:14:34] *** Iona`and`my`puns is now known as Iona
[18:14:59] <Witchit> I'm so sad....aside from the heavy topic we're having I lost the art contest. It's not as heavy but still kind of sucks. Oh well :P
[18:15:12] <Iona> Awww....
[18:15:17] * Iona hugs Witchit
[18:15:23] <Witchit> -hugs back-
[18:15:29] <Witchit> I lost to contemporary art
[18:15:34] <Witchit> Which hurts even more
[18:16:01] <Witchit> None of my friends won either, which also sucks because they are AMAZING
[18:16:10] <AvisBird> Witchit, don't see it as a loss. you got to show your work and it was amazing. you didnt win the prize but you were still accepted into the contest and that was quite an acchomplishment imo
[18:16:25] <Witchit> Thanks :) I forget that sometimes
[18:16:56] <Witchit> But on the bright side, I was so good I was apparently called back for next year
[18:17:05] <Iona> Yep.  Keep at it, and you'll eventually get the recognition you seek...
[18:17:11] <Witchit> :D
[18:17:31] <Witchit> Another good thing is the video game I'm making out of my comic
[18:17:42] <Witchit> Which is like this point and click adventure game
[18:18:13] <Iona> those are enjoying a resurgence on smartphones &c
[18:18:15] <Witchit> I'm so excited to release it once it's done ^ ^
[18:18:38] <Witchit> Well, I won't really release it on a smartphone
[18:18:43] <Witchit> Or steam or anything :P
[18:18:59] <Witchit> But I am excited to accomplish it
[18:19:24] <Iona> :)
[18:19:38] <Witchit> I'm also making really bad poetry for fun XD Like, parody stuff
[18:20:01] <Witchit> I wrote an entire poem on stairs. It was amazing
[18:20:24] <AvisBird> Witchit, exactly...keep that thought and dont let the dissapointment discourage you
[18:20:40] <AvisBird> you should post your poems someplace
[18:20:41] <AvisBird> :P
[18:21:31] <Witchit> Thanks AvisBird/SpiritSong? I really want to release it when ready. It would be so much fun to make fun of recent poetry
[18:21:38] <Witchit> Modern poetry to me is AWFUL
[18:21:49] <Iona> Roses are red, violets are blue. Peonies are both, all just for you.
[18:21:56] <AvisBird> hehhe
[18:22:05] <Witchit> That's possibly better than my parody poetry XD

[22:22:21] <Edward> What game is that?
[22:22:25] <Edward> Sort looks like oblivion
[22:22:29] <DawnBat> it is
[22:22:36] <Edward> Oh it is oblivion, hahaha
[22:22:36] <DawnBat> but with missing water textures xD\
[22:22:52] <Edward> The picture is pretty fuzzy
[22:23:12] <DawnBat> I have a mod so it lowers the res
[22:23:27] <Edward> In game, or only on the photo?
[22:23:34] <DawnBat> Here's one of my old characters : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=657798379
[22:23:41] <DawnBat> The game since i use a graphical mod
[22:23:48] <Edward> Nice
[22:23:55] <Edward> I have a few mods installed
[22:24:03] <Edward> Qarls texture pack, and oblivion reloaded
[22:24:09] <Edward> And that UI mod, forget its name
[22:24:13] <DawnBat> DarnUI?
[22:24:18] <Edward> Yesh
[22:24:20] <DawnBat> I also have Oblivion Reloaded
[22:24:27] <DawnBat> we should get Oblivion Online :P
[22:24:37] <Edward> Oblivion Online?
[22:24:53] <DawnBat> yeah
[22:25:00] <DawnBat> it plugs oblivion into the interwebs
[22:25:06] <DawnBat> it's probably only good for friends now

[22:26:16] <DawnBat> It was
[22:26:20] <DawnBat> but wonky too
[22:26:36] <Edward> I perfer the morrowind overhaul, myself
[22:27:10] <Quad> hey dawn
[22:27:12] <DawnBat> I had 200+ mods for Skyrim once xD
[22:27:15] <DawnBat> hey Quadzie
[22:27:20] <DawnBat> NO!
[22:27:25] <DawnBat> Quadling :)
[22:27:30] <Quad> got a fallout build for you
[22:27:35] <DawnBat> wait waht
[22:27:37] <Edward> I have a few mods for Skyrim but i started to get black textures.
[22:27:42] <DawnBat> which game though Quad
[22:27:47] <Quad> 4
[22:27:50] <Quad> duh
[22:27:51] <DawnBat> I quit Skyrim
[22:27:55] <DawnBat> Quad: I can't play FO4
[22:27:58] <Edward> Why did you quit skyrim?
[22:28:13] <DawnBat> meh, just boring and if I did want to play it;d be pointless to install.
[22:28:14] <Quad> it might work on 3
[22:28:19] <DawnBat> cause then I'd quit
[22:28:24] <DawnBat> and uninstall
[22:28:30] <Edward> I put skyrim on hold until after I get a better graphics card.
[22:28:31] <DawnBat> Quad: I only have New Vegas installed right now
[22:28:33] <Edward> I need more vram
[22:28:38] <Edward> In order to run it with all meh mods
[22:28:41] <Edward> And not be buggy.
[22:29:05] <Quad> i don't run mods
[22:29:13] <DawnBat> becaus Quadling is a peasant :D
[22:29:21] <Quad> and the build still works
[22:29:38] <Quad> mods are for ppl with no gaming skill
[22:29:43] <Edward> Dude...
[22:29:45] <DawnBat> Quad: That's not true
[22:29:53] <Quad> so true
[22:29:54] <DawnBat> there's mods for.
[22:29:55] <Edward> Do you even know what mods are?!
[22:29:56] <DawnBat> EVERYTHING
[22:30:24] <Edward> Mods are like the BEST part of pc gaming, apart from the games looking FABULOUSSSss
[22:30:29] <Quad> if you can't play it without your precious mods, you're not a true gamer
[22:30:40] <DawnBat> the Quadling has stronk opinions
[22:30:58] <Edward> I usually install mods after I get bored with the game
[22:31:12] <Quad> anyway, try a riddick build
[22:31:19] <Quad> it's awesome

[22:32:37] <Edward> Thats alot cooler than your filthy riddick
[22:32:41] <Quad> why would i need a light saber?
[22:32:42] <DawnBat> I really don't care for Chronicles of Riddick

[22:35:31] <Edward> Quad, do you know what mods are?
[22:35:31] <DawnBat> Edward is a mod
[22:35:42] <Edward> They dont have to tweak the gameplay
[22:35:49] <Edward> They can just add a bunch of cool ass stuff
[22:36:16] <Quad> mod is a modification or alteratiopn to the game
[22:36:31] <Quad> which i don't need
[22:36:42] <Edward> You're weird
