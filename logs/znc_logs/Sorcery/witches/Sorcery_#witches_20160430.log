[03:20:28] <SpiritSong> is it a type of bracelet?
[03:21:11] <Hrafnbjorn> thanks... yeah, sometimes called an arm-ring
[03:21:30] <SpiritSong> what was the nordic name used or was it nordic
[03:21:41] <Hrafnbjorn> in Heathenism they are used for oathing
[03:22:09] <Hrafnbjorn> eiÃ°ahringr, means oath ring
[03:22:11] <SpiritSong> ahh so you would recieve one upon your oating?
[03:23:32] <Hrafnbjorn> youd traditionaly recieve one at a ritual of coming of age, then when ya make an oath, it is done over the ring, and the ring kinda contains the oaths of your life... there were other things oaths were placed upon too, but the oath ring was most important
[03:25:39] <SpiritSong> is this practice still dont?
[03:26:26] <SpiritSong> done
[03:27:45] <Hrafnbjorn> I only know a few Heathens that do it, and even then they didnt recieve it upon coming of age... there are far nicer comercial ones that are made molded, and have wolf head, or raven terminals.  The one I made is just twisted wire, so theres no soldering or welding, its all just held together by the twists

[03:38:46] <Hrafnbjorn> I could build a forge, but I could only use it in winter, it would be illegal to use here in  summer
[03:38:56] <SpiritSong> is that easy enough to get though

[18:57:39] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, it is simply a type of marriage ritual in which a cord or scarf id tied, or placed over the hands of the folk being married.  Now, it is considered a pre-marriage done by un-ordained neo-pagan pseudo priests

[18:58:10] <H-> ah yes

[18:59:16] <Hrafnbjorn> the typical marriage ritual in the Anglo cultures today comes from Scandinavia, taken to the Brittish Isles during the Danelaw... the handfasting is more typical of central Europe, and pre-Danish Brittish Isles

[20:00:15] <H-> During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed nearly 20,000,000 U.S. gallons (75,700,000 L) of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos, and parts of Cambodia as part of the aerial defoliation program known as Operation Ranch Hand, reaching its peak from 1967 to 1969.[42][43][44] Like the British did in Malaya, the goal was to defoliate
[20:00:17] <H-> rural/forested land, depriving guerrillas of food and cover and clearing sensitive areas such as around base perimeters.[45] The program was also a part of a general policy of forced draft urbanization, which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, forcing them to flee to the U.S. dominated cities, depriving the guerrillas of their rural support
[20:00:19] <H-> base.[43][46]
[20:00:22] <H-> I'll stop spamming lol
[20:01:02] <H-> basically, kill the land, kill the people
[20:01:08] <H-> in that order
[20:01:23] <SpiritSong> smh
[20:01:26] <SpiritSong> its digusting
[20:01:51] <H-> it is, you know whats even worse ? I never learned this in school, nor has anyone I know
[20:02:25] <H-> it doesnt fit the good image that has been created I guess
[20:03:48] <SpiritSong> i didnt learn it in school either
[20:04:18] <SpiritSong> i did a bit in college. the ecology professor was very in favour of protecting the enviroment
[20:05:10] <SpiritSong> please dont ask me what i learned....i didnt pay attention in that class...it was at 6 pm, with a 6 am start to the day and i was always sleepy haha
[20:05:28] <H-> :P
[20:06:40] <H-> so much bullsh*t, lies and not telling things in schools.. I think people are required to take the so called *red pill* and wake up
[20:07:10] <SpiritSong> lol they tell us lies in history class too
[20:07:31] <H-> ofcourse, they keep telling lies
[20:07:58] <H-> and not a word about pagans or anything.. nooo, that doesnt fit the picture
[20:08:10] <H-> the witch hunt is covered though
[20:08:26] <SpiritSong> we had pagans in school
[20:08:58] <SpiritSong> but we were taught about how st bridget...or was itt florence nightingale...who converted a pagan king
[20:09:00] <H-> we didnt.. small village, small school, small class of indoctrinated little drones ;)
[20:09:11] <SpiritSong> we were thought that a pagan was someone who didnt believe in god
[20:09:14] <SpiritSong> taught
[20:09:21] <H-> lol
[20:09:34] <H-> ah yes.. because there is only one god huh :P
[20:09:36] <H-> ah well
[20:10:08] <SpiritSong> haha yep
[20:10:19] <H-> I got kicked out of class once because I dared to question creationism
[20:10:34] <H-> that was the turning point for me to be honest
[20:10:41] <H-> I must've been 6 or 7
[20:11:06] <SpiritSong> wow..couldnt handle their beliefs being challenged eh?
[20:11:12] <H-> nope, not at all
[20:11:19] <SpiritSong> its always the ones who feel shakey in their own beliefs who get mad :P
[20:11:27] <SpiritSong> and that goes for any faith
[20:11:31] <SpiritSong> even some pagans
[20:11:47] <SpiritSong> so not saying it is only christian peeps. a lot of them are cool
[20:11:47] <H-> indeed, I've had great discussions with christians, great people not afraid or insecure
[20:11:57] <SpiritSong> exactly!!!
[20:12:26] <H-> but forcing something on to me and not accepting any form of questioning is a no go for me
[20:12:49] <SpiritSong> exactly
[20:12:57] <SpiritSong> it doesnt get anyone anywhere
[20:13:06] <H-> they couldn't see that ;)
[20:13:23] <H-> those people do more harm than good, even though they think the other way around
[20:13:45] <SpiritSong> i know
[20:14:10] <SpiritSong> :/ they dont see that a mutually respectful conversation is going to yield more positve results
[20:19:35] <H-> indeed

[21:21:54] <North> the Enjoyment/Pain In The Ass ratio was about 30/70
[21:22:10] <Keith> not bad at all
[21:22:24] <Alyria> I have had cats that have been more worth it than this cat.

[21:23:30] <Alyria> Not in her favor - she doesn't play, she pukes on the floor, she squawks instead of meows, drags cat litter everywhere, she doesn't like being picked up, and she doesn't like being petted.
[21:23:40] <Alyria> Pros - cute to look at, sometimes nice to pet
[21:23:57] <Alyria> Oh and she gets colds and sneezes cat snot into your face.

[23:48:16] * North jumps on the ole bandwagon
[23:48:32] <Keith> so do you just re-arrange the crystals t suit your need TheAllison?
[23:48:40] <TheAllison> aye
[23:48:57] <Keith> sweet.
[23:48:57] <North> Deargael, I like ALL the turquoise ones
[23:49:03] <TheAllison> and the general crystal care, I cleanse, consecrate and charge my stones before each use
[23:49:20] <North> including the darker green ones
[23:49:57] <Keith> lots of work
[23:50:01] <TheAllison> Northsies, there isn't a single bit of turquoise in ANY of those grids because I have an uncanny aversion to turquoise and literally only have ONE bit in my collection that is valued at over 10G
[23:50:16] <North> !
[23:50:28] <North> this monitor may be a bit effed, then
[23:50:42] <Keith> what are the bluey greeny ones then?
[23:50:44] <North> or possibly my actual eyes
[23:51:09] <TheAllison> which griddd are they in?
[23:51:11] <Keith> the ones that pour into the single stones
[23:52:21] <Keith> like if you look from the outside in... you have the inverted tear drop, the the other bluey green curved in tear drops..
[23:52:29] <North> the ones I'm referring to were in that first link, btw
[23:52:34] <TheAllison> the pentacle one? the green small stones made into flourishes?
[23:52:41] <Keith> the first one
[23:52:48] <TheAllison> that's green adventurine
[23:53:00] <North> I love that that's an actual name     
[23:53:08] <Keith> hehe
[23:53:39] <TheAllison> lol
