[02:31:56] <DawnBat> wb
[02:32:02] <DawnBat> So found an interesting thing
[02:32:06] <DawnBat> the haka
[02:32:35] <Hrafnbjorn> ok
[02:32:44] <DawnBat> Maori Ancestral War Cry
[02:33:44] <DawnBat> Polynesian warriors seem uber scary
[02:34:31] <Hrafnbjorn> all warriors are potentialy scary... some are just more dramatic, and put on a bigger show
[02:35:05] <DawnBat> usually a bigger show is more terrifying.
[02:35:12] <DawnBat> But Polynesian weaponry was brutal as well.
[02:35:21] <DawnBat> And they're huge guys
[02:36:15] <Hrafnbjorn> they are large on average, yeah
[02:36:46] <DawnBat> you know what'd be scary
[02:36:57] <DawnBat> Polynesian Berserker
[02:37:38] <Hrafnbjorn> no weapon is more brutal than another though... lethal is lethal.  Much of what folk consider brutal is actualy quit impractical to be honest... simplicity rules on the battlefield, so all the stuff with spikes stickin out everywhere and such are more meant for intimidation that actual usefulness
[02:37:55] <DawnBat> oh
[02:38:40] <DawnBat> Still
[02:38:48] <Hrafnbjorn> take the shark tooth clubs used by the Aztec warriors... they are easily defeated with a piece of string
[02:38:53] <DawnBat> Beaten with fish bones and teeth sounds excruciating compared to metal
[02:39:07] <Hrafnbjorn> why?
[02:39:24] <DawnBat> I'd always imagine bone and teeth to be sharper than metals
[02:39:27] <Hrafnbjorn> their weapon would be useless half way through a battle
[02:39:55] <DawnBat> also
[02:39:59] <Hrafnbjorn> not even close... good steel can be almost a single molecule thick on the edge
[02:39:59] <DawnBat> Maori could ride whales
[02:40:14] <Hrafnbjorn> only thing sharper than good steel is volcanic glasses
[02:40:29] <DawnBat> that's fragile though
[02:40:36] * Hrafnbjorn sighs... they did not ride whales, thats a mythic story
[02:41:01] <DawnBat> Really?
[02:41:08] <DawnBat> I saw a lot of results sooo
[02:42:01] <Hrafnbjorn> you can ride a whale for a very short moment, until it decides to dive to get you off its back, then ya have to let go
[02:42:08] <DawnBat> Ah
[02:42:28] <Hrafnbjorn> just like folk that ride sharks... works until it wants you to get off, then you have no choice but to let go
[02:43:36] <DawnBat> oh
[02:44:02] <DawnBat> Side Note : http://imgur.com/a/XyM7t Did these
[02:44:08] <Hrafnbjorn> and with whales, depending on type, they can kill you just with sound, so they dont even have to dive

[02:50:44] <Hrafnbjorn> I am probably wasting  my time with this article, but who knows... it probably wont be well welcomed because folk have a skewed perspective of Freyr (and his twin Freyja)
