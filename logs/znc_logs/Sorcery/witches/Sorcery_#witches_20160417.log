[05:55:19] <Abraxas> Welcome, QuietOne. The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.
[05:55:44] <DawnBat> I'm upset right now cause I can never have a seemingly happy relationship that lasts. There's ALWAYS some kind of major complication
[05:56:11] <Quadpod88> is that a major complication?
[05:56:19] <Quadpod88> one date night?
[05:56:25] <DawnBat> Yes
[05:56:29] <DawnBat> Caue this always happens
[05:56:46] <DawnBat> I only get to see my fiancee usually once a week for prety much usually an hour
[05:57:11] <Quadpod88> and this troubles you
[05:57:24] <DawnBat> Yes
[05:57:49] <Quadpod88> have you discussed it with your fiance?
[05:58:01] <DawnBat> there's no logical solution at this current time
[05:58:22] <Quadpod88> logic can be a pain at times
[05:58:38] <MissSugar> if you want peace then i would suggest cinnamon 
[05:58:46] <DawnBat> Tempted to give up on relationships as a whole, become a hermit and wait for The Apocalypse
[05:59:08] <MissSugar> the smell relaxes anyone who smells it and puts them in a peaceful state of mind
[05:59:26] <Quadpod88> so, because you're not having this one night, you just give up?

[05:59:53] <Iona> Deprivation is no fun
[06:00:15] <DawnBat> boredom seems to be a better alternative than unhappiness
[06:00:22] <MissSugar> hey Iona 
[06:00:39] <Quadpod88> boredom is a form of unhappiness
[06:01:14] <Quadpod88> but i see your point
[06:01:18] <Iona> Hello MissSugar 
[06:01:43] <DawnBat> This universe is sick and curel
[06:01:47] <Iona> How are you today?
[06:02:04] <Quadpod88> the question is, do you really want to end a good relationship over a minor inconveinience
[06:02:41] <Quadpod88> no, the universe is fair, humans are cruel
[06:02:45] <MissSugar> i am well, how is yourself 
[06:02:47] <Iona> Pro tip - you have to Work at relationships when they are rocky
[06:03:05] <Iona> I'm OK, thanks for asking MissSugar 
[06:03:23] <DawnBat> I think being a dying star on the way to black hole status would be more enjoyable
[06:03:30] <Quadpod88> i've been with the same girl for 10 years, and it gets rocky
[06:04:09] <Quadpod88> things get hard
[06:04:16] <DawnBat> For Horror Fans : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy9uaWqUNa8
[06:04:25] <Quadpod88> sometimes the ones you love just can't be there
[06:05:51] <Quadpod88> this will only make your relationship stronger
[06:06:27] <Iona> I knew someone once...
[06:06:42] <DawnBat> that vid btw seemed like MissSugar would enjoy
[06:06:42] <Quadpod88> vague
[06:06:45] <Iona> Who would only see their SO once a month...
[06:07:04] <Iona> And when they did, they went all out on things
[06:08:13] <DawnBat> Fianceee and I are poor. 
[06:08:14] <Iona> Its totally doable. Make it a special time if you can, and if not, its okay too - the important thing is to not give up and to not give in to doubts

[10:15:45] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Lucky you
[10:15:57] <CantSirDraggin> it's not luck, it's rum
[10:16:11] <CantSirDraggin> and the afternoon nap expiring its usefullness
[10:16:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> So, I came here, found some intelligence, and also a talking pinata
[10:16:25] <CantSirDraggin> i assume in seperate packages
[10:16:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Of course
[10:17:31] <CantSirDraggin> i found a bunch of top 15 creepiest vids and some bacardi
[10:18:10] <CantSirDraggin> apparently by a canadian who is carefull to not overpronounce the u in his words
[10:18:44] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Was it fun?
[10:18:50] <CantSirDraggin> interesting
[10:19:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ok
[10:19:06] <CantSirDraggin> likely more fakes stories than not, but the narrarator agreed
[10:19:16] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ah
[10:19:58] <CantSirDraggin> good creepy stuff for around 3am while drinking though
[10:20:13] <CantSirDraggin> nothing that will inspire dreams likely
[10:21:00] <CantSirDraggin> i may however miss at least a good chunk of the local pagan coffee thing due to the hours though
[10:21:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Bummer
[10:21:27] <CantSirDraggin> kinda indifferent really
[10:21:55] <CantSirDraggin> really just an excuse to get out of the apt while not working
[10:22:39] <CantSirDraggin> it's nearly exclusively couples between my age and yours
[10:22:58] <CantSirDraggin> and the sunday coffee is just random chatter
[10:24:14] <CantSirDraggin> the other local pagan group, which apparently has single peeps too, meets once a month before i get off of work on saturdays, heh
[10:25:13] <CantSirDraggin> just as well, won't offer potential moving complications that way come this fall or so
[10:25:36] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> True
[10:26:16] <CantSirDraggin> need to go see the toyota dealer the next city over and see what the catch is on the $50/mo new vehichles
[10:26:57] <CantSirDraggin> would slow down my savings a bit, but i need to get out of my 25 year old van before i go too
[10:27:27] <CantSirDraggin> nothing down, no credit check....there has to be some catch
[10:27:46] <CantSirDraggin> hopefully it's unsold models from last year or the year before
[10:28:58] <CantSirDraggin> i'd be upside down in the loan like forever at that rate of payment, but w/e
[10:32:56] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> $50 a month?
[10:33:06] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I agree, there's gotta be a catch
[10:33:15] <CantSirDraggin> that's what the radio commercial said
[10:33:50] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Caveat emptor, bud
[10:33:57] <CantSirDraggin> well, ya
[10:34:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Is this dealer a Greek?
[10:34:29] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> See what I did, there?
[10:34:34] <CantSirDraggin> it's a new toyota lot, and i don't think so
[10:35:37] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ok
[10:35:49] <CantSirDraggin> could just be a few 14's left on the lot for all i know
[10:35:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Still, sounds too good to be true
[10:36:16] <CantSirDraggin> and siennas and tundras weren't mentioned, and they'd be all i was interested in
[10:36:18] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Might be, at a greatly reduced price
[10:36:55] <CantSirDraggin> that or add an extra thousand and a half to have stuff moved for me
