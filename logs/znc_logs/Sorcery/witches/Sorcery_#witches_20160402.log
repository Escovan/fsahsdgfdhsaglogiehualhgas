[00:09:19] <Keith> thank you my friend
[00:09:23] <North> o/

[00:10:24] <BansheeTears> Coffee
[00:10:30] * Keith sips his tea
[00:10:39] <BansheeTears> Unless the offer is better than coffee
[00:10:48] <Keith> and that is why you should drink tea.  it is easier to spell
[00:10:58] <BansheeTears> Made a nice tea last night
[00:11:16] <BansheeTears> Lemon balm and chamomile
[00:11:17] <Keith> what kind??
[00:11:23] <Keith> ohhhhhh nice and relaxing
[00:11:36] <BansheeTears> Yup clipped it myself :)
[00:11:41] <Keith> even better
[00:11:58] <BansheeTears> Lovely stuff
[00:12:10] <BansheeTears> Weaning off my sleep aid
[00:12:23] <BansheeTears> So good teas will come in handy
[00:12:35] <Keith> i wish you the best of luck :D
[00:12:42] <BansheeTears> Thanks
[00:12:44] <North> some have called chamomile a sleep aid
[00:12:47] <BansheeTears> On day 2
[00:13:13] <BansheeTears> It helps, but it's nothing like tamazapam Óêâ
[00:13:28] <Keith> is that your sleep aid?
[00:13:33] <BansheeTears> Yup
[00:13:43] <BansheeTears> Highest dose
[00:13:57] <Keith> holy crap
[00:14:10] <North> dream-suppressing, I hear
[00:14:14] <BansheeTears> It keeps me asleep through pain
[00:14:35] <North> what does the pain stem from, if you don't mind me asking?
[00:14:36] <BansheeTears> I have vivid dreams, but the control isn't there as much
[00:14:45] <BansheeTears> Back pain
[00:14:51] <BansheeTears> Lower lumbar
[00:14:51] <North> ah
[00:14:54] <North> sorry to hear
[00:15:03] <BansheeTears> It's old news
[00:15:12] <BansheeTears> I'm used to it during the day
[00:15:29] <BansheeTears> I stay off pain melds crept lotsa Motrin
[00:15:37] <North> are you bidding farewell to tamazapam because side effects?
[00:16:09] <BansheeTears> Yea , and I miss dream walking, and dream play
[00:16:16] * North nods
[00:16:39] <BansheeTears> Also hate the idea of begging for my needs every month
[00:17:02] <North> salt in the wound
[00:17:09] <BansheeTears> I can do more using mental training and compartmentalizations
[00:17:25] <BansheeTears> But gotta get this out of my system
[00:17:29] <BansheeTears> Yup
[00:17:40] <North> chamomile is excellent for that, apparently
[00:17:56] <BansheeTears> Being at the mercy of big pharma ,no Bueno
[00:18:36] <BansheeTears> Right now I'm combining hops, chamomile, lemon balm and passionflower
[00:18:55] <BansheeTears> With a valerian tab in the early evening
[00:19:05] <North> solid plan
[00:19:38] <BansheeTears> Day 2 and I don't feel as fluish
[00:19:46] <North> although bear in mind that valerian's effects begin to reverse after a few weeks
[00:20:01] <BansheeTears> Yupp
[00:20:09] <BansheeTears> Switching to kava then
[00:20:15] * Hrafnbjorn peeks in
[00:20:27] <BansheeTears> Bounce between till I get a more normal pattern
[00:20:28] <North> a sound strategy
[00:20:34] <BansheeTears> Her afnbjorn: !!
[00:20:51] <BansheeTears> Hrafnbjorn:  :)

[00:23:24] <BansheeTears> Yup
[00:23:59] <Hrafnbjorn> I never fully quit my job, just not been working, and looking for another.  Now I only go work when I need some $$
[00:24:12] <BansheeTears> That sounds optimal

[00:25:19] <BansheeTears> Everyone is getting cuts because the snowbirds are leaving
[00:25:43] <BansheeTears> Somewhere less hot I hope
[00:25:56] <Hrafnbjorn> there are while towns up in mountains here that shut down for summer when the ski parks close
[00:26:02] <BansheeTears> And with a better community
[00:26:04] <Hrafnbjorn> *whole
[00:26:32] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah... I could handle heat if I had a better community... I would just whine about it a lot
[00:26:35] <BansheeTears> Our town practically shuts down
[00:26:39] <BansheeTears> Brb

[06:17:06] <CantSirDraggin> bacardi says i cannot contribute safely any further
[06:19:57] <Zool> anyways, do you agree with me that male characters in video games are hyper sexualised, as well as giving you men and teens, an un realistic idea of what a man should look like?
[06:20:25] <MissSugar> no
[06:20:31] <MissSugar> and what are you talking about
[06:20:39] <StormWatcher> Men and women 
[06:20:43] <MissSugar> and please tell me your kidding
[06:20:44] <Zool> Sexism in video games...
[06:20:46] <MissSugar> because if not
[06:20:47] <Mim> sounds like he's projecting his insecurities again. 
[06:20:55] <MissSugar> wow just wow
[06:21:02] <StormWatcher> Men always have to be tough and strong 
[06:21:04] <MissSugar> oh look i have a biscuit with jam
[06:21:27] <StormWatcher> Women are always big... well you know and need to be saved
[06:21:49] <MissSugar> its strawberry
[06:21:50] <StormWatcher> We have taught men its not okay to be sensitve
[06:21:58] <Zool> but tough strong women in games, are under attack, for being unrealistic. like Tracer from Overwatch
[06:22:07] <Mim> I'm jealous, I'd like some of that action, MissS
[06:22:12] <MissSugar> its smuckers
[06:22:19] <Mim> MissS, did I tell you about Rene's shop?
[06:22:23] <MissSugar> nooooooooo
[06:22:27] <MissSugar> what is in that shop
[06:22:51] <Mim> She's doing Hemp stuff, but it's mixed with Rasta, Hoodoo, voodoo and santeria

[06:23:28] <Mim> er Obeah
[06:23:37] <MissSugar> the little information there is
[06:23:49] <MissSugar> unfortunately Obea is the only one that is really illegal
[06:23:54] <MissSugar> like super illegal
[06:24:18] <MissSugar> Vodou in haiti is like eh its there and it makes people happy

[06:25:57] <Mim> which I never know how to spell
[06:25:59] <MissSugar> its super duper illegal
[06:26:11] <Mim> they're really scared of obeah here
[06:26:23] <MissSugar> to my knowledge they still burn people who get charged with witchcraft
[06:26:29] <MissSugar> to quote me on that 
[06:26:29] <Hodge> Darn.
[06:26:52] <MissSugar> but yeah there isnt a lot of information on it because of its standing
[06:26:58] <Mim> it's likely
[06:27:15] <MissSugar> which is a bummer because those religions that fall under ATR are so interesting and beautiful
[06:27:55] <Mim> They definitely kill people charged with witchcraft in Africa still
[06:28:01] <MissSugar> oh yeah
[06:28:06] <MissSugar> they will stone you to death there
[06:28:24] <Zool> Goodnight Mim <3

[06:31:24] <MissSugar> this is true
[06:31:27] <Mim> sanguomas
[06:31:40] <Mim> we would be called shamans (to save our asses)
[06:32:01] <MissSugar> yeah i would do anything to avoid a stoning
[06:32:24] <Mim> it's been a real possibility that I would move there
[06:32:35] <Mim> but not lately 
[06:32:42] <Mim> althought, my uni base is there
[06:32:43] <MissSugar> its beautiful i wouldnt mind living there

[06:32:58] <Mim> and everyone says I must must go
[06:33:04] <Mim> for a visit
[06:33:26] <Mim> I'll wait until they get a new president in south africa though
[06:33:41] <MissSugar> LOL we should send trump over there
[06:33:48] <MissSugar> he would make the perfect dictator

[06:33:51] <Mim> they have Zuma tho
[06:34:01] <Mim> oh
[06:34:04] <MissSugar> they could be dictator buddies

[06:35:53] <MissSugar> its not like they can do anything when they are president anyway
[06:35:57] <MissSugar> might as well vote in a cat

[06:36:29] <MissSugar> so yeah Mittens 2016
[06:36:57] <MissSugar> he is going to sign in a fresh kitty litter law that i am totally behind
[06:37:09] <SpiritSong> least the most corrution mittons will bring is the great catfood shortage of the 21st century..mittons will hoard it
[06:37:12] <Mim> LOL!!!
[06:38:11] <MissSugar> Mittens is not corrupt its a ploy by the liberal media!!!

[06:46:11] <MissSugar> i liked mittens so much i made a campaign poster
[06:46:13] <Hrafnbjorn> wow, that would be a bit freaky
[06:46:40] <Hodge> You should visit here Minty. We've got lots of spiders.

[06:47:02] <Centauri> Tartantulas and tumbleweeds here
[06:47:10] <Hodge> I've heard of them before Mim. Didn't know what they were called tho.
[06:47:20] <MissSugar> no amount of chocolate is going to persuade me to visit
[06:47:40] <MissSugar> unless of course you had german chocolate 
[06:47:47] <MissSugar> then i might make an exception
[06:47:57] <MissSugar> ok i really need to do that tarot video
[06:48:01] <Centauri> <teases MissSugar with chocolate and the safe indoors
[06:48:18] <Hodge> We have chocolate fudge?
[06:48:24] <Hrafnbjorn> what is it with Germans... why do they have to make the best of everything, they should share
[06:48:31] <MissSugar> mmmm german chocolate, my grama use to visit relatives in germany and bring us back bars the size of our arms
[06:48:58] <MissSugar> it doesnt even compare to our gross waxy chocolate
[06:49:03] <Hodge> Darn. I'm a little envious at that.
[06:49:08] <MissSugar> i miss that
[06:49:13] <Mim> I *think* that's what they're called, but not sure
[06:49:14] <MissSugar> it ruined chocoalte for me
[06:49:34] <Mim> I like dove dark chocolates
[06:49:39] <MissSugar> because now i am like ugh why does it leave a film on the roof of my mouth
[06:49:44] <MissSugar> oh yeah because its crap chocolate 
[06:49:47] <Centauri> <likes the HARD STUFF (dark choco)
[06:49:49] <Mim> Hershey's has a puke after taste
[06:49:49] <MissSugar> like all the chocolate in the USA
[06:50:05] <MissSugar> because they use palm oil instead of cocoa butter
[06:50:12] <Mim> oh
[06:50:13] <MissSugar> because its cheaper
[06:50:21] <Mim> it's just gross
[06:50:24] <MissSugar> it really is
[06:50:33] <MissSugar> and the majority of our chocolate is made that way
[06:50:53] <Centauri> heh
[06:51:02] <MissSugar> thats why its waxy and leaves that film on the roof of your mouth
[06:51:11] <MissSugar> on the other hand we do moonshine really well
[06:51:26] <Hodge> Oh my god. That's US chocolate that tastes so bad? I never knew.
[06:51:37] <MissSugar> so i guess thats something to be proud of
[06:52:18] <Mim> lol
[06:52:22] <Mim> we used to do oreos
[06:52:26] <Centauri> I studied the chocolate making process, for my game and growing the cocoa, and it seems that raw chocolate sqeezes out some 55% or so of cocoa butter then for edible remix in only about 35-45%, along with a few other ingredients
[06:52:28] <Mim> I had lemon oreos the other day 
[06:52:42] <Hodge> Lemon oreos sound nice.
[06:52:43] <MissSugar> oreos use to be amazing
[06:52:51] <Mim> they were DELICIOUS
[06:52:53] <Hodge> Never had moonshine Minty. What exactly is it?
[06:52:57] <MissSugar> when it was real lard and icing sugar, yeah that sounded gross 
[06:53:05] <MissSugar> but it tasted amazing
[06:53:26] <Centauri> Hodge: moonshine is pure ethanol
[06:53:58] <MissSugar> moonshine is a liquor usually made illegally but some older families have begun the proccess of making their moonshine legal because they have been in the family so long they dont want to loose the recipe
[06:54:26] <MissSugar> it is a home made whiskey made from various fruits, corn, or potatoes 
[06:54:32] <Mim> I think I'm going to go to dream land
[06:54:37] <MissSugar> they actually have a whole show on tlc about it
[06:54:42] <MissSugar> its quite facsinating 
[06:54:45] <Mim> Spirit said they wanted to chat me in my dreams
[06:54:47] <MissSugar> night Mim

[06:56:01] <MissSugar> well we picked up one of those families apple pie moonshine today
[06:56:07] <MissSugar> and it is beautiful
[06:56:26] <MissSugar> it is so amazing that for a second i was like this is almost as good as mead
[06:56:47] <Hrafnbjorn> blasphemy!!!
[06:56:52] <Centauri> LOL
[06:56:53] <Hrafnbjorn> lol, kidding
[06:56:55] <MissSugar> I KNOW
[06:57:13] <MissSugar> but it was like this hit of sweet apple, then it had after notes of cinnamon and nutmeg
[06:57:46] <Centauri> My dad once sitilled some 25% raisin brandy my grandfathr had made, and at 192 proof, iot had no flavor or smell, tho one shot felt like 2 to 3 beers
[06:57:58] <MissSugar> i was like we can only have a small shot of this at a time or we will get turnt in a minute
[06:58:28] <MissSugar> and then i look over at my Redi-Cat berry smoothy and think god this is going to be awful
[06:58:54] <MissSugar> it has the consistancy and look of milk but i know and it knows that it is not milk
[06:59:08] <Centauri> I think everclear is the ultimate drink, mix to taste
[06:59:23] <MissSugar> i prefer sake, or mead
[06:59:30] <MissSugar> if i am being totally honest
[07:00:11] <Hrafnbjorn> sake has the worst hangover ever, but it is good
[07:00:18] <MissSugar> oh its like water
[07:00:29] <Centauri> "heh
[07:00:39] <Hrafnbjorn> I used to live close to the Sho Chiku Bai sake brewery in Folsom, CA, and used to go sit in the garden and drink free sake ;)
[07:00:49] <MissSugar> LOL 
[07:00:58] <MissSugar> welp i am jelous 
[07:01:12] <Hrafnbjorn> nothing like a nice Japanese garden
[07:01:19] <Centauri> Drink lots of water sfter binging,, a hangover is mostly de-hydration of the brain, as alchohol - like cofffee is a dieruetic
[07:02:23] <Hrafnbjorn> I have not had any alcohol in a long time now... was April 20... 2 years, or maybe 3 ago
[07:02:32] <Centauri> Mmmm
[07:02:49] <MissSugar> i cant have 3 cups of sake with out having a conversation with the poor waitress at the resturant who just wanted a tip
[07:02:53] <Centauri> my mind wont stop without some kind of chemical alteration
[07:03:05] <MissSugar> and those are thimble sized
[07:03:05] <Centauri> amnd meditation doesnt work as fast or as well
[07:03:08] <Hrafnbjorn> lol, my dog is outside talkng to the coyotes... funny stuff

[07:08:11] <Centauri> lol
[07:08:26] <Centauri> being sick has nothing to do with the ebb and flow of your body

[07:09:39] <Hrafnbjorn> wow, you could smuggle hobbits into the movies in that purse :)
[07:09:42] <Centauri> <cant get excited about a purse, thats why men have pockets and wallets lol
[07:09:45] <MissSugar> then Cotton was like "look at this one" and i knew at that moment he was a redneck, because it was a tassled monstrosity
[07:09:56] <MissSugar> yeah you have pockets
[07:10:08] <MissSugar> we have indents masqurading as pockets
[07:10:12] <MissSugar> fake pockets

[07:21:27] <SpiritSong> what is it like?
[07:21:32] <Centauri> wow! let me know when you've finished! what a turn about of fair play.. making a sheep from wool, instead of wool from sheep
[07:21:36] <MissSugar> you knitted work is amazing Spirit

[07:22:02] <AntleredGirl> It soothes the soul. 
[07:22:05] <MissSugar> that last piece was adorable
[07:22:10] <SpiritSong> it does ^_^
[07:22:16] <SpiritSong> which last peice
[07:22:17] <MissSugar> it stirred my instincts to squeeze it to death
[07:22:18] <SpiritSong> O_O
[07:22:22] <SpiritSong> oooh
[07:22:29] <SpiritSong> thats Hrafnbjorns stag
[07:22:30] <SpiritSong> :D
[07:22:35] <MissSugar> its amazing
[07:22:38] <Hrafnbjorn> woot woot
[07:22:50] <SpiritSong> AntleredGirl that wool is awesome
[07:23:08] <Centauri> Chiaro: work, heaven, doesn not compute, even if someone WANTS to work, as my father once said, "Work is only work, when you'd rther be somewhere else" and given that, the 'choice' of work in heaven would make it a hobby
[07:24:05] <AntleredGirl> SpiritSong: Hufflepuff shawl time!
[07:27:53] <SpiritSong> nice!!!!
[07:29:01] <Chiaro> Heaven does seem awfully boring, though, unless you just can't get enough of harp music
[07:29:13] <Hrafnbjorn> what is a hufflepuff?
[07:29:22] <Centauri> heh
[07:30:01] <Centauri> I rather like the story i was told by  jew: imagine heaven filled with books about God.. if you like learning about god, its heaven, if you dont, its hell
[07:30:45] <AntleredGirl> Hrafnbjorn: I'm knitting for a commissary in a Harry Potter-inspired event. 
[07:30:52] <Hrafnbjorn> ah ok
[07:31:11] <Centauri> not that I susbscribe to the whole heavel and hell thing or even one god, but the story itself was an interesting way of looking at things
[07:31:32] <Hrafnbjorn> I am willing to bet that if we enter some of the afterlifes, in doing so we shed some of our life-fetters, so who knows what we would or wouldnt like once we shed those
[07:32:24] <Hrafnbjorn> IMO, the only one that sounds appealing to me is Hel
[07:32:26] <Centauri> no way of knowing, to be sure, I dont think we would pass on in this form or thought patterns at all, as such, I dont belive in a sould in a traditional sense at all
[07:33:43] <Hrafnbjorn> I feel that the soul is many things, including, but not limited to the traditional soul paradigm

[08:04:11] <MissSugar> uploading it now
[08:04:25] <MissSugar> and i technically did it on friday so weeeee
[08:04:41] <MCMLXV> you have a youtube channel MissSugar?
[08:04:50] <MissSugar> i dooooo
[08:04:53] <MCMLXV> :D
[08:04:59] <Hrafnbjorn> Im still struggling with how to make some vids
[08:05:10] <MissSugar> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_0o-fMqTuCIL2wsAAlVl6w
[08:05:24] <MissSugar> i talk about tarot and voodoo
[08:05:24] <MCMLXV> you mind if I put a link to it on the web site (when I get it working)?
[08:05:33] <MissSugar> and sometimes do a guided meditation
[08:05:38] <MissSugar> sure i would love that
[08:05:48] <MissSugar> i need to do one on going to the upper worlds
[08:07:06] <Hrafnbjorn> I was gonna do some about runes, but hung up on how to do one for carving the staves, cause it would require changes in camera angle, and Im unsure how to edit it all together
[08:07:13] <MCMLXV> I'll work on it..... I'll get the link from you when I get something worked out
[08:07:51] <MCMLXV> same to you hraf.... you mind if I link to your channel?
[08:08:00] <MissSugar> what i would do is record the same footage from different angles and then do a voice over in audacity about what you are doing
[08:08:14] <Hrafnbjorn> I dont mind at all, I dont have anything posted at the moment though
[08:09:01] <MissSugar> then edit that footage in windows movie maker
[08:09:13] <Hrafnbjorn> I wonder if any of the video editors I have would let me overlay the voice... my laptop is almost out of memory, so I dunno if I want to instal more stuff
[08:09:38] <MissSugar> yeah windows movie maker will allow you to overlay the voice
[08:09:50] <Hrafnbjorn> ok, good
[08:09:58] <MCMLXV> audacity has a pretty small footprint
[08:10:05] <Hrafnbjorn> now I just need the motivation to get it done, lol
[08:10:17] <MissSugar> LOL
[08:10:22] <MissSugar> you will also need LAME
[08:10:30] <MissSugar> to export the audio to mp4
[08:10:38] <Hrafnbjorn> I have plenty of Lame, lol
[08:10:42] <MCMLXV> lol
[08:11:02] <MCMLXV> lame is the mp3/mp4 encoder
[08:11:19] <Hrafnbjorn> I see
[08:11:28] <SpiritSong> MCMLXV!
[08:11:54] <MCMLXV> but win movie maker also will recognise wav, yes?
[08:12:01] <MCMLXV> spirit!
[08:12:04] <MCMLXV> :D
[08:12:08] <MissSugar> uhhhh i dont knowwwwwwwww
[08:12:20] <SpiritSong> hugs :)
[08:12:27] <MCMLXV> wav is windows native...... so I assume it so
[08:12:32] <SpiritSong> i think it does yeah
[08:12:44] <SpiritSong> i had wav files when i used to record to youtube
[08:12:50] <MCMLXV> nods
[08:12:59] <MissSugar> cool
[08:13:05] <MissSugar> so you might not need LAME
[08:14:34] <MCMLXV> mp3/4 is compressed, less space required.... wav is uncompressed, faster, but larger files
[08:16:47] <SpiritSong> nods]
[08:16:53] <MCMLXV> I tinker around a bit with audacity from time to time
[08:17:33] <MCMLXV> did some audio editing back in my modding days
[08:18:03] <Hrafnbjorn> I am fairly ignorant to most computer programs... I have used the art programs a lot, but never used the video, or audio stuff
[08:18:18] <MissSugar> they are pretty user friendly
[08:18:41] <MCMLXV> I'm pretty fluent in audacity, if you have any questions
[08:18:53] <MCMLXV> yeah
[08:19:06] <MCMLXV> audacity is very user friendly
[08:19:32] <MCMLXV> simple program, does one thing, and does it well
[08:19:33] <Hrafnbjorn> going to get it now
[08:20:34] <Hrafnbjorn> do I need the Lame plug-in for it as well?
[08:20:44] <MCMLXV> get it
[08:20:46] <MCMLXV> nods
[08:21:09] <Hrafnbjorn> ok
[08:22:48] <MCMLXV> record a couple short sound bites to practice on... get the feel of the program with
[08:22:59] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[08:23:15] <MCMLXV> dont try encoding a large file without knowing what youre doing

[08:26:04] <Hrafnbjorn> I dont think it is downloading LAME correctly
[08:26:13] <MCMLXV> ?
[08:26:30] <Hrafnbjorn> nope, it downloaded it as unknown filetype
[08:26:39] <MCMLXV> rar?
[08:26:39] <Hrafnbjorn> gonna have to try the zip file I guess
[08:27:19] <MCMLXV> the manual install is pretty simple
[08:27:21] <Hrafnbjorn> nope zip file is same way
[08:27:28] <MCMLXV> :(
[08:27:38] <MCMLXV> lemme find a link
[08:27:40] <Hrafnbjorn> I installed Audacity, but the LAME file wont download correctly
[08:28:10] <MissSugar> weird
[08:28:17] <MissSugar> you shouldnt have to do anything
[08:29:11] <MCMLXV> is this the link you used? >>> http://lame.buanzo.org/#lamewindl
[08:31:16] <Hrafnbjorn> yep... I just got it to work
[08:31:22] <MCMLXV> \o/
[08:31:26] <Hrafnbjorn> so, I need to use it to export as mp3?
[08:31:34] <MCMLXV> yeah
[08:31:47] <Hrafnbjorn> ok, good, it all worked then :) thanks a bunch
[08:32:02] <MCMLXV> there are some settings to tweak, thus practicing on small audio files
[08:33:19] <MCMLXV> and smething to note... the human ear cant notice a difference abouve 124kb bit rate
[08:33:47] <MCMLXV> I think cd quality is 198?
[08:34:08] <Hrafnbjorn> ok
[08:34:08] <MCMLXV> but the human ear only hears up to 124.... (?)
[08:34:40] <MCMLXV> so the added file size is a waste
[08:34:48] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[08:35:12] <Hrafnbjorn> ok, I should have all the programs I need to start experimening then
[08:35:21] <MCMLXV> :)
[08:35:42] <Hrafnbjorn> still have that motivation wall though, lol
[08:35:58] <MCMLXV> the story of my life
[08:36:08] * MCMLXV nods
[08:36:48] <Hrafnbjorn> we are supposed to have nice weather all next week, so maybe I will sit outside in the sun and play with videos and such
[08:37:49] <MCMLXV> we got a hellish storm today here
[08:38:03] <Hrafnbjorn> I told Widders I would do some videos for jo staff too, but I dont think I can do those without someone helping me in the vids
[08:38:13] <MCMLXV> wind, heavy prolonged rain and some hail
[08:38:29] <Hrafnbjorn> hail is scary sometimes
[08:38:30] <MCMLXV> she may help
[08:38:55] <MCMLXV> yeah, hail usually accompanies tornadoes
[08:39:03] <MCMLXV> updrafts
[08:39:10] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[08:39:43] <MissSugar> i cant wait to see your videos
[08:39:58] <MCMLXV> when I was driving, when I got in to hail, I usually stopped asap
[08:40:45] <Hrafnbjorn> one of the towns close by got so much hail one day that they had to bring some snowplows down outa the mountains to clear streets
[08:40:59] <MCMLXV> damn
[08:41:22] <Hrafnbjorn> we dont usualy get a lot of hail here though, so that was not typical at all
[08:42:01] <MCMLXV> the hail we got today was dime sized.... too small to do damage, but really loud inside the van

[08:56:43] <Hrafnbjorn> I picked some cotton when I was in Arkansas, gave me new appreciation for what cotton pickers went through before the machines... its evil to pick
[08:57:11] <MissSugar> Cotton he is my own personal redneck
[08:57:17] <DawnBatGuano> Ah
[08:57:32] <DawnBatGuano> do you have a manly alter-ego though? :P
[08:58:04] <MCMLXV> Ian Astbury.... my man lust >>>> https://youtu.be/8g6h1vI4Xv0
[08:58:23] <MissSugar> the cult!!!!
[08:58:35] <MissSugar> god he is good looking
[08:58:52] <DawnBatGuano> well
[08:58:55] <DawnBatGuano> he WAS androgynous
[08:58:58] <DawnBatGuano> now he's manly
[08:59:11] <Hrafnbjorn> what do9es that have to do with it?
[08:59:14] <Hrafnbjorn> *does
[08:59:18] <MissSugar> before autotune
[08:59:32] <MissSugar> when you had a voice it was spectacular 
[08:59:35] <DawnBatGuano> Hrafnbjorn: I do not understand
[08:59:39] <MCMLXV> if I could be anyone (ANYONE) else in this world, it would be Ian
[09:00:00] <DawnBatGuano> WOAH
[09:00:02] <MissSugar> i think you mean "the cure" Dawn
[09:00:07] <DawnBatGuano> what happened to Pete Burns o-o
[09:00:15] <DawnBatGuano> MissSugar: I'm lost really.
[09:00:53] <MissSugar> he was in dead or alive
[09:00:56] <MissSugar> not the cult
[09:01:11] <DawnBatGuano> I know that.
[09:01:18] <MissSugar> then what are you talking about
[09:01:36] <DawnBatGuano> I was just goggling Pete Burns cause of Ian Astbury
[09:01:48] <MissSugar> ok
[09:01:53] <MissSugar> why
[09:02:07] <DawnBatGuano> 80's Ian Astbury made me kind of think of Pete Burns
[09:02:23] <MissSugar> ok that makes sense
[09:02:43] <DawnBatGuano> They both were very androgynous. Kind of like a few in the 80's
[09:02:45] <MissSugar> now i am going to impart some wisdom my mother imparted on me, dont start your sentances in the middle of your thoughts 
[09:02:49] <MCMLXV> I saw the cult live twice... "love" and "electric" tours.... both shows were awesome
[09:03:05] <DawnBatGuano> MissSugar: My brain isn't functioning right now xD\
[09:03:16] <MissSugar> fair enough
[09:03:28] <DawnBatGuano> I don't have one
[09:03:53] <MissSugar> well thats not true, if it was you would be drooling in a wheel chair right now
[09:04:04] <DawnBatGuano> maybe I am communicating in spirit
[09:04:32] <MCMLXV> one show, dunno which, Ian pointed right at me..... dunno if he was pointing at me or the topless chick behind me tho
[09:04:47] <DawnBatGuano> why not both?
[09:04:53] <MCMLXV> possible
[09:05:38] <DawnBatGuano> or maybe the gost behind the topless girl
[09:06:14] <Hrafnbjorn> maybe he was tryin to help ya out, saying "look behind you!"
[09:06:20] <DawnBatGuano> :P
[09:06:20] <MCMLXV> ^^^
[09:06:34] <MCMLXV> I did
[09:07:37] <DawnBatGuano> I wish my fiancee was an alien
[09:08:30] <Hrafnbjorn> until a little alien pops out your chest
[09:08:34] <MissSugar> uhhg it started with the cult and now i am listening to L&
[09:08:38] <MissSugar> *L7
[09:08:50] <DawnBatGuano> Hrafnbjorn: Trueee
[09:09:15] <MissSugar> oh and Wendy O Williams
[09:09:49] <DawnBatGuano> gack
[09:10:00] <DawnBatGuano> Andromeda to Sol System is like using dial-up :P
[09:10:41] <Hrafnbjorn> isnt Andromeda a whole galaxy?
[09:10:54] <DawnBatGuano> yes
[09:11:05] <DawnBatGuano> If I used my specifics it'd get confusing
[09:11:37] <DawnBatGuano> I'm like on the Far Side in the Inner Systems :3
[09:11:40] <Hrafnbjorn> so Sol to where in Andromeda?
[09:11:57] <Hrafnbjorn> otherwise known as left field?
[09:12:12] <DawnBatGuano> well Anok space is in the Inner Systems within the Far Side...so probs
[09:12:49] * DawnBatGuano is always watching
[09:12:57] <Hrafnbjorn> oh,nevermind, I thought we were talking about real stuff... gotta give us a clue when ya switch from real stuff to fiction so we are on same page
[09:13:13] <DawnBatGuano> my bad xD
[09:13:47] <DawnBatGuano> I thought it'd show with the whole Andromeda to Sol + Dial Up
[09:14:01] <DawnBatGuano> Anywho! Did you know scientists predict the merging of Andromeda and Milky Way?
[09:14:39] <Hrafnbjorn> ok
[09:14:47] <DawnBatGuano> It's kind of a spooky thought
[09:15:01] <DawnBatGuano> They're close enough at this point the gravity and dark matter is pulling them together
[09:15:16] <Hrafnbjorn> who knows if Earth will even still be a loving planet by then
[09:15:22] <DawnBatGuano> Truth
[09:15:26] <Hrafnbjorn> *living
[09:15:30] <DawnBatGuano> or if humans willeven exist
[09:16:06] <DawnBatGuano> also
[09:16:12] <DawnBatGuano> this song : Son of a Preacher Man - Tom Goss <3
[09:18:28] <DawnBatGuano> so what's all up tah
[09:19:01] <Hrafnbjorn> listening to some music, tryin to get sleepy
[09:19:22] <DawnBatGuano> I was listening
[09:19:30] <DawnBatGuano> and then the song took a sudden turn
[09:20:09] <DawnBatGuano> now listening to an Indie Song
[09:20:38] * DawnBatGuano sighs
[09:21:01] <DawnBatGuano> And now I am trying to keep calm
[09:21:40] <Hrafnbjorn> calm likes to be free, if you try to keep it, it will just hide :)
[09:21:52] <DawnBatGuano> I'm kind of having an empathic overload
[09:23:51] <Hrafnbjorn> to whom?
[09:23:57] <DawnBatGuano> No clue
[09:24:00] <MissSugar> welp time for me to go to bed
[09:24:02] <MissSugar> gnight
[09:24:06] <DawnBatGuano> Sometimes when I listen to music I have an overload
[09:24:07] *** Quits: MissSugar (MissSugar@sorcery-ue9hlh.customer.broadstripe.net) (Quit: Sugah out!)
[09:24:11] <Hrafnbjorn> sleep well miss
[09:24:13] <Hrafnbjorn> oops too slow
[09:24:40] <Hrafnbjorn> that sounds like something other than empathy to me
[09:24:47] <DawnBatGuano> how
[09:24:52] <DawnBatGuano> just curio
[09:25:22] <DawnBatGuano> Mnemonic Empathy maybe?
[09:25:31] <Hrafnbjorn> if the music is doing it, Id think it more likely to be sensory overload
[09:25:55] <DawnBatGuano> I was mostly thinking due to the nature of the music it relates to the past
[09:26:16] <Hrafnbjorn> you mean takes you back to past emotions?
[09:26:29] <DawnBatGuano> yeah
[09:26:33] <DawnBatGuano> and ones I need/want
[09:28:12] <Hrafnbjorn> that would be nostolgia
[09:28:27] <DawnBatGuano> I honestly don't know
[09:28:28] <Hrafnbjorn> doesnt look spelled right
[09:29:06] <DawnBatGuano> itisn't
[09:29:18] <Hrafnbjorn> I have nostolgia triggers... the smell of sweaty feet, the smell of sandalwood incnse, etc...

[09:30:16] <DawnBatGuano> Santa Clown
[09:31:44] <DawnBatGuano> wow
[09:31:48] <DawnBatGuano> what a name : Hafth√≥r J√∫l√≠us Bj√∂rnsson
[09:32:11] <Hrafnbjorn> that didnt come across coherent.. its just random characters
[09:32:34] <DawnBatGuano> Hrafnbjorn: Hafthor Julius Bjornsson
[09:32:43] <Hrafnbjorn> ah ok
[09:32:53] <DawnBatGuano> he's from GoT
[09:33:18] <Hrafnbjorn> likely many Icelanders with the name too
[09:33:31] <Hrafnbjorn> maybe not all 3 the same, but all 3 are popular
[09:33:33] <DawnBatGuano> raeally?
[09:33:51] <DawnBatGuano> Also
[09:33:54] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, I only know of 1 with the full 3 names
[09:34:00] <DawnBatGuano> Fabio doesn't seem to age
[09:34:07] <Hrafnbjorn> he was one of the World Strongman competators
[09:34:12] <DawnBatGuano> Yep
[09:34:42] <DawnBatGuano> you don't like having long hair right Hrafnbjorn?
[09:34:56] <Hrafnbjorn> I liked it when I did have long hair
[09:35:06] <DawnBatGuano> ah
[09:35:12] <DawnBatGuano> I thought you said ya didn't once
[09:35:14] <Hrafnbjorn> until I started sitting on it
[09:35:18] <DawnBatGuano> :P
[09:35:43] <DawnBatGuano> I want to have a viking pony-mohawk
[09:36:25] <Hrafnbjorn> ya could leave the 'viking' part off.... thats like saying "I want a fireman haircut"
[09:36:31] <DawnBatGuano> oh
[09:36:42] <DawnBatGuano> That's mostly where I see 'em that's why
[09:36:45] <Hrafnbjorn> viking was just a lifestyle/occupation
[09:36:55] <Hrafnbjorn> not a culture
[09:36:58] <DawnBatGuano> Ahhh
[09:37:19] <DawnBatGuano> does that hairstyle even have a name
[09:37:26] <Hrafnbjorn> so, the vast majority were from the Scandinavian region, but not all Scandinavians were vikings
[09:37:32] <DawnBatGuano> Oh
[09:37:57] <Hrafnbjorn> I dunno, we dont know much at all about their hairstyles back then
[09:38:54] <DawnBatGuano> if I do get one
[09:38:57] <DawnBatGuano> Braids or ney
[09:39:10] <Hrafnbjorn> they are described as keeping their hair long, and having fancy braids... we could also assume that they did have intricate hairstyles cause it was a very vane culture, and we find lots and lots of hair care products from back then... like combs and such
[09:39:27] <DawnBatGuano> Did they have shampoo? :P
[09:39:32] <Hrafnbjorn> yes
[09:39:42] <Hrafnbjorn> lard mixed with herbs
[09:39:46] <DawnBatGuano> ew
[09:39:56] <DawnBatGuano> sounds greasy
[09:40:44] <DawnBatGuano> wait
[09:40:44] <Hrafnbjorn> dunno what type of lard though
[09:40:55] <DawnBatGuano> were there mortal shapeshifters in Scandinavian folklore
[09:41:03] <Hrafnbjorn> yep
[09:41:32] <DawnBatGuano> besides them Berserkers
[09:41:40] <Hrafnbjorn> berserks and ulfhednar were said to shapeshift, and several of the heroic figures shapeshifted
[09:41:52] <Hrafnbjorn> have you watched the Vikings tv show
[09:41:53] <Hrafnbjorn> ?
[09:42:01] <DawnBatGuano> I haven't
[09:42:08] <DawnBatGuano> also Ulfhednar
[09:42:11] <DawnBatGuano> ?
[09:42:25] <Hrafnbjorn> ok, cause one of the characters in it was a shapeshifter too
[09:42:40] <DawnBatGuano> oooh
[09:42:45] <DawnBatGuano> I've heard it isn't exactly accurate
[09:43:09] <Hrafnbjorn> ulfhednar were a type of berserk, berserks changed to bears, ulfhednar changed to wolves
[09:43:15] <DawnBatGuano> Ooooh
[09:43:42] <Hrafnbjorn> it cant be made accurate cause its several different stories made into 1
[09:44:04] <DawnBatGuano> oh
[09:44:09] <Hrafnbjorn> it is pretty accurate for its type of show though
[09:44:42] <Hrafnbjorn> there are some little things, like they use the term Earl instead of Jarl... 
[09:44:53] <DawnBatGuano> Ahhh
[09:45:02] <DawnBatGuano> wasn't earl more Celtic or
[09:45:20] <Hrafnbjorn> no Earl is Saxon English, Jarl is Scandinavian
[09:45:33] <DawnBatGuano> Ah
[09:45:40] <DawnBatGuano> I should restart my pc soon btw
[09:45:51] <DawnBatGuano> oh
[09:46:01] <DawnBatGuano> Michael Fassbender as Macbeth o-o
[09:46:13] <Hrafnbjorn> the Celts and Germanics did have 1 similar social position, the Druid/Drott
[09:46:23] <DawnBatGuano> Ooooh
[09:47:15] <Hrafnbjorn> the only difference is that Druid is also a verb meaning to walk or run over distance, which shows that the druid occupied the same social role, but in a wandering form, whereas the Germanic drott was more sedimentry
[09:47:36] <DawnBatGuano> Interesting :D
[09:48:10] <Hrafnbjorn> druid was not entirely how we use it today, some were holy men, some were not, and at some times the eastern Celts called themselves druid
[09:48:35] <DawnBatGuano> weren't they mostly just lore keepers?
[09:48:59] <Hrafnbjorn> they were lore keepers, but also the overseers of religious rituals
[09:49:35] <DawnBatGuano> Ahhhh
[09:50:03] <DawnBatGuano> I've heard tell of a Norse ceremony involving thor and goats blood?
[09:50:05] <Hrafnbjorn> there was a misconception a little while after the Celtic culture went extinct that the Irish were Celts, so the Irish holy men started being called druid... not only is Irish culture not Celtic, their holy men were different
[09:50:38] <DawnBatGuano> so what was Celt
[09:50:46] <Hrafnbjorn> goat is sacred to Thor, however its safe to assume thats a modern ritual
[09:50:59] <DawnBatGuano> Yeah
[09:51:06] <DawnBatGuano> mom's ex boyfriend spoke of it
[09:51:28] <Hrafnbjorn> Celts were a language group from continental Europe, and some were puxhed up intio the isles by the Romans, but not enough to have lasting impact on culture
[09:52:25] <DawnBatGuano> ohhhh
[09:52:48] <Hrafnbjorn> Heathens were known to sprinkle blood to sacrifice people or objects, but there was also implication that once the blood washed off the sacrifice was over
[09:53:20] <Hrafnbjorn> so if you were sacrificed with blood, it only lasted as long as the blood was still on your skin
[09:53:32] <Hrafnbjorn> once washed off you go back to your profane self
[09:53:34] <DawnBatGuano> AHhhh

[17:30:24] <North> I have a question
[17:30:53] <Darkness> ask away
[17:31:02] <North> (to Hraf)
[17:31:10] <Hrafnbjorn> ?
[17:31:24] <North> did you leave the room last night because a handful of people were decorated with + symbols?
[17:31:41] <Hrafnbjorn> no, not exactly
[17:31:51] <North> elaborate, if you will
[17:33:23] <Hrafnbjorn> I was frustrated in general.  There was someone that was bordering on trolling, so I voiced the other folk that were active, and Mim voiced the one that was starting to troll.  So I figured I should vacate until I wasnt feeling so frustrated.  She ended up banning him.
[17:33:40] <North> ah, k
[17:33:58] <North> <-- hadn't scrolled up far enough, evidently
[17:34:20] <Hrafnbjorn> she didnt know why I was voicing the folk though, so it wasnt Mim's doing
[17:37:31] <North> love that girl
[17:37:39] * North 's eyes scintillate over his ricey lunch
[17:38:06] <Hrafnbjorn> rice is so yum

[17:40:28] <Darkness> my chat screen is black now
[17:40:28] <Hrafnbjorn> folk are trying to push the rice industry out of California, along with the cattle industry.
[17:40:48] <North> why rice?
[17:41:03] <North> cattle I can sort of understand
[17:41:30] <Hrafnbjorn> cause both use way way too much water... and the rice is also bad for mosquitos, and we are having a west nile disease problem, which is spread by mosquitos
[17:41:44] <North> ahhh
[17:41:53] <North> a valid concern
[17:42:51] <Hrafnbjorn> I dont much care about the cattle industry, thats better left for the plains regions, but the rice will be missed
[17:43:01] <Darkness> would that really stop west nile thoe? i mean once its already there isn't it like permanent?
[17:43:45] <Hrafnbjorn> it wont stop it completely, no, but it would reduce the chances of getting it
[17:44:57] <Hrafnbjorn> the amount of mosquito here during summer isnt natural.  While we still dont get as many as other places, summer here isnt supportive of them, but the rice fields make it so they can tolerate the summer better, so it let the population get out of natural coontrol

[17:45:59] <Hrafnbjorn> they are the #1 killer of humans within the animal world

[18:23:28] <Hrafnbjorn> we dont have to keep the grass cut this time of year, but it has to be cut once it turns yelllow in late spring due to fire threat
[18:23:53] <Hrafnbjorn> would be nice if it stayed green all year

[21:30:03] <H-> yeah I make stuff myself too but not books :p
[21:30:16] <Iona> H-, what kind of useful things are you looking for?
[21:30:37] <H-> books mostly, the spiritual kind
[21:30:49] *** Quits: ronin (Mibbit@sorcery-m2ferv.lib.me.us) (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[21:30:49] <H-> I found solomons key once.. put it away, that's not for me
[21:30:54] <Hrafnbjorn> focused on what sort of spiritual things?
[21:31:40] <H-> understanding the matter better to be honest, perhaps some summoning / casting out / shielding etc
[21:32:22] <H-> I can make the items to ward of the less pleasant ones myself. I don't know how, I just can
[21:33:20] <Hrafnbjorn> I dunno about those topics to be honest
[21:33:41] <H-> yeah it's hard to find any good books about it
[21:34:01] <Iona> H-...  recipes and religious rituals kind of miss the truth of those matters, they just approach it from one perspective...  
[21:34:37] <H-> oh yeah all too true Iona
[21:34:45] <Hrafnbjorn> I dont summon, so Id have no clue which books are good, or not
[21:35:14] <H-> well summon.. was the best way to put it :D I don't summon either but it's the closest I get to discribing it
[21:35:28] <H-> English not being my native tongue and all
[21:35:30] <Iona> so... since there's multiple perspectives which seem to be "valid" (i.e. they may "work"), what do you think the way to do things is?
[21:35:40] <H-> explore
[21:35:45] <Iona> ^ bingo.
[21:35:52] <H-> find as much info as possible and then find out things that work for me
[21:35:53] <Iona> There's no wrong way, as long as you do so respectfully.
[21:36:21] <Hrafnbjorn> the closest I come is inviting ancestors to be present (or on rare occasions deity, but thats very rare)
[21:36:27] <H-> yeah I learned to be respectfull the hard way ;)
[21:37:03] <H-> Hrafnbjorn: yeah I'm looking for something like that, but more like taking a glimpse.. if that makes any sense
[21:37:12] <Iona> It's worth mentioning that if you buy into a duality, the opposite duality will also manifest...
[21:37:20] <Iona> i.e. angels + demons...
[21:37:35] <H-> hence the shielding ;)
[21:37:52] <H-> although I really don't like calling it angels or demons :P it's merely a choice
[21:38:13] <Iona> or just avoid those situations altogether...  working with things which are smaller in influence perhaps?
[21:38:49] <H-> can't avoid the situations to be honest, I tried
[21:39:05] <Hrafnbjorn> you could adjust the goal, there are some good books regarding trance work that may help... Trance-portation by Diana Paxson is a good book for trance work.  She is Heathen, but she writes for a general pagan audiance
[21:39:36] <Iona> hmmmm...
[21:39:53] <H-> thanks Hrafnbjorn :)
[21:40:07] <Hrafnbjorn> I have found, personaly, that meeting on neutral ground, OR going to the 'other' is often better way because its less demanding to the other
[21:40:17] <Iona> H-, "shielding" can mean multiple things - the general gist of it is separation so as to be less influenced...
[21:40:18] <Hrafnbjorn> so trance work works great in that context
[21:41:09] <H-> Iona: I seem to be some kind of bloody magnet. I do seperation as much as possible, sometimes that's  not enough.. I know how to shield myself but it burns energy like mad.. I get VERY hot doing so btw
[21:41:13] <H-> my surroundings aswell
[21:41:59] <Iona> Then you want shielding which isn't an active behavior, but a latent pattern on top of which you do your active behavior...  
[21:42:15] <Iona> purification ceremonies perhaps...  smudge sticks?  washing?  etc...?
[21:42:49] <H-> hmm.. I found those things not working for me, it's most likely my own mind blocking it
[21:42:59] <Hrafnbjorn> generaly heat created from energy flow is the result of resistance, so it may be worth it to self-reflect to try to discern if, and where you may be having blockages or friction
[21:43:30] <Iona> mindfulness is a great way to be aware of where there's resistance...
[21:43:35] <H-> that's a very good point, I never even thought about it that way
[21:44:05] <H-> although heat from energy flow takes away pain, that comes in usefull
[21:44:06] <Iona> H-, are you familiar with stream-of-consciousness activities?
[21:44:13] <Iona> (that's true!)
[21:44:14] <H-> Iona: nope :O
[21:44:45] <Iona> Ok, H-...  have you ever been asked to write down whatever you're thinking at the moment, even if it's nonsensical?  
[21:44:57] <Iona> for example, right now, for me...  
[21:45:00] <Iona> leg hurts
[21:45:03] <Iona> bad posture
[21:45:07] <Iona> putting leg onto floor
[21:45:14] <Iona> smelling the air
[21:45:15] <H-> yeah I guess my sister falling and badly hurting her ancle triggered something in me a long time ago.. got very hot instantly and took her pain away
[21:45:17] <Iona> (end)
[21:45:25] * Iona smiles...
[21:45:34] <H-> Iona: yeah I see your point
[21:45:43] <H-> this is already helping :) thanks
[21:46:02] <Iona> Observing that stream of consciousness within yourself at any moment...
[21:46:26] <Iona> is a useful thing to do for mindfulness practices...  and that will eventually give you more tools so you can identify what's creating frictions...
[21:47:47] <H-> I'll put my mind to that first then :) thanks :D  about the writing, not really. I tried it with music though
[21:48:02] <Iona> it can be in any context really
[21:48:41] <Iona> for example, from a music perspective...
[21:48:58] <Iona> you can observe what sounds resonate how with you
[21:49:21] <Iona> major chords, minor chords...  the qualities of the instrument(s) and how they make you feel...
[21:49:34] <Iona> the duration (and the spaces between durations)
[21:50:56] <H-> yeah I'm already working on that :)
[21:50:57] <Iona> It is, for lack of another metaphor, like a kind of  "dance of sensation".  The skills you develop in one dance do help to make other "dances of sensations" easier...
[21:51:09] <H-> good point
[21:52:05] <Iona> Also, don't just take my say so...  try it out for yourself...
[21:52:07] <Iona> :)
[21:52:15] <Iona> See if what I say makes sense for you.
[21:52:27] <H-> yeah, I'm just open for anything, but what you're saying makes a lot of sense ;)
[21:52:48] <H-> it's the  * of course.. why did I not think of that before* feeling :o)
[21:53:17] <Iona> You just did.  Give yourself some credit!
[21:53:26] <H-> I will definitly be getting the trans-portation book though :) thanks
[21:54:06] <Hrafnbjorn> its a great book
[21:54:38] <Hrafnbjorn> written by lady that is medieval studies professor at UC Berkley, and one of the co-authors for Mists of Avalon :)
[21:54:52] <H-> it's just too bad there aren't any good stores around here.. even if it were to find someone to talk about it in real life

[22:35:05] <BansheeTears> Jasper's?
[22:35:38] <Hrafnbjorn> I dunno,, they do loook like it, but they were pre-packaged, and it didnt list the type, I just thought they were pretty

[22:36:43] <BansheeTears> Llovely colors tho
[22:37:08] <Hrafnbjorn> thats not so bad, infact it may let ya focus more on artistic use of the wire since ya wouldnt have to plan for the looop for cord/chain

[22:43:09] *** Quits: Spiceboi (brett@sorcery-gs1.asa.93.197.IP) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:43:11] <BansheeTears> Lance and I are working on. Altfaiths
[22:43:32] <BansheeTears> So there will be three sites all with links to this room
[22:43:40] <Hrafnbjorn> ah, so Altfaiths and Witchesgrove are gonna be different now?
[22:43:59] <BansheeTears> Not sure what the plan is
[22:44:06] <Hrafnbjorn> ok
[22:44:26] <BansheeTears> I'm just redoing the Altfaiths Wordpress page to give us something in the meantime
[22:44:39] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[22:45:04] <Hrafnbjorn> folk seem to be missing the site, which I find a bit odd since there wasnt much activity on the forums
[22:45:15] <BansheeTears> Ikr
[22:45:40] <BansheeTears> We're hoping to allow for individual blogs
[22:46:25] <BansheeTears> So you and spirit and me and miss sugar can operate and structure broadcasts and classes and such
[22:46:45] <BansheeTears> Give folks a little nest of their own
[22:46:48] <Hrafnbjorn> that would be nice
[22:47:10] <Hrafnbjorn> anything to get folk to be more expressive IMO
[22:47:20] <BansheeTears> It'll open things up to more diversity
[22:47:25] <BansheeTears> Totally
[22:47:50] <BansheeTears> Lance is taking vacation to work on it
[22:48:01] <BansheeTears> So hopefully it will work out
[22:48:14] <Hrafnbjorn> there are still several folk that have been regulars here for a long time, but I still dont have a clue about their spiritual thoughts, so giving them a place to express that would be nice way to get to know them better
[22:48:26] <BansheeTears> Alternativefaiths and Altfaiths  will
[22:48:33] <BansheeTears> Be connected too
[22:48:52] <BansheeTears> So the Twitter, fab , and Pinterest will all be linked
[22:48:59] <BansheeTears> Fb
[22:49:11] <Hrafnbjorn> nice
[22:49:24] <BansheeTears> Altfaiths
[22:49:33] <Iona> Cool :)
[22:49:35] <BansheeTears> Will forward to alternative faiths
[22:49:57] <BansheeTears> It'll be fun
[22:50:11] <BansheeTears> Hopefully we'll have a gallery set up too
[22:50:24] <BansheeTears> Limited image size tho
[22:50:28] <Iona> May I suggest a backup system?
[22:50:38] <BansheeTears> Die to the magnitude of the library
[22:50:45] <BansheeTears> Due
[22:50:48] <Iona> That way if the database gets deleted again, we won't be SOL?
[22:50:49] <Hrafnbjorn> I wish I knew how to code better, then I may be able to help, but I only know basic html
[22:50:52] <BansheeTears> Please do
[22:51:10] <BansheeTears> We're saving everything as we go
[22:51:45] <Iona> well, the raw stored on MySQL, so any old exporting system will work fine...  you just need a destination...
[22:51:49] <Iona> *raw data
[22:52:09] <Iona> and you'll want mirrors of the WordPress PHP files (and the files they use) too...
[22:52:16] <BansheeTears> Maybe you and lance can chat
[22:52:33] <Hrafnbjorn> that all went right over my head, lol
[22:52:37] <Iona> Maybe...  it should be possible to automate backups to say dropbox
[22:52:54] <BansheeTears> Me too
[22:53:21] <BansheeTears> Lance is doing the site on his computer then uploading changes
[22:53:41] <BansheeTears> But I'll tell him to talk to ya
[22:54:03] <Iona> Ok, thanks.  You're both awesome (but don't let that get to your head!)
[22:54:11] <BansheeTears> Lol!
[22:54:35] <BansheeTears> Thanks  :) but I doubt this is gonna Beas smooth as I hope
[22:54:47] <Iona> Ehh, few things worthwhile are easy...
[22:54:55] <BansheeTears> Truth
[22:55:12] <BansheeTears> The size of the library is confounding
[22:55:17] <Iona> does Lance have a github account?
[22:55:26] <BansheeTears> Not that I know of
[22:55:43] <Iona> It may be helpful for collaboration
[22:56:00] <BansheeTears> What we had on the site... Was about 10%
[22:56:03] <Iona> I can probably help here and there (I have my own full-time projects)
[22:56:13] <BansheeTears> Thanks :)
[22:56:34] <Iona> Thank _you_.
[22:56:44] <BansheeTears> :)
[22:57:03] <BansheeTears> Ok off to go make a wreath
[22:57:12] <BansheeTears> Need sun time
[22:57:28] <BansheeTears> Hugs and love!
[22:58:11] <Hrafnbjorn> be well
