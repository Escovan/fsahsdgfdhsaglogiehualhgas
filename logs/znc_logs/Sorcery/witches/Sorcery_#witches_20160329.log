[01:25:27] <Widdershins> booo!
[01:25:28] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> Two weeks after the party they got into a screaming match. That was when they moved to a new plsce

[01:25:45] <DawnBat> y'all need Fomorians
[01:25:50] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> But it was too small so they moved again. This time with different drunk neighbors 
[01:26:04] <Widdershins> that gets expensive
[01:26:13] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> And one who runs the bar across the street so she'd come home at like 2 am 
[01:26:20] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> Didn't take the.

[01:27:59] <Widdershins> theres a lot of drinking here too
[01:28:16] <Widdershins> summers- people get bored and get drunk
[01:29:01] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> Here it's more social. Everyone gathers at the bar after work and drinks

[01:30:11] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> Sort of
[01:30:39] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> I don't know if there's a law. But a lot of people have a weapon of some sort in each vehicle 
[01:30:48] <Widdershins> not much more disconcerting than a drunk man with a gun and an attitude
[01:31:10] <Keith> indeed... dangerous combination
[01:31:16] <Widdershins> here we carry guns like purses or wallets
[01:31:29] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> I don't have a gun. But I did get a crossbow
[01:31:44] <Widdershins> crossbows <3
[01:31:55] <Keith> no guns on the hip out here

[02:46:05] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> There is a relatively young field called Noetic Science that is based on the idea that the gap between Magick and Science is not only NOT as large as some may think, it's acyually non-existent
[02:46:46] <Mim> I suppose that would often have something to do with the definition of magick
[02:47:07] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> True
[02:47:23] <Mim> as I see it, it's the conscious manipulation of energy
[02:48:11] <Mim> but it could be unconscious too
[02:48:28] <Mim> subconscious
[02:51:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I think all three
[02:52:01] <Mim> so, do you think everyone does magick?
[02:52:44] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Some do it without knowing they are, yes.
[02:53:01] <Mim> do you consider that dangermouse?
[02:54:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It can be, I suppose. But, I suspect that those that do it unknowingly don't really do any serious damage
[02:56:32] * Mim nods
[02:56:49] <Mim> I'm starting to think that humans are inherently good, but sometimes something goes wrong 
[02:57:02] <Mim> most people, for example, don't want to see others suffer 
[02:57:14] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I think that when our Christian friends pray, they do magic and don't realize it.
[02:57:22] <Mim> I completely agree
[02:57:32] <Mim> I've always identified with them on that level
[02:57:44] <Mim> I work with a Chrstian girl
[02:58:02] <Mim> she's nice, I only have to tongue smack her once a week ;) 
[02:59:00] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It's the same principle as when a groupof us, gathered in a circle, gather energy and direct it toward a purpose. The differance is, we are conscious of what we are doing, and that puts more intent behind it.
[02:59:11] <Mim> I think she actually thinks witches fly around on brooms and have green faces ;) 
[02:59:45] <Mim> do you think that having more intent behind the intention makes a spell work more quickly?
[02:59:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Doesn't she know that Modern Witches don't fly brooms??  We use vacuum cleaners.  ;)
[02:59:56] <Mim> I use airplanes
[03:00:05] <Mim> less wind lash
[03:00:13] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It can, but sometimes still takes time. Depends on the spell.
[03:00:20] <Mim> ok
[03:00:30] <Mim> just curious b/c my spells seem to work quickly
[03:00:39] <Mim> then again, it depends on the need for me
[03:01:20] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I think that intent and magnitude are definitely factors
[03:01:38] * Mim nods
[03:01:44] <Mim> do you do a lot of spell work, yourself? 
[03:02:30] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> No, only at ritual.
[03:02:36] <Mim> ok 
[03:02:52] <Mim> so ritual magick?
[03:03:12] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I study magick, though. A Warrior's function is to protect, and I need to understand the thing I protect.
[03:04:10] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I participate in rituals, but let the person conducting it perform the magick. I just aid in helping raise the energy.
[03:04:36] <Mim> oh ok 
[03:04:46] <Mim> does everyone sort of have a role there?
[03:05:07] <Mim> isn't raising energy part of the magick?
[03:06:47] <Mim> brb checking on the chicken
[03:07:39] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, there is usually the priestess or priest conducting the ritual, the 4 quarters, and the Gatekeeper who smudges all who come to the circle
[03:18:49] <Mim> interesting
[03:19:51] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> One of the witches who sometimes conducts ritual is older, and utilizes a classical style.
