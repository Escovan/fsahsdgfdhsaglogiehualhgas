[00:04:17] <North> hmm...
[00:04:27] <North> just remembered that Scott Weiland is dead
[00:04:32] <MissSugar> yeah thats sad
[00:04:36] <North> weird, people being dead
[00:04:38] <MissSugar> he had such a talent
[00:04:39] <North> <-- profound
[00:04:42] <North> aye
[00:04:44] <MissSugar> heroin man its a bitch
[00:04:55] <North> that's what they tell me
[00:07:43] <North> ice cream: yet another rollercoaster
[00:07:50] <North> <-- speaking from recent experience
[00:10:44] <MissSugar> i might make some home made icecream
[00:11:41] <MissSugar> heavy cream, condensed milk, oreos, caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, and then have a sugar overload and die from a diabetic shut down of all my major organs
[00:11:51] <North> lol
[00:11:56] <North> that sounds fantastic
[00:12:05] <MissSugar> doesnt it!?!?
[00:12:08] <MissSugar> im excited
[00:12:12] <North> the first, ingredients-involving part
[00:12:59] * North clarifies, because why not
[00:13:43] <MissSugar> you whip the cream, then add the condensed milk, then add the crushed oreos, then freeze it 
[00:14:00] <MissSugar> then you dump some caramel and chocolate on top and eat
[00:14:10] <North> yumyum
[00:15:11] <North> when ice cream is good, it's GREAT
[00:16:25] <MissSugar> it is

[03:46:43] <DawnBat> got my pc for 150% I think
[03:46:53] <DawnBat> and it's fairly good
[03:47:04] <XCuteWitchX> I never got into gaming. Unless it's a Nintendo DS.

[03:49:39] <Edward> The emulators for nes and snes are pretty good.
[03:50:08] <XCuteWitchX> I might. I'm in the mood for old school mario.
[03:50:10] <Edward> I have to say that my favorite of all the nintendo systems is actually the gameboy.
[03:50:26] <Edward> Between my nes,snes,gamecube-wii, and gameboy emullators
[03:50:28] <XCuteWitchX> Mine too. I HATED the wii
[03:50:31] <Edward> I have the most roms for gameboy
[03:51:32] <XCuteWitchX> I remember picking up an old one at a garage sale that didn't have a back light on it
[03:51:43] <XCuteWitchX> From the 80s I assume
[03:51:58] <Edward> You know, I still have my gameboy... the original gameboy, the bulky gray one with the green screen.
[03:52:03] <Edward> I hear they sell for alot of moneys these days.
[03:53:25] <XCuteWitchX> I'd probably sell it too lol.
[03:53:46] <Edward> Well, I mean.. I dont really need it
[03:53:49] <Edward> I have meh emulator
[03:53:50] <Edward> :P

[03:54:29] <Edward> emulating *
[03:54:55] <Edward> The n64 emulator has got to be the worst of all the nintendo emulators
[03:54:59] <Edward> Its buggy as crap.
[03:55:16] <Edward> Atleast I can play mario and ocarina of time fairly decently..... plus texture packs!
[03:56:27] <XCuteWitchX> I think I tried the GameCube emulator and it was so laggy. Took an hour just to get to the actual game then crashed.
[03:56:37] <XCuteWitchX> Then again my old laptop was junk

[04:06:07] <XCuteWitchX> That's crazy. I do all that as well. Though when I try to meditate, it typically ends in me falling asleep lol.
[04:06:49] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That's not really a bad thing, XCuteWitchX
[04:07:03] <XCuteWitchX> Really? I find it annoying.
[04:07:52] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I almost dozed off during a guided meditation,once. The result was, I felt totally relaxed for the first time in a couple months.
[04:08:58] <XCuteWitchX> I felt that way too. Except I only fell asleep for about 5 minutes and felt like I got a whole nights sleep
[04:09:23] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Meditation is supposed to clear the mind. And if you nod off, that's a sign it works. Especially if you have trouble falling asleep, because your mind WON'T shut up!
[04:09:44] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Then, it definitely worked, XCuteWitchX
[04:11:32] <XCuteWitchX> My mind is so stubborn, I'll worry and work myself up to a point of insomnia and be up most the night, so it definitely did work then.
[04:12:16] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I would say so.
[04:14:57] <Edward> When I meditate, I put some music on and just focus on that and end up miles away.....

[08:50:26] <MissSugar> its a cute little show
[08:50:37] <Leviathan> i dont know it, what is it about?
[08:51:20] <Leviathan> let me google it
[08:52:51] <Leviathan> its from disney
[08:52:55] <Leviathan> disney channel :P
[08:53:01] <Leviathan> it looks funny
[08:53:02] <MissSugar> it sure is
[08:53:33] <Leviathan> MissSugar
[08:53:39] <MissSugar> yes?
[08:54:13] <Leviathan> do you feel identified with a religion or some kind of philosophy?
[08:55:10] <MissSugar> i practice Voodoo
[08:55:31] <MissSugar> yourself?
[08:56:06] <Leviathan> i read a lot
[08:56:18] <Leviathan> maybe that means something
[08:56:30] <MissSugar> what types of things do you find interesting?
[08:57:01] <Leviathan> the last things i've read where about apolonio, the nuctemeron
[08:58:02] <MissSugar> i havent heard of it
[08:58:13] <Leviathan> i think he was a greek philosopher
[08:58:32] <Leviathan> and the nuctemeron is a metaphor
[08:58:57] <Leviathan> the day in the night
[08:59:37] <Leviathan> MissSugar, voodoo has something to do with animal sacrifice?
[08:59:46] <MissSugar> it has that
[08:59:56] <Leviathan> and what you do with the blood?
[09:00:05] <Leviathan> when you sacrifice a creature
[09:00:20] <Leviathan> you use the energy of their souls
[09:00:24] <Leviathan> ?
[09:00:28] <MissSugar> i dont sacrifice animals 
[09:00:40] <Leviathan> voodoo is black magic?
[09:00:47] <Leviathan> dont be angry
[09:00:50] <MissSugar> im not
[09:01:01] <Leviathan> what do you mean by voodoo?
[09:01:01] <MissSugar> it depends on the practitioner
[09:01:30] <Leviathan> its some kind of shamanic witchcraft?
[09:01:34] <MissSugar> Voodoo is a religion that combines African, Native American, European, and other various types of magick
[09:01:48] <MissSugar> it came out of slavery
[09:01:56] <Leviathan> like the umbandism
[09:02:18] <MissSugar> yes
[09:02:31] <Leviathan> do they have magic rituals?
[09:02:34] <Leviathan> im sure they do
[09:02:50] <MissSugar> yes they do, it all revolves around the spirits known as Lwa
[09:03:02] <Leviathan> what is lwa?
[09:03:59] <MissSugar> the Lwa are a group of spirits that work under God, like the saints of Catholicism 
[09:04:38] *** Joins: Leviatan_ (5423@sorcery-98n.d79.2.190.IP)
[09:04:38] <Abraxas> Welcome, Leviatan_. Love is not maximum emotion. Love is maximum commitment.
[09:04:46] <MissSugar> eb 
[09:04:47] <Leviatan_> MissSugar, what is lwa?
[09:04:49] <MissSugar> *wb
[09:04:53] <Leviatan_> thank you
[09:04:59] <MissSugar> the Lwa are a group of spirits that work under God, like the saints of Catholicism 
[09:05:12] <Leviatan_> the spirits of africans and native americans?
[09:05:29] <MissSugar> yeah mostly
[09:05:52] <Leviatan_> and they speak in rare languages?
[09:06:23] <MissSugar> there is a language that is secret only to voodoo initiates, but i dont know it
[09:06:40] <Leviatan_> its like some kind of sumerian?
[09:06:58] <MissSugar> i believe it is a combination of various african languages

[09:07:25] <Leviatan_> i had an experience like that once
[09:07:51] <MissSugar> where you talked to the spirits in their own language?
[09:07:56] <Leviatan_> yes
[09:08:05] <MissSugar> that is very cool
[09:08:11] <Leviatan_> and i didnt understand nothing
[09:08:32] <Leviatan_> it was like sanscrit, aramean
[09:09:00] <MissSugar> thats weird, like they didnt want you to understand what they were saying
[09:09:23] <Leviatan_> a friend told me that it was the language of spiritism
[09:09:57] <Leviatan_> when i saw that i was in a jail
[09:10:04] <MissSugar> thats a bummer
[09:10:12] <Leviatan_> and i've talked with the spirits of the people who died there
[09:10:37] <MissSugar> did they make themselves understood?
[09:10:39] <Leviatan_> it was like i was reading their thoughs
[09:10:50] <Leviatan_> i remember a few words
[09:10:53] <Leviatan_> like
[09:11:22] <Leviatan_> the last words i saw
[09:11:35] <Leviatan_> in fact you picked up a gaaayyll
[09:11:38] <Leviatan_> in god we must trust
[09:11:46] <Leviatan_> they spoke that in english
[09:12:03] <MissSugar> that must have come through
[09:12:19] <Leviatan_> what?
[09:12:25] <MissSugar> like a leak
[09:13:30] <Leviatan_> most of those spirits are of a negative naturality
[09:13:35] <Leviatan_> or they seem to be
[09:13:37] <Leviatan_> like that
[09:13:54] <MissSugar> i wouldnt be surprised considering the place
[09:14:11] <Leviatan_> MissSugar
[09:14:20] <Leviatan_> did you had experiences in the graveyards?
[09:15:07] <MissSugar> the last time i was in a graveyard was like 7 years ago in the middle of the night, I was there to pick up some dirt
[09:15:33] <Leviatan_> did you grab that dirt to make a magic circle
[09:15:33] <Leviatan_> ?
[09:16:15] <MissSugar> no i grabbed the dirt because it can be used in a number of different ways
[09:20:21] <Leviatan_> i think it might have magical properties
[09:20:25] <Leviatan_> graveyard dirt
[09:21:13] <Leviatan_> MissSugar, what energy properties has?
[09:23:28] <MissSugar> its like a "do all"
[09:23:39] <Leviatan_> you can use it in many ways
[09:23:40] <Leviatan_> ?
[09:23:45] <MissSugar> protection, love, curses etc
[09:23:51] <MissSugar> yeah
[09:23:59] <Leviatan_> its said that graveyard dirt is cursed earth
[09:24:27] <MissSugar> yeah there are beliefs like that
[09:24:39] <Keith> i belief that graveyard dirt is blessed
[09:24:41] <Leviatan_> and some people believe that the undeads do exist

[10:17:53] <Iona> Rajoguna: what have you learned about Kali in cross-cultural contexts?
[10:18:11] <Iona> (I don't have solutions for your friend...)
[10:18:56] <Keith> our friend seems fine
[10:18:59] <Keith> your
[10:19:12] <Rajoguna> whatdya mean
[10:19:36] <Rajoguna> I know that people greatly misunderstand her.
[10:19:43] <Iona> yes they do
[10:20:26] <Iona> my meditations taught me a lot...
[10:20:40] <Iona> (enough to get me into trouble too!...)
[10:21:47] <Iona> what aspects are the less-obvious aspects for her?
[10:43:01] <Keith> and the room sleeps
[10:45:12] <Iona> yes it does
[10:45:32] <Keith> Rajoguna probably fell asleeps
[10:45:46] * Iona shrugs... I do that too...
[10:45:50] <Rajoguna> im here
[10:46:00] <Keith> why would anyone sleep?
[10:46:01] <Rajoguna> her apspect of love of course
[10:46:05] <Rajoguna> im here Iona 
[10:46:08] <Keith> i "deeply meditate"
[10:46:13] <Rajoguna> i just was busy on a forum sorry
[10:46:25] <Keith> hehe just buggin ya Rajoguna
[10:46:31] <Iona> Rajoguna: you mean, like Aphrodite-ish love?
[10:46:38] <Rajoguna> though really overall i think probably her demon slaying aspect
[10:46:49] <Rajoguna> even though its ironically also her most common depiction
[10:46:57] <Rajoguna> well its not focused on except by shaktas i guess
[10:47:03] <Rajoguna> No, it's motherly love
[10:47:35] <Iona> hmmm
[10:47:47] <Rajoguna> she isn't a sexual goddess except in shaivite tantra where she is sexual with bhairav.
[10:47:59] <Rajoguna> Left Hand Path Tantra
[10:48:08] * Iona nods...
[10:48:12] <Rajoguna> Bhairava is the fierce aspect of Shiva just as Kali is the fierce aspect of Parvati
[10:48:21] <Rajoguna> or Shakti
[10:48:38] <Rajoguna> Iona have you ever killed anything?
[10:48:54] <Rajoguna> like something that was an invertebre
[10:49:02] <Rajoguna> not an invertebre*
[10:49:14] <Iona> ants, yes...  
[10:49:21] <Rajoguna> bugs dont have spines
[10:49:36] <Rajoguna> ok um have u ever killed a bird/mammal or lizard or something like that
[10:49:46] <Iona> a dog, on accident, turns out some painkillers are toxic...
[10:50:44] <Iona> who would have thought that ibuprofen (smallest size) was deathly toxic to them?...
[10:54:09] <Iona> why do you ask?
[10:55:13] <Rajoguna> i killed a mouse once by dropping a brickon it it, it was in shock after my cat caught it
[10:55:15] <Rajoguna> and bit it
[10:55:30] <Rajoguna> idk why i thought of it
[10:55:44] <Iona> it's life...  death can happen in a myriad of ways...
[10:55:50] <Rajoguna> im on this forum and someone mentioned doing animal sacrifice once (some nordic pagan)
[10:56:04] <Iona> to whom?
[10:56:17] <Iona> I know that Hel accepts pigs...  
[10:56:26] <Rajoguna> i  think they killed a goat.
[10:56:32] <Rajoguna> they did it in a group setting
[10:56:37] <Iona> hmmm

[16:33:20] <Aria> ima drunk pineapple
[16:33:32] <Keith> yay drunk pineapples lol
[16:33:57] <Aria> i got drunk via the astral plane its so weird
[16:34:04] <Aria> its taking quite a while to wear off
[16:34:10] <Aria> havin a hangover
[16:34:13] <Keith> that is odd. never heard of that before lol
[16:34:48] <Aria> ya bt it works
[16:34:54] <Aria> i mean im totally wiped out
[16:34:57] <Keith> good deal :)
[16:35:02] <Keith> go get some sleeps
[16:35:05] <Aria> i already did
[16:35:12] <Aria> but the nap only lasted one hor
[16:35:22] <Aria> body wont let me
[16:35:26] <Keith> ohhhhhh
[16:35:27] <Aria> took paracetemol
[16:35:32] <Keith> you need a hot shower :)
[16:35:34] <Aria> cant believe i actually got drunk via the astral
[16:35:35] <Aria> already did
[16:35:38] <Aria> like 3 hours ago
[16:35:49] <Keith> oh
[16:35:58] <Keith> so yer all rested and ready to go
[16:36:00] <Aria> Keith 
[16:36:05] <Aria> you said youre weather manip stuffs
[16:36:09] <Aria> wait lets tall k about it later
[16:36:15] <Keith> okies dokies
[16:36:16] <Keith>  and yup
[16:36:16] <Aria> when im mnot like this
[16:36:21] <Keith> no worries
[16:36:41] <Aria> well no im not rested i feel tired have a headache and feel wonky any time i get out of bed
[16:37:18] <Keith> perhaps try meditating?? settle yourself out?
[16:37:50] <Aria> but when i was drunk it was fun although at one point they fed me too much red wine so i had to get it removed and then i felt better again and being drunk was fun but now im hungover
[16:38:15] <Keith> i am sure you'll settle out :)
[16:38:22] <Aria> what do y ou mean??
[16:38:35] <Keith> well you said it was a astral drunk.
[16:38:59] <Aria> yes
[16:39:00] <Keith> so then it would make sense that someone somehow manipulated your energy to give you that feeling
[16:39:09] <Aria> yea
[16:39:24] <Keith> therefore like ripples in a pond it will eventually smooth out :)
[16:39:29] <Aria> oh phwew okay
[16:39:37] <Aria> im not sure if normal drunkness lasts this long
[16:39:47] <Aria> like i know that if someone drinks alcohol they have a hangover the next day
[16:39:52] <Aria> if its a lot of alcohol
[16:40:25] <Keith> so you could have more energy in you than your body can normally handle.  or the energy isn't agreeing with you.
[16:40:39] <Aria> but no basically we were all projecting to a specific place and partying and i eventually got force fed red wine
[16:40:47] <Aria> cuz yeah, it was a party
[16:41:00] <Aria> we were on skype as well and our perceptions were aligned, we all saw the same thing, it was amazing
[16:41:09] <Keith> sweet
[16:41:23] <Aria> but just like real red wine its affecting me
[16:42:25] <Keith> give it time.
[16:42:30] <Aria> ya
[16:42:47] * Keith gives you a hug
[16:42:59] * Aria hugs Keith back
[16:43:06] <Aria> how do i detox from astral wine?! o.O
[16:43:44] <Keith> i can think of two ways
[16:43:53] <Keith> sorry three
[16:44:08] <Keith> 1. ground yourself of the energy giving you the feeling
[16:44:26] <Keith> 2. have someone realign the energy with yours so you fel fine
[16:44:38] <Keith> 3. have the energy pulled from you into someone else
[16:45:23] <Aria> can you do step 2 and 3 please?
[16:45:29] <Keith> for 2 it should be feel fine
[16:45:36] <Keith> sure
[16:45:40] <Aria> thank you
[16:45:41] <Keith> mind if i PM?
[16:45:41] <Aria> ill ground

[18:59:54] <Witchit> Well, I got used to my tarot deck after like 20 uses
[19:00:00] <Witchit> But it's the most sarcastic thing
[19:00:15] <Witchit> I asked it what my life would be like after death
[19:00:20] <Witchit> It gave me the death card
[19:00:24] * Iona listens...
[19:00:30] <Iona> well, yeah...  
[19:00:32] <Witchit> Hi Iona :P
[19:00:37] <North> sounds like a fun deck
[19:00:43] <Iona> Hi Witchit 
[19:01:00] <Witchit> Yeah, my new deck has a lot of sass, but I love it XD
[19:01:08] <North> sass  lol
[19:01:24] * Iona thinks... The Deck Named Sassy
[19:01:41] <Witchit> I might as well name it 'Sassy McSnootle'
[19:01:48] <Witchit> Good thinking Iona XD

[19:03:12] <Witchit> I'm really not surprised the deck's maker is named 'Egypt'
[19:03:22] <Witchit> Because the deck is almost unreal
[19:03:41] <Witchit> Who names their son Egypt?!

[19:04:03] <Witchit> (Or celebrities)

[19:23:35] <North> strange how they move
[19:23:51] <Witchit> I actually saw it storing nuts and got really interested

[19:32:39] <North> hail, Emanation
[19:32:40] <Aria> Well, i havent ventured much outside the part of the astral thats closely connected to the physical (remote viewing)
[19:32:43] <Iona> I see the astral plane in more of a dreamwalking context - that which affects you there affects your body too...
[19:32:51] <Aria> and apparently the place i went yesterday was inside someone's mind
[19:33:04] <Witchit> Ahhh, gotcha
[19:33:33] <Witchit> So going to the astral plane affects your mood
[19:33:40] <Witchit> Sometimes even the way you talk?
[19:33:40] <Aria> Well, it can
[19:33:49] <Aria> Yes, it can, if you get influenced there in ways like drinking alcohol
[19:34:09] <Witchit> Wow...sounds scary 0_o
[19:34:09] <Aria> but it gets even weirder if you project while being awake
[19:34:13] <Aria> which is what i did
[19:34:24] <Witchit> Oh
[19:34:29] <Aria> i could just feel myself getting drunker and drunker while being fed alcohol in the place a group of friends was projecting to XD
[19:34:38] <Aria> we all saw the same stuff happening and the same place, it was absolutely mind blowing
[19:34:40] <North> one good thing: no bar bill!
[19:34:41] <Witchit> Well as long as you're safe, that's what matters ^ ^
[19:34:45] <Aria> im safe
[19:34:48] <Aria> ...just hung over
[19:34:52] <Aria> like seriously
[19:34:55] <Aria> physical hangover from an astral party
[19:34:57] <Witchit> Heheheh
[19:35:14] <Witchit> Drink plenty of fluids, and feel free to lie down
[19:35:22] <Aria> ive been lying down all day
[19:35:29] <Aria> also ordered snackbar food
[19:35:31] <Aria> that helped a bit
[19:35:39] <Aria> also someone offered to have me dump my energy in him
[19:35:44] <Aria> that helped a bit
[19:36:06] <Aria> goooodddsss
[19:36:08] <Witchit> I wish I could help, but I've never really been around many hangovers or people who need energy
[19:36:09] <Aria> im so
[19:36:15] <Aria> how do you call it
[19:36:16] <Aria> wasted?
[19:36:56] <North> feel free to karaoke
[19:37:13] <Aria> yea ive never physically been drunk, only tipsy, so imagine my surprise when my friends were telling me I was acting drunk XD and the even bigger surprise when I was fed too much alcohol and got sick and felt like i needed to puke, until they literally took the alcohol out of my body (or some of it) because yeah, astral plane
[19:37:49] <Aria> although maybe it was the mental plane
[19:37:52] <Aria> i dont know, im confused
[19:37:59] <Aria> all i know is it was a collective reality we all went to
[19:38:08] <Aria> while talking to eachother on skype
[19:38:43] <Aria> but one of the entities in there got great enjoyment out of feeding me as much alcohol as she could.... so that wasn't so nice
[19:39:37] <Aria> also hiiiiii North 
[19:39:48] <North> lol
[19:40:07] * North salutes with his ice cream cone

[19:59:30] <Witchit> Alright...I did see images
[19:59:41] <Aria> oh then why did you say "lol sure lets go with that"?
[19:59:41] <Iona> Thanks for your patience (i continued channeling, WiFi flaked)
[19:59:57] <Witchit> Not very clear ones, and very vague since this is my first time channeling
[19:59:59] <North> because Vikings are known for their quirky sense of humour
[20:00:02] <Witchit> That's fine Iona ^ ^

[20:00:08] <Aria> ohhhhh
[20:00:09] <Witchit> I saw three images
[20:00:23] * Iona listens
[20:00:31] <Witchit> A sea landscape with a lighthouse, a bowl of fruit, and a cresent moon
[20:00:39] <Witchit> Unfortunately, I think I've failed on this one
[20:00:50] <Iona> don't judge yourself like that
[20:01:00] <Iona> it was open ended to begin with
[20:01:06] <Witchit> I can at least interpret it, but not very well.
[20:01:35] <Witchit> Nah, it's fine Iona :) I'm at least confident that I tried it
[20:01:42] <Iona> :)
[20:01:53] <Iona> Did you draw any cards?
[20:02:03] <Witchit> I didn't know that I was supposed to
[20:02:08] <Iona> no worries ;)
[20:02:14] <Witchit> Thanks for the help :)
[20:02:25] <Witchit> Do you still want the reading anyway if you tell me?
[20:02:39] <Witchit> *tell me your question?
[20:03:03] <Iona> I can't ask the question, that's why I channeled it.  That being said, what you gave me does give the right context to things...
[20:03:12] <Witchit> Really? 0_o
[20:03:15] <Witchit> I'm surprised
[20:03:25] <Iona> North: I know you like big words.  You may enjoy this.  https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/
[20:03:35] <Iona> (the title is all big words)
[20:03:39] <Witchit> I would assume that they are symbolism
[20:03:51] <Witchit> I just have trouble interpreting something too specific
[20:03:54] <Iona> Witchit: yes, and more...  
[20:04:04] <Witchit> Well that's great!
[20:04:15] <Witchit> Should I draw cards now with those in mind?
[20:04:31] <Iona> thank you for asking.  Yes, you may.
[20:04:42] <Witchit> Cool, give me a second to shuffle
[20:05:30] <Iona> ok
[20:11:24] <Witchit> I received the 'princess of wands' (this is a bit of a strange deck) You need guidance (lighthouse wise) due to your fading individuality. Something is holding you back from your creativity (bowl of fruit), and you are unsure of yourself what might happen if you lose it. You may especially be losing touch with the people around you due to this issu
[20:11:25] <Witchit> e, it may even affect your relationship with nature (cresent moon). The solution to this problem could possibly be being aware of the people you love, and in the future you should reach out to help, whatever it is you are feeling. Be brave and especially be aware. If you know the problem, think to yourself "what can I do to
[20:11:34] <Witchit> *help myself become happier?"
[20:12:32] <Witchit> I apologize if it was too vague, since I didn't understand your actual question, but I hope that at least helps
[20:14:16] <Iona> Thank you, Witchit 
[20:14:32] <Witchit> You're very welcome ^ ^
[20:15:28] <Witchit> I never get the chance to use my cards on others, and I love the fact that I channeled for the first time
[20:15:31] <Iona> What is your perspective on this?
[20:15:54] <Witchit> My perspective? :/ On my card readings?
[20:16:40] <Iona> on the feelings you channeled.
[20:16:42] <Iona> energies.
[20:16:43] <Iona> in other words, your physical response.
[20:16:46] <Witchit> Oh
[20:17:23] <Aria> i dont know whats goin on
[20:17:45] <Witchit> Well, it was very hard to do. I was nervous and had trouble concentrating. But when I got the images, I felt a lot more confident
[20:18:35] <North> Aria, I know how you feel....because SNOW here, earlier
[20:18:36] <Witchit> Did you feel my energy?
[20:18:48] <Aria> s  now???
[20:18:52] <Witchit> Oh! Aria, I was doing a tarot reading
[20:19:12] <Witchit> And now we're talking about channeling energy
[20:19:17] <North> stopped a little while ago
[20:19:30] <Iona> Witchit: since I was sending, a bit...  but I had to maintain my focus on the message I was sharing.
[20:19:35] <Aria> oohhhhhhhh
[20:19:47] <Witchit> Yeah, I'd understand that
[20:19:50] <Aria> North is there snow now???
[20:20:00] <Witchit> I was really nervous and distracted, that was probably why
[20:20:26] <North> not enough fell for any to accumulate
[20:20:29] <North> but still!
[20:20:30] <Aria> ohhhh ok
[20:20:38] <Aria> but no snowfall anymoe/???
[20:20:46] <North> all clear, atm
[20:21:25] <North> (merely cloudy)
[20:21:45] <Aria> okkk
[20:22:36] <Witchit> Oh, whoops! I didn't do the three card spread!
[20:22:48] * Iona giggles softly...
[20:22:52] <Iona> no worries...  
[20:23:05] <Iona> it doesn't have to be about me!

[23:53:31] <SpiritSong> i kind ignored them all
[23:53:32] <MissSugar> its just weird to me that a grown man would be so into a little girls show
[23:53:41] <MissSugar> it makes me want to throw up honestly
[23:54:57] <SpiritSong> meh..i doubt they have ill intentions. just an odd interest in a show
[23:55:44] <MissSugar> probably
