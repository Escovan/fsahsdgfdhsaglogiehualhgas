[05:14:19] * BansheeTears wanders off towards food

[05:14:46] <CantSirDraggin> of that i'm sure

[06:45:26] <Hrafnbjorn> ok :)
[06:45:49] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Sorta looked like gossip, so I decided to stay out of it.
[06:46:15] <MissSugar> LOL its the site we met on, one of the worst sites for pagans
[06:46:24] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ah
[06:46:46] <MissSugar> honestly the whole site is garbage, they have spells on there on how to make you a jew
[06:46:51] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I first started in the #witches room on ICQ
[06:47:28] <Pix> Yep,  among other crap
[06:47:32] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Spells ... on  ... how ... to ... make  ... a  ... Jew ... ?
[06:47:38] <Hrafnbjorn> I have learned (the hard way) to be very picky about pagan sites... very often they are insulting to Heathens, albeit unintentional
[06:47:40] <MissSugar> you a jew
[06:47:54] <raevynskkyyemt> That person from earlier should have been sent there
[06:47:57] <MissSugar> oh this site is insulting to everybody with a shred of intelligence
[06:48:09] <MissSugar> thats why i use to yell at people
[06:48:11] <MissSugar> a lot
[06:48:25] <Pix> It's a political nightmare
[06:48:34] <Pix> That's what I miss I think
[06:48:38] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Are you kidding me??  Please say "yes"\
[06:48:40] <Pix> Hahahaha
[06:48:53] <MissSugar> no you cant levitate, no you cant switch your gender, no no no you cant summon a demon with a spell
[06:49:15] <raevynskkyyemt> You shouldn't summon demons anyway. You should trap them

[06:49:46] <Hrafnbjorn> lol

[06:50:10] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Good idea

[06:52:04] <Hrafnbjorn> so, I searched today for some windows 8 apps regarding runes, but only found divination app :(
[06:52:22] <MissSugar> i wonder if pagan software still has a site
[06:53:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I shall avoid this place I don't know the way to as if it were the Sargasso Sea.
[06:53:27] <Hrafnbjorn> I wonder if folk would keep obsessing over rune divination if they knew it was created by a proto-nazi, and not traditional?
[06:53:41] <MissSugar> nvm paganheart only has divination software 
[06:55:00] <Hrafnbjorn> I should learn how to make apps, that way I could plan on making a rune app, but in end add it to list of projects I never get around to, lol
[06:55:01] <Pix> Brb
[06:55:05] <MissSugar> you should!
[06:55:13] <MissSugar> you could create a heathen app
[06:55:17] *** Quits: Pix (Pix@sorcery-vil7jr.client.mchsi.com) (Quit: http://www.kiwiirc.com/ - A hand crafted IRC client)
[06:55:37] <Hrafnbjorn> my tabet came with an app making app, but I never even opened it up
[06:56:12] <MissSugar> it could be cool, an app to learn the runes, that will create bind runes for you, that has various heathen facts
[06:56:57] <Hrafnbjorn> doing stuff about general heathenism is complicated... too much lore and diversity, so it would be tough to figure out what to add, and what to leave out
[06:57:32] <MissSugar> well maybe you could make a list of things that beginners should know
[06:57:58] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, no clue how to make something to design bindrunes... so much artistic expression in them.  For exampple, I make min so they loo bird-like
[06:58:19] <Hrafnbjorn> *look
[06:58:35] <MissSugar> maybe something that shows them overlapping and how they change when they come together
[06:59:13] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, perhaps.  I will have to download a tutorial for making apps and see how complicated it is
[06:59:44] <MissSugar> :D
[07:00:50] <Hrafnbjorn> I just found out how easy it is to mke custom icons for windows, lol... so I am gonna ake an icon for each rune stave
[07:01:29] <Hrafnbjorn> sorry about typing, I am on my tablet, and the keyboard sucks
[07:01:29] <MissSugar> oh thats a good idea
[07:01:46] <raevynskkyyemt> You get used to it hraf
[07:02:58] <Hrafnbjorn> I need finger tips that are more pointy, cause I end up hitting 2 letters at once
[07:03:33] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Or, a bigger keyboard
[07:04:14] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[07:04:32] <raevynskkyyemt> Are you on Apple or Android? 
[07:05:30] <Hrafnbjorn> its a windows 8.... not sure if the app part is android or not though
[07:06:38] <Hrafnbjorn> it was way confusing a first, cause the start screen is like an android device, but then there is also a normal windows desktop
[07:07:21] <raevynskkyyemt> It's not. I'm sure you can find a customizable keyboard in the app store
[07:07:37] <Hrafnbjorn> but I do like the d=fact I can download and use windows programs like gimp etc...
[07:08:29] <Hrafnbjorn> if I disconnect the keyboard, and use the touch keyboard it is better, but then I have to actually hold it, and I am lazy right now, lol
[07:08:48] <Hrafnbjorn> no clue how the d= got in there
[07:09:43] <Hrafnbjorn> I looked at the custom touch keyboards, but they were all hearts, and flowers, and one tat was flames... all ugly IMO
[07:10:19] <raevynskkyyemt> Lol
[07:10:35] <raevynskkyyemt> Mine is neon blue letters on a black background 
[07:11:37] <Hrafnbjorn> that would be perfect.  I will have to go look again I guess
[07:12:06] <Hrafnbjorn> checking now
[07:12:28] <raevynskkyyemt> It's SwiftKey. Has a lot of customization options 
[07:12:46] <raevynskkyyemt> Including a split screen keyboard to make typing easier
[07:14:23] <Hrafnbjorn> app store is being slow

[21:22:31] <Quadpod88> right
[21:22:35] <Widdershins> hows you all today?
[21:22:54] <Quadpod88> i saw my first catholic ceremony
[21:23:09] <Widdershins> those are lovely imo
[21:23:14] <Widdershins> what did you think?
[21:23:41] <Quadpod88> well, it was a funeral, so kinda mixed
[21:23:50] <Widdershins> ahh, Im sorry
[21:24:02] <Quadpod88> hought the preist half assed it
[21:24:14] <Quadpod88> oh, no1 i knew
[21:24:15] <Widdershins> really? 
[21:24:23] <Widdershins> thats a shame
[21:24:32] <Quadpod88> idk, thought it lacked conviction
[21:24:34] <Widdershins> was there a wake?
[21:24:44] <Quadpod88> did,nt go
[21:24:52] <Quadpod88> didn't
[21:25:11] <Widdershins> wakes are really the best part..all the reminissing
[21:25:32] <Quadpod88> not my place, i don't know any1 there, or the guy who died
[21:25:34] <Widdershins> sounds like the priest didnt know him or somethin
[21:26:18] <Quadpod88> it was so formal and so much ceremony, seemed to wash the spirit of it out
[21:26:33] <Quadpod88> if that makes sense
[21:26:48] <Widdershins> yea, thats a reason high magick doesnt appeal to me
[21:26:57] <Widdershins> too much formula
[21:27:37] <Widdershins> but i did like some of the mases i went to in Ireland
[21:27:55] <Widdershins> the energy was good and  the priest was very connected
[21:28:09] <Quadpod88> hmm
[21:28:26] <Widdershins> but it was a smaller parrish
[21:28:42] <Quadpod88> all the church services i've been to seem to have so much energy
[21:29:06] <Quadpod88> i didn't see 1 person cry
[21:29:06] <Widdershins> whats been your fave one?
[21:29:15] <H-> I never felt energy in a churg
[21:29:23] <Widdershins> wow.. sounds like a major disconnect

[21:30:05] <Quadpod88> but yeah
[21:30:09] <H-> oh yeah it's probably me disconnecting myself, I feel a lot more energy just from nature itself to be honest
[21:30:40] <Quadpod88> ot the energy i was referring to h-
[21:30:54] <Widdershins> same here- but the Covenent of uniterian universalist pagans, and the uniterian universalists are very nature oriented

[21:36:17] <SpiritSong> but not much
[21:36:38] <Widdershins> oh quad do you want to be an admon on the fb page too?
[21:36:50] <Widdershins> since you contribute so much
[21:37:06] <Widdershins> i can walk you through how to post
[21:37:22] <Widdershins> admin*
[21:37:58] <Quadpod88> nah, i still have fam i'm hiding from
[21:38:08] <Widdershins> now some of the books are adult themed
[21:38:13] <Widdershins> okies :)
[21:38:57] <Widdershins> if your admin youd only be posting as altfaiths not yourself, just in case you ever decide to
[21:39:08] <H-> Quadpod88: did you write the post about investigating hauntings ?
[21:39:11] <Widdershins> its always open to ya
[21:39:25] <SpiritSong> i see no issue with adult themes
[21:39:37] <SpiritSong> its when people sully it with imaturity that it gets messy
[21:39:48] <Quadpod88> i opened the blog, but haven't really done anything with it yet, we still a bit short on members
[21:40:15] <Widdershins> members will come with posts and advertising
[21:40:29] <H-> I was wondering, were you ever able to find anything to "prove" anything ?
[21:40:39] <Quadpod88> i posted in witchcraft
[21:41:12] <SpiritSong> Quadpod88 you blog will draw in members ^_^
[21:41:41] <Quadpod88> i have case files, but can't publish them due to security of my clients
[21:41:57] <Quadpod88> if that answers your question h-
[21:42:11] <H-> it does Quadpod88 ;)
[21:42:22] <Widdershins> ok if your on the website...log in and in the upperleft you will se a dashboard
[21:42:24] <Quadpod88> but yeah, i have proof
[21:42:24] <SpiritSong>  could yoi post them if you changed names and locations?
[21:42:51] <Widdershins> that will drop a menu and you can add a new post
[21:42:55] <Quadpod88> i meant for the actual proof
[21:43:03] <SpiritSong> ahhh
[21:43:13] <Widdershins> then, when your done adding you text or links..
[21:43:19] <H-> A part of me wants to go hunt for these hauntings aswell.. but I found out I'm a big magnet so to speak, hard to get rid of them
[21:43:23] <Quadpod88> i will post some of my findings in the blog
[21:43:24] <Widdershins> look to your bottom right
[21:43:30] <SpiritSong> well...honestly. i dont see why anyone would challnege you for proof unless they want to be a pain  :P
[21:43:41] <Widdershins> youll see a place to checkmark where to add it to
[21:44:27] <Widdershins> and feel free to link to your blog posts in here
[21:44:30] <Quadpod88> well, the problem with that h-, is that you need apprtoach all investigations as a skeptic
[21:44:38] <Widdershins> it can help keep convos going
[21:45:18] <Quadpod88> i've posted my introduction
[21:45:21] <H-> Quadpod88: yeah I know, I'm very skeptic about these things, but those that are real.. wl.. they tend to invite something more than I want
[21:47:56] <Quadpod88> well, part of my theories is that hauntings escalate through the energy we feed them
[21:48:06] <H-> all too true
[21:48:10] <Widdershins> quadpod... can you see the page ok?
[21:48:15] <Quadpod88> much like a parasite
[21:48:16] <H-> our own mind creates MUCH more than we think
[21:48:26] <Widdershins> SpiritSong is having some issues getting it to load
[21:48:31] <Quadpod88> well, not just that
[21:48:59] <Quadpod88> there is an actual reaction that causes them to get worse
[21:50:22] <Quadpod88> for example: the chemicals in the body that cause fear, actually create an exothermic reaction which releases energy into the atmosphere
[21:50:31] <H-> yeah, it's part of what I tried to explain with " our mind creates" ;) sometimes I have a hard time translating thoughts / feelings to words :o)
[21:51:03] <H-> but that too is part of what I meant
[21:53:27] <H-> oh btw, anyone familiar with the antahkarana?
