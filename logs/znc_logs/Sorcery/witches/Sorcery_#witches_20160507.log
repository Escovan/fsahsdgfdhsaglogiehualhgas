[09:12:44] <Centauri> lets say I do work for you, and thats worth a months place to live. is that money, or a transaction worth soemthing
[09:16:33] <Centauri> 'money' is simply a convenient number to put on things, its realy all about what you do vs what value I place on it

[20:17:16] <Witchit> That's...erm...well...that's not good
[20:17:22] <DawnBat> they re-arranged all my hiding spots yesterday and I', basically being forced away from my comfort zone
[20:17:45] <Witchit> Maybe you can make new ones :)
[20:17:53] <Witchit> Wait, hiding spots?
[20:18:09] <DawnBat> ye
[20:18:11] <Witchit> So like personal places you go to think?
[20:18:18] <DawnBat> I sit on the 2nd Floor and 4th Floor 
[20:18:24] <DawnBat> cause I have no internet of my own
[20:18:27] <Witchit> Oh
[20:18:38] <Witchit> Is there a library nearby?
[20:18:44] <SpiritSong> Witchit what did you make for his graduation?
[20:18:45] <DawnBat> they got rid of the table I sit at on the 2nd Floor and moved the table on the 4th Floor
[20:19:08] <DawnBat> plus it's montana and it
[20:19:12] <Witchit> SpiritSong: I'm writing a story for him about us :)
[20:19:21] <SpiritSong> why did they move them? to help you move from comfort zones?
[20:19:24] <DawnBat> it's like twelve trillion gajillion forjillion googleplex outside
[20:19:39] <SpiritSong> oooh nice witchit, you going to do a nice cover for it?
[20:19:42] <DawnBat> SpiritSong: Nah, they said they need to "update"
[20:19:49] <DawnBat> And now I have like nowhere comfortable to sit
[20:19:53] <Witchit> Is there another building you can go to DawnBat?
[20:19:57] <Witchit> Like a library?
[20:20:17] <Witchit> SpiritSong: It's more like a short story..I don't know if I'll convert it to a book
[20:20:41] <DawnBat> It's twelve trillion gajillion forjillion googleplex degrees outside
[20:20:47] <DawnBat> cause montana is a cesspool
[20:21:13] <Witchit> So there's no building within a 2 minute walk that's like a good spot?
[20:21:24] <DawnBat> pretty much
[20:21:35] <DawnBat> Plus I can't go outside without having a panic attack.
[20:21:36] <SpiritSong> sorry to hear DawnBat ::( s there anywhere else you can sit?
[20:21:49] <DawnBat> not really
[20:21:50] <Witchit> Hm...
[20:21:54] <SpiritSong> :( 
[20:22:05] <Witchit> Maybe you can arrange something with your parents
[20:22:12] <SpiritSong> Witchit a cute cover would be nice all the same i bet
[20:22:26] <Witchit> Like build something nice in the kitchen
[20:22:42] <Witchit> That would be nice SpiritSong ^ ^
[20:22:43] <DawnBat> First Floor has a crap ton of people, 2nd floor has an empty-ish lobby, 3rd floor is too open, 4th floor terrifies me, 5th is about the best place but it has a window that faces the sun
[20:22:47] <North> suggestion: a depiction of a purple people eating being shoved down a flight of stairs
[20:23:06] <DawnBat> above 5th dloor I get zero signal

[23:02:01] <SpiritSong> hahahaha adorable
[23:02:22] <Witchit> Yeah...except the whole dealing with 911 part XD
[23:02:40] <Witchit> But yeah, I was a strange disaster child
[23:02:56] <Witchit> Sometimes I still am
[23:03:39] <H-> could be worse, they have tv programms here that show people in the US calling 911 because they are so damn wasted they can't open their beer anymore
[23:03:50] <Witchit> Oh yeah, I know about those 0_o
[23:03:51] <SpiritSong> damn,,wow
[23:04:53] <Witchit> I once saw a 911 call on the news where the girl cursed at the policeman answering the call because she was panicking, and the guy hung up on her because "She was being rude"
[23:05:23] <H-> last day of his job I assume ?
[23:05:34] <Witchit> Nope, that's the worst part
[23:05:38] <Witchit> He only got 'suspended'

[23:06:36] <SpiritSong> :/
[23:06:39] <H-> the guy is not capable of his job
[23:06:47] <Witchit> There was one woman who called 911 because she got 'ripped off' from having three mcnuggets in her mcdonalds meal instead of four
[23:06:59] <SpiritSong> O_o
[23:07:00] <SpiritSong> wow
[23:07:02] <SpiritSong> ]really?
[23:07:03] <Witchit> Sorry SpiritSong, I won't talk about it anymore
[23:07:09] <Witchit> If you don't want to
[23:07:18] <Witchit> And yes, really
[23:07:30] <SpiritSong> id call if they gave me extra,,on the charge of attempted murder....mc donalds is poison
[23:07:38] <SpiritSong> noooooo
[23:07:41] <SpiritSong> you're fine
[23:07:53] <SpiritSong> im just like,,,wow
[23:07:54] <SpiritSong> kol
[23:07:56] <SpiritSong> lol
[23:07:56] <H-> haha indeed SpiritSong, I'd call 911 too if I somehow end up at mcdonalds and actually order food
[23:08:01] <SpiritSong> hahahah!!!1
[23:08:05] <Witchit> XD
[23:08:59] <Witchit> One of the weirder calls as well was the classic 'I don't know when the bus schedule is'
[23:10:02] <Witchit> It's actually a COMMON CALL in the US (either that or the taxi schedule) because they don't know to call the regular number
[23:12:20] <Witchit> In their defense, no one actually teaches people the actual number for the bus or taxi. I don't even know the local number
[23:14:49] <H-> yeah the educational system severly lacks.. but that's global
[23:15:42] <Witchit> I figured. :P
[23:16:44] <Witchit> Yeah, education really sucks when no one really cares about it

[23:17:17] <Witchit> Sotty isn't really a curse H- XD
[23:17:23] <SpiritSong> i coul understand id a stranded kid called 911 if they got lost
[23:17:24] <SpiritSong> lol
[23:17:30] <SpiritSong> that'd be smart
[23:17:52] * SpiritSong is protective of the kiddos
[23:17:53] <H-> depends on the language really :P
[23:18:01] <Witchit> Really? It is a curse? 0_o
[23:18:04] <H-> no
[23:18:07] <H-> :D
[23:18:09] <Witchit> Oh, good
[23:18:30] <H-> for example, kunt is a normal dutch word, english.. eh.. not so much :P
[23:18:40] <Witchit> But yeah Spirit, that would be a correct way of using 911
[23:19:07] <Witchit> Yeah, and there are different ways of giving the middle finger too :P
[23:19:42] <SpiritSong> what does it mean in dutch? and yeah a lot of words that are cuss words here are not in ither places and vice versa
[23:19:56] <H-> kunt basically means "can"
[23:20:01] <Witchit> I know spain has like the best curses ever XD
[23:20:03] <H-> as in, you can
[23:20:43] <H-> where's hraf's infinite wisdom when you need more examples for other languages :P
[23:20:55] <Witchit> I know right 0_o
[23:21:10] <Witchit> I could ask him the capital of Botswana and he'd know it
[23:21:24] <Witchit> -Witchit thinks about asking him to test it-
[23:21:30] <H-> and probably be able to tell you it's name in different lost languages aswell
[23:21:44] <Witchit> I already know what it is. Gaberone
[23:21:55] <Witchit> I don't GET why I know it, but for some reason I just do
[23:22:01] <H-> google ? ;)
[23:22:11] <Witchit> No, I learned it in class
[23:22:21] <Witchit> That was like the only one I remembered 0_o
[23:22:26] <H-> :P
[23:22:31] <H-> must mean something then
[23:22:46] <Witchit> Maybe Gaberone is my spirit capital XD
[23:22:53] <H-> is there such a thing ?
[23:22:57] <Witchit> Nope :D
[23:24:07] <H-> oh maybe there is in some religion
[23:24:26] <Witchit> I doubt it, but maybe ^ ^"
[23:24:30] <H-> another reason to chop someone's head of for disagreeing ;)
[23:24:41] <Witchit> Jesus H- XD
[23:25:11] <H-> I always like those discussions when people blame religion for war etc.. I always end up telling people religion is not the problem, people are
[23:25:24] <Witchit> Well for me it's half and half
[23:25:38] <H-> take away a murderer's gun and he'll grab a knife
[23:25:38] <Witchit> The people made the religion, and the religion made the people
[23:26:12] <Witchit> There are different reasons for war though, not just people using religion
[23:26:23] <Witchit> The economy, pride, etc.
[23:26:33] <H-> my point exacly
[23:26:51] <H-> when people say without religion there won't be war, I always tell them people will find another reason
[23:27:11] <H-> hence the gun/knife point
[23:28:06] <Witchit> I gotta go...it sucks because I really wanted to talk about this, but I want to continue my bf's present as well
[23:28:09] <SpiritSong> back sorry im cooking

[23:53:46] <BansheeTears> Didn't have the same air about them
[23:54:00] <SpiritSong> the ones they make now are terrrrible
[23:54:09] <BansheeTears> Agreed
[23:54:22] <SpiritSong> they dont give a nostalgia fix they just make me wish it was still the 90s
[23:54:28] <SpiritSong> the 90s were better all round
