[00:20:58] <TheAllison> aye
[00:21:07] * TheAllison lurks in the rafters
[00:22:13] <SpiritSong> hiya
[00:22:19] <SpiritSong> hows you
[00:23:04] <TheAllison> meh, I just got cussed out over the phone at work
[00:23:13] <TheAllison> so, same shizzit different day
[00:23:43] <SpiritSong> who did that? a customer?
[00:23:59] <TheAllison> someone called inquiring about our prices
[00:24:33] <TheAllison> and I had to tell them that I couldn't accept discharge papers in lieu of a military ID for the discount... because POLICY.
[00:24:41] <SpiritSong> nods
[00:24:44] <TheAllison> she flipped out like I make the rules or something
[00:24:54] <TheAllison> I just hung up tbh
[00:25:23] <SpiritSong> rude
[00:25:25] <TheAllison> the real kicker? We are only charging $52USD for a TWO double beds non smoking
[00:25:35] <SpiritSong> not bad at all
[00:25:44] <TheAllison> whereas most hotels in the area are charing $60+
[00:26:28] <SpiritSong> pricey
[00:26:35] <TheAllison> yeah compared to us
[00:26:50] <TheAllison> besides, the discount is only 10%
[00:26:58] <TheAllison> that's like a ten dollar discount... almost
[00:28:09] <SpiritSong> i guess it is a lot to vets who are home without jobs
[00:28:15] <SpiritSong> but there is no need to cuss you out
[00:28:57] <TheAllison> I agree
[00:29:07] <TheAllison> she sounded very young also
[00:29:16] <TheAllison> like maybe 17 type of young
[00:29:34] <TheAllison> and we can't rent to people under 21 as per state law
[00:29:40] <TheAllison> even if they are military

[05:14:15] <Keith> manage to get some tea?
[05:14:59] <Hrafnbjorn> yep, and took advantage of being disconnected to play with some more copper... then it got dark
[05:15:34] <Keith> i seen that pic you posted earlier.... your work is coming along quite well :)
[05:15:41] <Hrafnbjorn> Im having a lot of fun playing with copper
[05:15:58] <Keith> good to hear
[05:16:00] <Hrafnbjorn> thanks
[05:16:34] <Hrafnbjorn> although I have to admit I am surprised how much hammering it requires

[05:21:43] <Keith> rest well Alyria
[05:22:03] <Hrafnbjorn> Keith, which would you prefer to see on the website, and article about seidhr, or an article about Dansk Tonga, and how to translate runestones?
[05:22:09] <Hrafnbjorn> be well Alyria
[05:22:40] <Keith> i know virtually nothing about either topics
[05:22:49] <Keith> just that they exist
[05:23:01] <Hrafnbjorn> the one about the runestones would be far more comlicated to write, since Dansk Tonga is Viking Period language, so it would include grammar (ick)
[05:23:31] <Hrafnbjorn> seidhr is the Scandinavian psuedo shamanism and sorcery, partly borrowed from Siberian Shamanism
[05:24:02] <Keith> ummm... seidhr i guess

[11:57:42] <Keith> it does have witches and followers of other paths here :)
[11:57:59] <dfgfdgfdg> are you witch?
[11:58:00] <dfgfdgfdg> :)
[11:58:03] <Keith> no I am not
[11:58:14] <Keith> i follow my own path
[11:58:18] <dfgfdgfdg> i dont know nothing about this
[11:58:23] <dfgfdgfdg> what is your path then? :)
[11:58:44] <Keith> i follow a path of order and chaos...and weaving of energy
[11:59:44] <dfgfdgfdg> thats nice
[11:59:52] <Keith> it works for me :)
[12:01:01] <dfgfdgfdg> its good that it works for you i try to follow my path too, i am orthodox christian but i dont have success with nothing and it feels lonely at the most time :)
[12:02:08] <Keith> i am sure in time you can find a path more to your liking
[12:03:43] <dfgfdgfdg> i dont have much choice i think once i have known one witch she can read minds do you know other witches that can read minds i want to learn how they do it :)
[12:04:13] <Keith> reading minds isn't just something all witches have.
[12:04:34] <Keith> alot of what a witch has to do has to be learned, and practiced
[12:04:44] <Keith> just like anything else
[12:05:34] <Keith> of course in some cases some people are born with the ability to read minds, but they still have to practice to control it
[12:07:23] <dfgfdgfdg> she say that she is virgin and give her virginity to have skill of reading minds, i think there is one wizard again from my country he can read minds too
[12:07:49] <Keith> i have never heard of anything like that
[12:08:05] <Keith> the virginity part
[12:08:12] <dfgfdgfdg> ah
[12:08:14] <dfgfdgfdg> maybe she lie
[12:08:16] <Keith> and yes there could be a guy who could read minds.
[12:08:53] <dfgfdgfdg> i dont want this i dont think that i can use it for something it is just interesting to me :)
[12:09:01] <Keith> without knowing the person, i cant really comment on anything about them
[12:09:34] <Keith> that is fine... we have a couple other christian followers that come here once in a while

[12:27:11] <Keith> yup
[12:28:33] <dfgfdgfdg> before years one old priest (which is orthodox) say to me "you will get married" and then before 1-2 years he say again to me "we will marry you" if this guy is a prophet maybe God want to me to marry but i dont much trust on people

[12:31:28] <Keith> k
[12:32:06] <dfgfdgfdg> but prophets not exist anymore i think
[12:32:10] <dfgfdgfdg> they was in the old times
[12:32:23] <dfgfdgfdg> :)
[12:32:50] <dfgfdgfdg> i trust Bible
[12:32:56] <dfgfdgfdg> i love to read it
[12:33:17] <Keith> good to hear
[12:33:37] <dfgfdgfdg> do you have some favourite book Keith
[12:33:38] <dfgfdgfdg> :)
[12:34:04] <Keith> nope.... not a big fan of reading
[12:35:22] <dfgfdgfdg> so you like movies?
[12:36:44] <dfgfdgfdg> i think that movies are evil
[12:36:47] <dfgfdgfdg> so i dont like TV
[12:36:48] <dfgfdgfdg> movies
[12:36:55] <dfgfdgfdg> and things like this
[12:37:39] <Keith> well then you should think your computer and technology are evil
[12:38:19] <dfgfdgfdg> hah same priest told me that he want to find a girlfriend in internet so internet is not evil
[12:38:24] <dfgfdgfdg> he have mobile phone too
[12:38:52] <Keith> i'm not talking about him.  i am talking about you
[12:39:18] <dfgfdgfdg> computer is good
[12:39:21] <dfgfdgfdg> internet is good for me too
[12:39:31] <dfgfdgfdg> technology is a big word
[12:39:37] <dfgfdgfdg> it can be used for evil things
[12:39:38] <dfgfdgfdg> and for good
[12:39:45] <dfgfdgfdg> in my opinion :)
[12:39:48] <Keith> anything can be used for evil things

[12:40:45] <dfgfdgfdg> from internet once i meet a nice girl from Indonesia (we never see each other in person), also from internet i meet people who are extremely evil and i think they affected my life
[12:41:02] <dfgfdgfdg> so people must be very careful

[12:41:34] <Keith> ok
[12:41:35] <dfgfdgfdg> i talk here now i wanted to see if this is real witch channel
[12:41:36] <dfgfdgfdg> :D
[12:42:07] <Keith> yes it is a real channel that talks about different occult things
[12:42:49] <dfgfdgfdg> before time
[12:42:53] <dfgfdgfdg> i wanted to become wizard
[12:42:56] <dfgfdgfdg> and when i was a kid
[12:42:59] <dfgfdgfdg> wanted to be wizard too
[12:43:00] <dfgfdgfdg> :D
[12:43:39] <Keith> i always had a fascination with magic and stuff when i was a kid..... never really got into it until about 2001
[12:44:01] <dfgfdgfdg> and then i make bad error, i start to pray to one goddess and after time i understand that this is some witch who are in hell and try to put other people to hell too :D
[12:44:50] <dfgfdgfdg> well there is one witches forum in our language in our country
[12:44:53] <dfgfdgfdg> on internet
[12:45:01] <dfgfdgfdg> there was many people talk
[12:45:02] <Keith> ok
[12:45:06] <dfgfdgfdg> now it is almost empty
[12:45:21] <Keith> maybe they found better rooms
[12:45:42] <dfgfdgfdg> maybe i dont know
[12:45:42] <dfgfdgfdg> but
[12:45:45] <dfgfdgfdg> there was one other forum + site
[12:45:48] <dfgfdgfdg> of chaos magic
[12:45:53] <dfgfdgfdg> i enjoy to read it
[12:45:57] <dfgfdgfdg> now it is missing
[12:45:59] <dfgfdgfdg> it is closed
[12:46:18] <dfgfdgfdg> in our language too it was
[12:46:51] <Keith> nice
[12:47:11] <dfgfdgfdg> from this website
[12:47:22] <dfgfdgfdg> i learn to stay without move my body
[12:47:27] <dfgfdgfdg> and without move my eyes for 30 min.
[12:47:30] <dfgfdgfdg> 20-30 min
[12:47:35] <dfgfdgfdg> i think i can not move eyers or body
[12:47:36] <dfgfdgfdg> :)
[12:47:52] <dfgfdgfdg> this was useful for something
[12:47:58] <dfgfdgfdg> but before i learn for what because it was topic
[12:48:01] <dfgfdgfdg> the site was closed
[12:48:02] <dfgfdgfdg> :D
[12:49:50] <Keith> i hope you find a purpose for that skill
[12:50:18] <dfgfdgfdg> i think it was something about chaos magic
[12:50:29] <dfgfdgfdg> there was much information
[12:50:31] <dfgfdgfdg> on this website
[12:50:39] <Keith> perhaps they just moved the site
[12:52:16] <dfgfdgfdg> i think they closed the site
[12:52:21] <dfgfdgfdg> there was much people
[12:52:25] <dfgfdgfdg> who was interesting in magic
[12:52:26] <dfgfdgfdg> before time
[12:52:31] <dfgfdgfdg> they say all kind of magics
[12:53:28] <Keith> ok
[12:53:48] <dfgfdgfdg> that witch that can read minds tell me that she do the best she can, and then she summon a demon because she killed a pig
[12:54:07] <dfgfdgfdg> i think demons are not useful
[12:54:08] <dfgfdgfdg> for nothing
[12:54:16] <dfgfdgfdg> they can only affect our mind and body to make bad things
[12:54:17] <dfgfdgfdg> :)
[12:54:49] <Keith> k
[12:56:00] <dfgfdgfdg> but there are much worse people than witches
[12:56:07] <dfgfdgfdg> for example masons of USA
[12:56:12] <dfgfdgfdg> if they are real
[12:56:20] <dfgfdgfdg> they are more evil then all witches
[12:56:30] <dfgfdgfdg> and can do much more things
[12:57:12] <dfgfdgfdg> to make other people live like in hell
[12:57:29] <dfgfdgfdg> i guess
[12:57:30] <dfgfdgfdg> :)
[12:57:30] <Keith> have you researched mason?
[12:57:36] <dfgfdgfdg> yes
[12:57:39] <dfgfdgfdg> one at my age
[12:57:44] <dfgfdgfdg> one evil girl told me his name
[12:57:48] <dfgfdgfdg> that was my bad error in the life
[12:57:50] <dfgfdgfdg> i think
[12:57:51] <dfgfdgfdg> why? :)
[12:58:00] <Keith> nothing.
[12:58:12] <Keith> either way i am going to go for a bit.... enjoy your day

[15:39:45] <Abraxas> Welcome, QuietOne. Although love is communicated in a number of ways,our words often reflect the condition of our heart.
[15:39:47] <Aria> A discussion caused my friend to leave, and now when I talked about that I was told by an operator to stop talking or I would get banned, now a server admin (who I was kinda good friends with) told me that if I talked about it again and caused drama, I would get banned...
[15:40:12] <Aria> I've been on Occultus pre-split and after the split
[15:40:17] <Keith> yeah.... they suck balls, and not in the good way
[15:40:21] <Aria> As far as I know, the split...
[15:40:30] <Aria> well, I've been in nearly all the places people fled to
[15:40:37] <Aria> but they've all gone deserted...
[15:40:43] <Aria> which is why I'm back on Occultus
[15:40:57] <Keith> this room still goes pretty good
[15:41:02] <Keith> so i stay here
[15:41:02] <Aria> It does seem so!
[15:41:06] <Aria> But... i know nearly no one in here
[15:41:18] <Keith> then start chatting with them silly
[15:41:22] <Aria> Good point :P

[15:41:42] <Keith> howdy Aria :)
[15:41:47] <Aria> My name on IRC magick networks is Aria...
[15:41:49] <Aria> And my path...
[15:41:50] <Aria> is weird
[15:41:50] <Aria> :P

[15:42:16] <Keith> pm isn't the room so you are fine
[15:42:20] <Aria> okay ^.^
[15:42:30] <Aria> My path, um,

[15:42:35] <SpiritSong> i cant control what you do in pm
[15:42:46] <Aria> I mean, how do I explain.. I don't know what my path is XD

[15:43:27] <Aria> I combine folk magick with ritual-less magick
[15:43:31] <Keith> my path is following order and chaos... and weaving energy
[15:44:04] <Aria> Energy movement/manipulation, empathy, sensitivity, improving my extra senses...
[15:44:31] <Aria> remote viewing, astral projection..... i'm weird, I haven't found a path in which I fit yet
[15:44:51] <Keith> I am sure you will find one in time Aria :)... or be like me and create your own
[15:45:02] <Aria> I think i might already be creating my own...
[15:45:09] <Aria> But it comes with less guidance. It's undocumented...
[15:45:25] <Keith> good :)  nothing wrong with having a unique Aria-style path :)
[15:45:29] <Aria> yeah :D
[15:45:46] <Keith> i dont document anything with my path... it is just in my brain and my heart
[15:45:55] * Aria nods..
[15:46:01] <Aria> I just think of things I could do with energy
[15:46:06] <Aria> then start practicing them\
[15:46:11] * Keith nods softly
[15:46:43] <Keith> most of my magic has to do with controlling nature
[15:46:50] <Aria> What do you mean?
[15:47:08] <Keith> controlling weather and suches.
[15:47:15] <Aria> ohh....
[15:47:22] * Keith nods
[15:47:28] <Aria> I.. um.. don't believe in that
[15:47:56] <Keith> to each our own :)
[15:48:12] <Aria> yeah......
[15:49:03] <Keith> and i also practice healing as well
[15:49:05] <Aria> :D
[15:49:15] <Aria> I want to get better at that...
[15:49:54] <Keith> just takes practice
[15:50:36] *** Quits: Raggiedmon (IceChat9@sorcery-av430g.ipv6.telus.net) (Quit: Do fish get thirsty?)
[15:50:48] <Keith> bye raggiedmon
[15:52:11] <Keith> Aria do you have any friends that you practice with?? or more on your own
[15:52:23] <Aria> I do.. but they're all online, all over the world....
[15:52:31] <Aria> in places like this...
[15:52:40] <Aria> I don't have any in real life at the moment :(
[15:52:41] <Keith> good good.... I do most of my stuff on my own....
[15:52:43] <Aria> I wish I did have those
[15:52:54] <Aria> It's hard to verify whether what you're doing is actually happening
[15:52:57] <Keith> do you live in a bigger town or city??
[15:53:03] <Aria> When all you have isa friend telling you it's happening
[15:53:06] <Aria> No, I live in a small town
[15:53:45] <Keith> i know that feeling.... i just have to trust people are being honest with me, and have faith in my own abilities
[15:54:05] <Keith> perhaps one day you will move to a bigger center where you can find like minds
[15:56:59] <Aria> yes :)
[15:57:06] <Aria> And same.. I have to trust in that too.
[15:57:12] <Aria> If what they are saying is true...
[15:57:25] <Aria> Then I can do some really impressive things. But since all the proof is based on internet logs...
[15:57:25] * Keith nods
[15:57:31] <Aria> ...yeah...
[15:57:46] <Keith> yeah... you would almost have to skype it or something to hear it in their voice
[15:58:30] <Aria> yeah >.<
[15:58:32] <Aria> Welll..
[15:58:36] <Aria> I HAVE had proof via skype!
[15:58:40] <Aria> So that's a thing.
[15:58:48] <Keith> that is awesome :)
[15:58:51] <Aria> yeah :D
[15:59:07] <Keith> and all you have to do is grow like a plant :)
[15:59:40] <Aria> What do you mean?
[16:00:27] <Keith> well as a plant grows it gets more leaves, and becomes a stronger plant...each leaf is like a budding ability.  the more you grow the better they will become
[16:01:27] <Keith> make sense?
[16:01:28] <Aria> Are you saying other abilities will grow?...
[16:01:34] <Keith> it is possible.
[16:01:46] <Keith> not only grow... but also get new abilities as well
[16:02:15] <Aria> Well in my thinking, as far as I know... you gain magickal abilities by practicing them
[16:02:18] <Aria> and learning them
[16:02:21] <Aria> like any other skill
[16:02:30] <Keith> exactly... as you practice you grow
[16:02:54] <Aria> Yeah but I mean.. I thought you need to focus on a specific ability that you want to learn
[16:03:00] <Keith> no no
[16:03:33] <Keith> some times abilities can just fomr on their own
[16:03:40] <Keith> form
[16:03:54] <Aria> really? O.O
[16:04:07] <Keith> yup.... that is how most of my abilities came about
[16:04:13] <Aria> Okay... what about abilities I exhibited as a child, but that I haven't able to do since I became an adult?...
[16:04:44] <Keith> perhaps as a child you were told they were pretend and you just have blocks up right now that you need to break down
[16:05:05] <Aria> Well...
[16:05:12] <Aria> What I did amazed me so much that I doubt whether what I did was real
[16:05:53] <Keith> mind telling me what it was?
[16:06:07] <Keith> perhaps it was divine intervention to some degree.
[16:06:20] <Aria> I.. um..
[16:06:36] <Aria> I unlocked the lock on a gate with my mind
[16:06:45] <Aria> Because I desperately wanted to escape
[16:07:03] <Keith> yeah... that could have been sheer force of will, or divine intervention
[16:07:16] <Aria> Could very well have been divine intervention
[16:07:27] <Aria> I focused for about half an hour, or actually, I lost track of time... on unlocking that gate
[16:07:28] <Keith> indeed :)
[16:07:42] <Keith> i am just glad you were able to get out
[16:07:48] <Aria> Me too!
[16:07:53] <Aria> It started me on the path.
[16:07:57] <Aria> It was that significant...
[16:08:13] <Keith> some times we have to have a rough start to get to smooth sailin
[16:09:19] <Aria> Well it wasn't exactly a rough start
[16:09:34] <Aria> In fact it was one of the most amazing experiences in my life, in a time where I was desperate for magick to be real
[16:09:56] <Keith> i am just glad that you have made it to where you are
[16:09:57] <Aria> Unfortunately the person I told about it, directed me to telekinesis, and psionics
[16:10:05] <Aria> That kinda set me astray...
[16:10:34] <Keith> i see psionics and magic to be the same thing.  a manipulaation of energy
[16:11:03] <Aria> I still very much have a psionic mindset
[16:11:11] <Aria> I always prefer to do magick without a ritual, than with
[16:11:32] <Aria> But I think psionics is not the proper way for me to go
[16:11:41] <Keith> for me i do it mainly within my mind :)
[16:11:56] <Keith> whichever is most effective for you Aria :)
[16:12:50] <Aria> That is the way I am always drawn to
[16:12:57] <Aria> Ritual-less magick...
[16:13:02] <Aria> ..I just don't want to call it psionics
[16:13:26] <Keith> you dont have to.... call it whatever you want...that choice is yours :)
[16:13:34] <Keith> i call it energy weaving
[16:13:40] <Aria> energy weaving?...
[16:13:41] <Aria> hmm...
[16:13:46] <Aria> I call a part of it energy manipulation
[16:14:17] * Keith nods
[16:15:01] <Abraxas> 01,15Bulletin: Welcome to #witches. Here, you will meet and chat with multiple paths.

[16:15:06] <Aria> does energy weaving entail more than energy manipulation?
[16:15:54] <Keith> i consider it more detailed
[16:16:17] * Aria nods
[16:16:41] <Keith> but i usually work with large amounts of energy
[16:16:58] <Aria> Taken from external sources?
[16:17:02] <Aria> Or do you contain that much energy?
[16:17:07] <Keith> internal and external
[16:17:10] <Aria> Okay
[16:17:29] <Keith> though i do seem to have a large amount of internal energy
[16:17:38] <Aria> For some reason... I don't.
[16:17:46] <Aria> Like... try checking my energy...
[16:17:48] <Keith> but i really have no idea of how to gauge it.
[16:18:04] <Aria> Me neither. But I usually feel pretty weak >.<
[16:18:04] <Keith> i have troubles reading people i dont know that well.
[16:18:18] <Aria> Ohh.. that's one of the things i'm decent at :D
[16:18:28] <Keith> whenever i do something i rarely ever feel tired.
[16:18:58] <Aria> I feel tired pretty much all the time, but that may be due to my meds. Fortunately I'm tapering off of those meds.
[16:19:09] <Keith> good to hear
[16:19:15] <Aria> Yeah :D
[16:20:04] <Aria> if Occultus is not a place for me anymore...
[16:20:12] <Aria> I can still go there, but.... things are getting nasty...
[16:20:16] <Aria> can I find people to practice with here?
[16:20:29] <Aria> That's one of the main reasons I love Occultus, practicing with other online people drastically helped me improve
[16:20:42] * SpiritSong coughs
[16:20:42] <Keith> umm...... you might be able to.  but to my knowledge most of the people dont practice with each other here
[16:20:46] <Aria> oops!
[16:20:48] <Aria> sorry SpiritSong!
[16:20:52] <Aria> I need to remember that rule
[16:20:57] <SpiritSong> yup
[16:20:58] <SpiritSong> :)
[16:21:02] <Aria> What if I don't say the name of the place?
[16:21:08] <Aria> If I just say "that one chatroom"?
[16:21:12] <SpiritSong> no :P
[16:21:15] <SpiritSong> lmao
[16:21:33] <SpiritSong> cause  others will abuse the leeway even  if you wont lol
[16:21:43] <Aria> What do you mean? Abuse the leeway?
[16:22:00] <SpiritSong> some people you give them an inch they take a mile
[16:22:00] <Keith> you know the saying "give and inch and they take a mile?"
[16:22:04] <Keith> lol
[16:22:06] <Aria> :D
[16:22:06] <SpiritSong> haha
[16:22:18] <Aria> there we go, first synchronised speech already
[16:22:29] <Aria> ....anyway...
[16:22:29] <Keith> well great minds thik alike
[16:22:31] <Aria> yeah :D
[16:22:42] <Aria> I think I understand
[16:22:43] <Keith> but you can always ask a person if they want to practice with you
[16:23:01] <Aria> Would they really want to? If no one here practices together...
[16:23:13] <Keith> there might be the odd person who says yes
[16:23:24] <Keith> i know others have mentioned it before.
[16:23:24] <Aria> At the other place, people don't talk about practicing in the public room either, but it all happens in PM's ^.^
[16:23:25] <Aria> okay
[16:23:45] <Keith> just keep and eye open for people asking, and away you go
[16:23:47] <Aria> ...how do I say this without referencing it...
[16:23:49] <Aria> ..this is hard O.O
[16:24:07] <Keith> simply state you are looking for someone to practice channel energy with
[16:24:14] <Aria> yeah ^.^
[16:24:15] <Keith> chanelling
[16:24:28] <Keith> channeling

[16:26:26] * Aria giggles again
[16:26:44] <Keith> I should make some more tea.

[16:34:33] <Keith> welcome back North
[16:34:40] <North> o/
[16:35:28] * Aria writes 1 + 1 + 3 on North's back
[16:36:01] * North whips around in repeated circles, attempting to glimpse the message
[16:36:10] <Keith> North, this is Aria. Aria this is North, nick name extraordinaire
[16:36:15] <North> what'sitsaywhat'sitsaywhat'sitsay!
[16:36:26] <Aria> Keith: We already know eachother.. quite well :D
[16:36:49] * North nods to m'Aria
[16:36:57] <Aria> Well.. as far as knowing someone via text goes :3
[16:37:04] <Aria> North, it says...

[16:37:57] * Aria nodnods ^.^
[16:37:58] <North> PERFECT SENSE, LET'S SAY
[16:38:00] * Aria sees the sky turning dark
[16:38:04] * Aria turns North southward
[16:38:20] <Keith> ya silly kids
[16:38:35] * North casually causes the Earth's axis to radically tilt
[16:38:52] <North> we're the craziest kids you ever seen, Keiffer
[16:39:03] * North conservatively estimates
[16:39:20] <Keith> lol
[16:39:24] * Aria overstimulates North's estimation
[16:39:30] <North> lol
[16:39:39] <North> cheeky monkey
[16:39:50] * Aria is just throwing random sciencey words in there :D
[16:40:16] <North> haha
[16:40:16] <Keith> i wish i was overstimulated lol
[16:40:23] <Aria> why, Keith?
[16:40:34] <Keith> then i would have even more energy of course :)
[16:40:37] <Aria> True!
[16:40:43] <Keith> get my brain working better and stuffs
[16:40:51] * North tops up Keith's tea
[16:40:59] * Keith runs to get his mug
[16:41:02] <Aria> I'm currently recovering from a fever
[16:41:10] <North> oh dear
[16:41:14] <Aria> That might have been caused by withdrawing from my meds
[16:41:20] <Aria> So...
[16:41:23] <Aria> Yeah.. Low energy :o
[16:41:37] * North receives the 'recovering' part with gladness, at least
[16:41:55] <Aria> North: You might wanna scroll up and look at the discussion me and Keith had ^.^ Finally some serious discussion about magick from me, instead of 1 + 1 + 3 :3
[16:42:09] <North> lol
[16:42:14] <Keith> lol
[16:42:28] <North> <-- fan of the 1+ 1 + 3
[16:42:47] * Aria gets a #1 fan glove and rewrites the #1 to #1 + 1 + 3 fan
[16:42:53] * Aria gives the #1+1+3 fan glove to North 
[16:42:53] <North> lol
[16:42:54] * Keith turns on the fan and points it at North
[16:43:16] * North presses the glove into the sky with a glad cry
[16:43:23] <Aria> How did we start the 1+1+3 thing again? XD
[16:43:29] <Aria> How did that EVER come to be? XD
[16:43:48] <North> I'm sure it was the product of a very serious discussion
[16:43:54] * North manages this with a straight face
[16:44:02] * Aria giggles
[16:44:05] <Aria> Yes... so serious
[16:44:31] <North> no time for frivolity
[16:44:51] * North nods, topping up his coffee

[16:54:17] <Aria> The Netherlands

[16:54:53] * North reels with disbelief
[16:54:56] <Aria> and it's basically a plate
[16:54:58] <Aria> North: did I? o.O
[16:55:07] <North> well...that may be a false memory
[16:55:08] <Aria> and you put stuff on it, like meat.. or vegetables
[16:55:10] <North> but still!
[16:55:15] <Aria> and it gets grilled
[16:55:20] <Keith> oh okies
[16:55:20] <Aria> and then you eat it :D
[16:55:26] <Keith> yay cooked meats

[16:59:32] <North> I'll be seeing her today at that birthday party, in fact
[16:59:40] <Aria> I don't mean christians :P
[16:59:44] <Keith> i hope she doesnt start a fuss
[16:59:46] <Aria> I mean non-wicca magick practitioners
[16:59:49] <North> hence the earlier trip to the liquor store

[17:00:04] <Keith> i gotchas Alari
[17:00:04] <North> we get along just fine these days, truth be told
[17:00:06] <Keith> Aria
[17:00:08] <Aria> okay :)
[17:00:14] <Keith> good to hear North
[17:00:24] <North> funny how that goes
[17:00:37] <Keith> sometimes things work out better at distance :)
[17:00:43] * North nods
[17:00:52] <North> marriage tends to ruin things, I've noticed
[17:00:58] <North> generally speaking
[17:01:01] <Keith> hence me not getting married
[17:01:10] <North> good call, my friend
[17:01:16] * Keith nods and smiles
[17:01:53] <Keith> if my partner thinks we would be happier if we were married, well then i dont want to get married because we should be happy as is :)
[17:01:53] <North> every marriage relationship in my acquaintance is unenviable
[17:02:08] <North> agreed
[17:02:18] <North> and no relationship should ever be 'work'
[17:02:27] <North> contrary to popular 'wisdom'
[17:02:30] <Keith> that is right :0
[17:02:33] <Keith> :)
[17:02:44] <Keith> it should just flow like a creek
[17:03:08] <North> agreed
[17:03:50] * Keith nods lots.... like bobble head lots
[17:04:23] <North> good to keep the cervical vertebrae flexible
[17:05:21] <North> I'll never get married again
[17:06:31] <North> cost/benefit
[17:07:02] <North> the daily compromise is just too much of a drain
[17:07:28] <North> which becomes cumulative
[17:07:52] * Keith understands
[17:08:05] <Keith> Aria are you gonna get married some day?
[17:09:05] <Aria> Maybe...
[17:09:08] <Aria> I'd like to..
[17:09:51] <Keith> Aria, if you decide to I hope you find the right person :)
[17:10:03] <North> sometimes things work
[17:10:17] <Keith> indeed
[17:10:40] <North> let's say one person needs to nurture, and another person needs to be nurtured
[17:10:49] <North> painting in broad strokes here
[17:10:59] * Keith listens
[17:11:09] <North> a relatively happy relationship may result
[17:11:26] <North> needs are met on both fronts
[17:11:55] * Aria nods ^.^
[17:12:10] <Aria> I have.. weird requirements from a relationship
[17:12:23] <North> don't we all
[17:13:18] <Keith> I am a simple guy
[17:14:16] <Aria> <Keith> Aria, if you decide to I hope you find the right person :)
[17:14:18] <Aria> thank you :)
[17:14:31] <Keith> of course :)

[21:06:56] <AryRhr> my own, i like making my own software
[21:07:09] <Hrafnbjorn> ah, ok
[21:07:11] <H-> awesome
[21:07:22] <Iona> Which language are you using, AryRhr?

[21:08:29] <Iona> Hmmm
[21:08:42] <Iona> What are the bindings between Rust and C or Python like?
[21:09:23] <AryRhr> well id say Rust is like C + Ocaml
[21:09:36] <Iona> ok
[21:09:47] <H-> DONT GO THE PYTHON WAY
[21:09:48] <Iona> so you're implying that there's C bindings?
[21:09:53] <H-> wups caps
[21:10:00] <H-> python will grind to a halt
[21:10:25] <AryRhr> i used to use Ruby, but i kinda got bored from it
[21:10:31] <Iona> not for me, H-
[21:11:01] <AryRhr> if you are reffering to the syntax then theres a snippet here: http://rust-lang.org/
[21:11:03] <Iona> Thank you AryRhr, and have fun :)
[21:11:32] <Iona> that's really similar to C
[21:12:03] <AryRhr> but you cant blow up your computer, and its more memory efficient
