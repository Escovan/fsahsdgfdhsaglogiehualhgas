[06:31:04] <Escovan> well, that´s nice. You can´t grasp now how much possibility lays before you
[06:31:15] <Escovan> But life is like a pyramid.
[06:31:31] <Escovan> As you get older, your choice get limited
[06:31:38] <Escovan> Make wise choices.
[06:32:01] <emily> Ok
[06:32:22] <Escovan> I sound old
[06:32:26] <Escovan> I´m just 33
[06:32:36] <Escovan> But this is what I´ve learned
[06:32:40] <emily> Thats ol
[06:32:49] <emily> Lol
[06:33:01] <Escovan> Now I´m married, have a home, pay my bills ... 
[06:33:34] <emily> Ur old
[06:33:40] <emily> Hehe
[06:34:02] <Escovan> Choices that are limited: Going away without saying where, spending all my money on trivial stuff, and ofc. I can´t bang other women anymore.
[06:34:09] <Escovan> See: Limitation
[06:34:36] <emily> Tmi
[06:35:55] <Escovan> No, Tmi would be describing how I look atm
[06:36:29] <emily> My limitations: being 16 and a junior in hs
[06:37:57] <Escovan> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHIIATt0BaM
[06:38:09] <Escovan> Little piece of history for you :P
[06:38:36] <emily> Describe hisory ^
[06:39:05] <Escovan> Well, when I was younger, there was no internet :o
[06:39:29] <emily> Your ancient!!!!!!!
[06:39:41] <Escovan> I´ve actually went to highschool without a cellphone!
[06:39:42] <emily> How could u live!!!!!!
[06:40:06] * emily screams amd hkdes in shell
[06:40:09] <emily> Hides
[06:40:23] <emily> How could u live!!!!!!
[06:40:43] <Escovan> I had a Commodore64 on which I could write BASIC-programs.
[06:41:01] <emily> ?........
[06:41:18] <Escovan> ancient computer without internet :P
[06:41:54] <emily> Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
[06:42:58] <emily> Im in game devlopmemt
[06:44:01] <Escovan> hmmm, you need to be very - no extremely - good at that, and teamwork, if you ever want to make a living out of that.
[06:44:27] <emily> I also play piano
[06:45:45] <Escovan> I´m disabled (sick in the head), but I´ve studied Network Administration ... and I also try to play keyboard now... got one from a friend recently.
[06:46:09] <emily> Keyboards r easy
[06:46:26] <emily> Thy only have half of what a reg piano has
[06:47:00] <emily> Reg piano has 88 keys keyboard only has 40
[06:49:50] <Escovan> I´m still in the phase of learning what key is what note :P I can play a tune of one line now, but I need to practice more.
[06:50:55] <emily> One measure
[06:51:24] <emily> The notes only go up to G
[06:51:25] <emily> Lol
[06:52:14] <Escovan> well I´ve spent 25 years understanding computers, I will spend 25 more to master this thing. I love music, but making it is a different story.
[06:53:00] <emily> Haha it only tok me 4 years to learn...plus a choir
[06:53:34] <Escovan> it´s probably like with languages: The sooner you begin, the easier it is.
[06:53:56] <emily> Musics harder
[06:54:42] <emily> But its good stimulus for the brain
[06:55:32] <Escovan> I can at least hear when I press a wrong key ... so that´s good right? I´m not musically disabled :P
[06:55:43] <emily> Lol
[06:57:20] <Escovan> actually I need a tutor and spend an hour every day ... But that´s a lot of computer fixing to pay for keyboard lessons...
[06:57:51] <emily> Im self taught....
[06:58:17] <emily> Try YouTube videos..it helped me
[06:58:29] <Escovan> Ok

[17:01:23] <SpiritSong> did you get a pic Hrafnbjorn?
[17:01:36] * SpiritSong gives Hrafnbjorn bandaids :(
[17:02:17] <Hrafnbjorn> no, not yet... I made so much stuff last 2 weeks that I stopped taking photos, lol.  
[17:04:02] <Hrafnbjorn> I was a little upset with the horse I woodburned (on a wood box) cause I spent several hours with shading after I did the main pattern, but then when I stained the wood, it removed a lot of the shading
[17:04:39] <Hrafnbjorn> irt still looks good, I was just frustrated with the waste of time
[17:04:45] <Hrafnbjorn> *it
[17:11:03] <SpiritSong> sorry back
[17:11:21] <Hrafnbjorn> wb
[17:11:34] <SpiritSong> tyats a shame :( but i bet it look great all the same
[17:11:41] <SpiritSong> id love to see a pic of it
[17:12:23] <Hrafnbjorn> I will take a pic once it stops raining.  The light inside isnt good enough
[17:15:53] <SpiritSong> ahh
[17:15:57] <SpiritSong> same in my house
[17:16:09] <SpiritSong> but the wind outside would blow away aything here lol
[17:16:36] <Hrafnbjorn> its not been windy here thankfuly
[17:18:08] <Hrafnbjorn> I spent most of the day yesterday fixing sprinkler line over at my moms, and the rain alone made it miserable to dig, wind would have made it impossible.  The ground here is rock hard when dry, but turns to slime when it gets wet cause its a mix of red clay and volcanic ash
[17:19:29] <Hrafnbjorn> the volcanic ash is microscopic glass, so it is like having sandpaper covering your hands while ya dig.  At least my skin is smooth and shiny now, lol
[17:21:15] <SpiritSong> :( that sounds horrible,,,soggy and awful lol

[18:25:29] <Witchit> That may not happen, however, as my cat is a derp and would rather sit on my hands while I type
[18:25:40] <North> haha
[18:25:51] <North> sure does look comfy
[18:26:01] <Witchit> What is seriously more comfortable to this cat, a hard keyboard or a soft pillow
[18:26:44] <Witchit> Anyway, I'm doing commissions for pretty much anything right now
[18:26:50] <Witchit> Bags, beds, etc.
[18:26:57] <North> cats: less than 100 % rational
[18:27:04] <Witchit> EXACTLY
[18:27:22] <Witchit> I'm like "cat, I need that bag" -Cat sits anyway- "OIENGIONEGIGEN"
[18:27:42] <North> <-- typing one handed now, because ice cream cone, btw
[18:27:57] <Witchit> It's all cool, you're doing better than me at least :P
[18:28:15] <North> o/
[18:28:23] <Witchit> If I had an ice cream cone in one hand I'd say "brb heaven in hand"
[18:28:29] <North> lol
[18:28:41] <North> no exaggeration there
[18:28:56] <Witchit> I would just drop anything for that cone, because that's who I am.
[18:29:06] <Witchit> -drops computer- -grabs cone-
[18:29:14] * North nods
[18:29:33] <Witchit> -computer breaks- -stands there licking ice cream-

[18:31:27] <North> IT'S EZ
[18:31:38] <Witchit> XD
[18:32:33] <Witchit> I really resort to horrible spelling purposefully because I don't know, llamas
[18:33:21] <Witchit> Speaking of horrible things, cyclists are ruining my life
[18:33:35] <North> how so
[18:33:58] <Witchit> Damn cyclists with their riding on the roads and causing traffic and going through the lights just to mock me
[18:34:20] <North> bastards
[18:34:43] <Witchit> And their tight outfits and their smug punchable faces
[18:34:49] <North> lol
[18:34:54] <North> truth
[18:34:58] <Witchit> Cyclists.
[18:35:09] <Witchit> I hate cyclists with a passion.
[18:35:15] <Witchit> (Not really, but really.)
[18:35:40] <North> preaching to the choir, sister
[18:35:59] <Witchit> Heheheh XP I always find a way to hate cyclists
[18:36:12] <Witchit> That, or I'm getting old at age 20
[18:36:13] <North> and why not
[18:37:03] <Witchit> Because aaagh! They hog like 70% of my stupid time looking at their butts in front of our car
[18:37:05] <North> if hating cyclists is old, I don't wanna be young
[18:37:16] <North> lol
[18:37:33] <Witchit> They freaking turn around and cross the street without warning
[18:37:43] <Witchit> WE'RE NOT IN NEW YORK CITY GUYS
[18:37:52] <Witchit> YOU CAN ACT LIKE CIVIL BEINGS
[18:37:59] <North> >:(
[18:38:14] <North> KILL THEM ALL
[18:38:19] <North> too far
[18:38:26] <Witchit> Okay, not that far XD
[18:38:34] <North> ;)
[18:38:46] <Witchit> It's like murdering someone and when the police asks why I'm like "They're cyclists"
[18:38:50] <Witchit> "What do you expect"
[18:39:19] <North> no court in the land would convict you
[18:39:46] <Witchit> XD True. "Yeah it was brutal murder, but she had glitter on her bike. GLITTER.
[18:39:48] <Witchit> *"
[18:40:01] <North> lol
[18:40:09] <Witchit> Oh god why do dads take their children with them
[18:40:26] <Witchit> It's the middle of the street, I DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE
[18:40:40] <North> lunacy
[18:40:54] <Witchit> AND WHEN THEY GET THEIR STUPID BIKES ACROSS, THEY TURN AND GO YOLO LOL SWAG
[18:41:03] <Witchit> AND THEN CROSS AGAAAAIN
[18:41:32] <North> just unacceptable
[18:41:56] <Witchit> Okay, enough ranting, I sometimes go overboard when talking about something XD
[18:42:17] <North> expression is healthy
[18:42:24] <North> or something
[18:42:46] <Witchit> Yeah, but when you're ranting about cyclists and how they shouldn't be existing it kind of goes far :P
[18:43:05] * North shrugs
[18:43:08] <Witchit> Especially since they DON'T FOLLOW TRAFFIC RIGHT OH GOD
[18:43:19] <North> haha
[18:43:27] <Witchit> Okay, okay, I'm done. I think..
[18:43:51] <North> TAKE THAT, CYCLISTS
[18:43:52] <Witchit> I just like ranting, it's something I do XD
[18:43:58] <Witchit> YES.
[18:44:09] <Witchit> (I almost typed a curse)
[18:44:19] <Witchit> (So I'll just do this)
[18:44:25] <Witchit> FLIP cyclists!
[18:44:30] <North> oh, I know all about that thing you do
[18:44:37] <Witchit> o3o
[18:44:46] <Witchit> Wut
[18:45:02] <North> (ranting)
[18:45:04] <Witchit> Oh
[18:45:16] <North> FORGET YOU, CYCLISTS
[18:45:29] <Witchit> I was so confused, I thought you were talking about knowing too much about me XD
[18:45:36] <Witchit> I was like "okay, not creepy..?"
[18:45:43] <North> ahhh, k
[18:46:06] <Witchit> But yes. Ranting. Something I tend to do that pisses people off. XD
[18:46:28] <North> just another crazy irc misunderstanding
[18:46:38] <Witchit> My boyfriend thinks it's cute though, so that's nice
[18:47:03] <Witchit> You and my bf are pretty much the only ones who like my rants :P

[18:52:58] <ronin> oh i see
[18:53:09] <Witchit> It's okay dude :) Need anything?
[18:53:13] <ronin> ssomeone was feeling down and depressed but i wanted to tell her her prayyer worked
[18:53:21] <ronin> for that person
[18:53:31] <Witchit> Ooh, nice!
[18:53:41] <Witchit> I'm sure she'll be back
[18:53:43] <ronin> eh i need to be less overtired but
[18:53:58] <ronin> you know spiritual people get a christmas list of things to be magicked/prayed about
[18:54:35] <Witchit> I know how you feel...every time I get a tarot reading, people always ask about love
[18:55:35] <Witchit> And it turns into this kind of drug for them
[18:55:58] <Witchit> Where they want to keep coming back because they want hope when I already told them yes or no

[18:57:36] <Witchit> Yeah...it's pretty scary sometimes to see them rely too much on the cards and not the meaning itself
[18:57:53] <ronin> ah
[18:58:18] <Witchit> It's like whatever they get is "definite" and either is good or bad
[18:58:30] <Witchit> And that's not true in my opinion
[18:58:46] <Witchit> Nothing with tarot is truly good or evil
[18:59:02] <ronin> oh i had this convo with someone an hour earlier
[18:59:11] <Witchit> Interesting :)
[18:59:17] <Witchit> Thoughts?
[19:00:41] <ronin> some things are neither benefcial or harmful
[19:00:47] <ronin> they are inbetween
[19:01:02] <North> I like to eat an ice cream cone down to the point where it's only a couple of inches high, then I bite off the tip and suck out the semi-liquid ice cream
[19:01:09] * North makes an important contribution
[19:01:36] <Witchit> Thank you North, very insightful XD
[19:01:41] <North> :D
[19:01:59] <Witchit> I actually used to do that as a kid!
[19:02:02] <Witchit> But anyway
[19:02:18] <North> funfunfun
[19:02:24] <Witchit> Yeah, I believe you're right ronin
[19:02:41] <Witchit> I never truly liked the concept of pure good or pure evil
[19:02:54] <ronin> wel what we do you know
[19:03:38] <Witchit> Sorry, do you mean I know more than I'm letting on?
[19:04:39] <ronin> no it's just a general observation
[19:04:44] <ronin> about human activity
[19:04:56] <Witchit> Oh
[19:05:12] <Witchit> I didn't really get the sentence you said :/
[19:05:42] <North> the last time I had an ice cream cone, a sizeable crack appeared in the cone
[19:05:49] <North> making the whole experience A RACE AGAINST TIME
[19:06:02] <Witchit> Very deep North. Very deep.
[19:06:23] <Witchit> Aren't we all just racing through time?
[19:06:23] * North nods rather somberly
[19:06:34] <North> NOW WHO'S THE DEEP ONE
[19:06:39] <Witchit> XD
[19:06:43] * North points, in case there was any doubt
[19:06:48] <ronin> ah i have to head out
[19:06:53] <Witchit> Alright!

[19:07:02] <ronin> bye
[19:07:22] <Witchit> Geez, deep conversations are deep
[19:07:27] <North> that'll teach us for being born
[19:07:37] <Witchit> <--- Watched Pokemon XY for like an hour
[19:07:42] <Witchit> <-- claims to be deep
[19:08:18] <North> a well earned break from profundity
[19:08:55] <Witchit> Exactly
[19:09:10] <Witchit> Especially when you're watching Team Rocket blasting off AAAGGGAAIINN
[19:09:21] <North> lol
[19:09:42] <North> essential steps on the path to wisdom
[19:09:45] <Witchit> I love pokemon. I like digimon more, but Pokemon is so silly you can't help but not love it XD
[19:10:14] <North> there must be eleventy-seven thousand characters by now
[19:10:21] <Witchit> Oh god yes.
[19:10:31] <Witchit> I think there's over 800 pokemon now
[19:10:37] <Witchit> Plus mega evolutions
[19:10:47] <Witchit> Which means they're the same pokemon only MEGA

[19:11:56] <North> and Christmas is practically around the corner
[19:11:57] <Witchit> Guys. Stop. We have like a thousand games
[19:12:09] * North imagines Witchit hopping from one foot to the next in anticipation
[19:12:35] <North> although perhaps not
[19:12:46] <Witchit> Heheheh, nah, I'm telling myself to not get any Pokemon games because then I'll go insane XD
[19:13:14] <North> we'll see how that goes, I guess
[19:13:45] <Witchit> I still watch the anime, and I have to say XY is my favorite one out of the MULTIPLE series
[19:13:52] <Witchit> GUYS. STOP. REALLY.
[19:14:11] <North> STOP CAPTIVATING WITCHIT'S ATTENTION, JEEZ
[19:14:15] <Witchit> XD
[19:14:32] <Witchit> I just really like being impressed by the geeky guy in the anime

[19:15:33] <North> pure catnip to the female species
[19:15:59] <Witchit> Heheheh, I guess. Beforehand it was jocks in middle school, which I didn't like myself
[19:16:18] <North> changing times
[19:16:28] <Witchit> Now everyone likes the geeks because it's a trend. I like my bf because he's geeky in a special way
[19:16:57] <Witchit> But I guess now it's popular to obsess over the gamers and technicians
[19:17:05] <North> new world order
[19:17:26] <Witchit> Yeah...I hate that girls now flock to geeks because it's popular
[19:17:45] <Witchit> Like what you like, don't go for the trend
[19:18:03] <North> 'like what you like'
[19:18:09] <North> ^   likes
[19:18:32] <Witchit> In middle school, I wore certain clothes that everyone teased me for. At the high school reunion, they wore the same clothes because it was a trend
[19:18:45] <North> maddening
[19:18:45] <Witchit> They LITERALLY followed their own bullying
[19:19:13] <North> did it give you a modicum of satisfaction?
[19:20:12] <Witchit> No, it made me angry actually...they only wanted to wear those clothes because it was a trend, and beforehand they made me suffer for looking a certain way
[19:20:22] <Witchit> Then they just turn around for fashion
[19:20:27] * North nods
[19:20:49] <North> people can be way too fickle
[19:21:59] <Witchit> I hated my middle school especially, since they always liked to put me down....one time they were showing a slideshow of the field trip I was on...I was shown in a picture with popular girls. They didn't know whether to cheer or boo
[19:22:34] <Witchit> It really, really sucked. When I say the school was against me, I actually mean the school was against me
[19:22:57] <North> sad
[19:23:21] <North> and time seems to go on forever in those years
[19:23:40] <Witchit> Yeah...I was bullied from preschool to senior year of high school
[19:23:56] <North> glad you survived
[19:23:57] <Witchit> I had to change 4 different schools in my high school years
[19:24:05] <Witchit> I'm glad too :)
[19:24:27] <North> you must've been astonished when things finally started to turn around
[19:24:46] <Witchit> I was amazed to see people actually want to sit next to me in class
