[00:00:18] <Hrafnbjorn> lemme see if I can find a good link
[00:02:26] <DawnBatGuano> seems like Loki was the most favorable for shapeshifting
[00:03:32] <Hrafnbjorn> I dont see any good sites to describe it... you can look it up in Gylfiginning (Snorris Edda) and Grimnismal (Saemundr's Edda) though
[00:03:58] <Hrafnbjorn> all web sites say is its home of the aesir, which is entirely vague, lol
[00:05:16] <DawnBatGuano> Ahhh
[00:05:27] <DawnBatGuano> I'd assume it'd be incromprehensible then
[00:05:34] <Hrafnbjorn> this one is decent I suppose: http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Asgard
[00:06:38] <DawnBatGuano> hmm
[00:06:41] <DawnBatGuano> that is vague
[00:06:48] <DawnBatGuano> Ragnarok sounds like a fun time!!!
[00:07:25] <Hrafnbjorn> not likely, lol
[00:07:44] <DawnBatGuano> doom and destruction?
[00:07:48] <DawnBatGuano> Possible fire and brimstone?
[00:09:08] <Hrafnbjorn> well, doom yes, but not by our common use... fire certainly
[00:09:23] <DawnBatGuano> and Fenrir unleashed...right?
[00:09:44] <Hrafnbjorn> Ragnarok translates to doom/debt of the gods
[00:09:54] <DawnBatGuano> Ahhh
[00:09:59] <Hrafnbjorn> Fenrir and Loki are released befoe it, yeah
[00:10:25] <DawnBatGuano> and Fenrir is pretty much super-evil yes?
[00:11:47] <DawnBatGuano> wait, is there a clear description of evil in said culture
[00:12:26] <Hrafnbjorn> there is no evil beings... Fenrir was bound because of prophesy
[00:12:59] <Hrafnbjorn> Odin's wife, Frigga had a dream Fenrir would eat Odin, so they bound him in magic ribbon
[00:13:10] <DawnBatGuano> a ribbon?
[00:13:15] <DawnBatGuano> energy or like mystic fabric
[00:13:40] <Hrafnbjorn> mystic fabric, forged by dwarves/dark-elves
[00:14:24] <DawnBatGuano> Oh fun
[00:14:36] <DawnBatGuano> I'd like some :p

[00:17:37] <DawnBatGuano> a reset would be nice in a sense
[00:17:57] <Hrafnbjorn> no we dont need it, as that implies WE are somehow so important that we are the deciding factor

[00:19:38] <DawnBatGuano> Besides valhalla, is ther another afterlife...or is it just Hel?
[00:19:57] <Hrafnbjorn> Hel, and Folkvang
[00:20:25] <Hrafnbjorn> half the battle slain go to valhalla, the other half to Folkvang... Freyja gets first choice, which she takes to Folkvang
[00:20:47] <DawnBatGuano> and Folkvang isss?
[00:21:20] <Hrafnbjorn> means "Field of the folk" it is Freyja's hall
[00:21:32] <DawnBatGuano> is it better than what I have hear of Hel?\
[00:22:36] <Hrafnbjorn> depends on the person... Hel is best IMO.  Folkvang doesnt come with any desription as far as what the folk there do, or why they are taken there, etc.  It only says Freyja gets first choice for her half which go to Folkvang
[00:22:52] <DawnBatGuano> I've heard Hel is grey and such
[00:23:05] <Hrafnbjorn> ya heard wrong
[00:23:20] <DawnBatGuano> Oh
[00:23:25] <DawnBatGuano> What would it be like?
[00:23:42] <Hrafnbjorn> there are different levels of Hel, the bad one, Nifelhel is a place of cold and mist
[00:23:52] <DawnBatGuano> oooh fun, not
[00:24:04] <Hrafnbjorn> the Hel the vast majority of men and gods go to is a place of reunification with ones folk
[00:24:11] <DawnBatGuano> I kinda like that actually
[00:24:53] <DawnBatGuano> did the Scandinavians have a specific view on lgbt ?
[00:25:01] <DawnBatGuano> I use the new term for reasons
[00:25:33] <Hrafnbjorn> um, yes, but not exactly a possitive one
[00:25:48] <DawnBatGuano> Oh fun
[00:25:56] <DawnBatGuano> in Kemet it's rather obscure actually
[00:26:37] <Hrafnbjorn> they distinguished between the 2 involved... the 'reciever' was frowned down upon (called ergi/argr) but homosexuality in general didnt get mentioned
[00:26:39] <DawnBatGuano> its mentioned in The Book of The Dead somewhat but beyond that there's prtty much nada
[00:27:12] <Hrafnbjorn> to them it was a matter of being 'unmanly' more than the acts themselves
[00:27:29] <DawnBatGuano> Yeah, they were a very patriarchal society right
[00:28:04] <Hrafnbjorn> things used to be very different... sexuality was not so polarized as it is today, where we have 3 basic forms, homo, hetero, and bi
[00:28:09] <DawnBatGuano> Yeah
[00:28:49] <DawnBatGuano> In Kemet it was generally acknowedged I believe there was alternative ways to enter The True Afterlife (for a lack of better words)
[00:29:13] <Hrafnbjorn> so it was common all throughout Eurasia for an older man to take on a younger student, and that student was expected to perform services, but it was not seem in that 3 part way we see it today
[00:29:25] <DawnBatGuano> ohhh
[00:29:33] <DawnBatGuano> I know in Sparta it was done as a bonding form.
[00:29:41] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[00:30:00] <DawnBatGuano> the Sacred Band of Thebes was a fight harder in a sense

[02:13:28] <Alyria> Excellent, thanks. Best trip yet. Evie was a very good girl the entire time and remembered family so that I didn't have to ask her to say goodbye-I-love-yous, she said it to everyone because she meant it.
[02:13:39] <Alyria> And my mother was quite tolerable.

[02:14:33] <North> big difference from the first Evie flight, I can't help but wager

[02:47:33] <SnakeEyes> Hi SpiritSong :)
[02:47:47] <Hrafnbjorn> there is actualy a contradiction in the lore regarding Modi (Thors son) because it says Thor is the strongest wight, yet Thor needed his magic girdle and gauntlets to weild mjolnir... Modhi was able to weild it without those
[02:47:50] <SpiritSong> if you must poke me with food at least make sure it is fresh
[02:48:02] <DawnBatGuano> nah
[02:48:09] <DawnBatGuano> it's roughly 600 years old.
[02:48:12] <DawnBatGuano> Well preserved too
[02:48:59] * Iona pokes SpiritSong with a fresh-picked tomato (as opposed to a thrown old one)
[02:49:25] <SpiritSong> lol thankss iona and hi
[02:49:31] * SpiritSong reads Hrafnbjorns words
[02:49:33] <Iona> hello :)
[02:49:41] <Hrafnbjorn> wb SpiritSong
[02:50:22] <SpiritSong> ty:)
[02:50:47] <SpiritSong> DawnBatGuano, if you really want to know how a banshee cried...google keening in ireland
[02:50:59] <DawnBatGuano> sounds scary
[02:51:11] <DawnBatGuano> I've had enough experience with Charmed :P
[02:51:28] <SpiritSong> its an old tradition held at wakes and funeral. the family would hire a professional mourner who would give the dead a good crying about , wailing....
[02:51:53] <DawnBatGuano> Kemet did the same
[02:51:56] <SpiritSong> in irish culture, and othe cultures, to have a keener at your loved ones funeral was a sign of how deeply loved and missed the person was
[02:51:58] <DawnBatGuano> hired wailrs
[02:52:10] <SpiritSong> oh wow i ddidnt know that. is it for the same purpose?
[02:52:33] <DawnBatGuano> Probably
[02:52:37] <SpiritSong> Hrafnbjorn is there any tradtions like that in your path?
[02:52:47] <DawnBatGuano> I haven't come across it yet again
[02:52:58] <SpiritSong> nods
[02:53:57] <Hrafnbjorn> in a way, yes, but not exactly crying... depending on social rank, a mans slave(s) or sometimes even his wife would be sacrificed with him... not crying, but similar in a way
[02:54:02] <DawnBatGuano> I shall hire SpiritSong as my wailer

[02:54:20] <SpiritSong> ah so a scrificed in instead of a professional mourner
[02:54:26] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah
[02:54:30] <SpiritSong> but simlar meanings
[02:54:38] <SpiritSong> to show how important the person was to the family
[02:55:21] <DawnBatGuano> go home SpiritSong, you drunk :P
[02:55:32] <Hrafnbjorn> according to Ibn Fadlan, if it was a slave, it was female, and she would have relations with the deceased's family, by doing so she recieved her free-status, and became part of the family
[02:56:28] <Hrafnbjorn> thats all part of the aspects of Heathenism lft to the past though... no sacrificing slaves anymore ;)
[02:56:29] * SpiritSong givees you the benifit of a doubt that that wasnt an irish drinking joke
[02:56:38] <DawnBatGuano> SpiritSong: it was the spelling
[02:56:43] <SpiritSong> ahhh ;)
[02:56:45] <SpiritSong> ok
[02:56:47] <DawnBatGuano> Hrafnbjorn: Wasn't there a tradition for marrying the dead?
[02:57:07] <Hrafnbjorn> no
[02:57:09] <DawnBatGuano> Ah
[02:57:16] <DawnBatGuano> I was wrong then, wrong atrea
[02:57:42] <SpiritSong> but otherwise she would be sacrficed?
[02:58:16] <Hrafnbjorn> marriage back then could not have taken place with the dead... someone could symbolicaly marry, but it was to a family member... marriage required both paerties to speak the desire to marry 3 times in private, and 3 times in public... a dead man cant speak those words
[02:58:33] <DawnBatGuano> Ah
[02:58:52] <Hrafnbjorn> yes SpiritSong
[02:58:54] <DawnBatGuano> I know it was done in Romania ( I think ) so I though there might be something similar or same
[02:59:08] <DawnBatGuano> also considering ya know
[02:59:09] <DawnBatGuano> Draugr
[02:59:13] <SpiritSong> so the would be marrying a family member, in memory of their ,,,um master
[02:59:27] <DawnBatGuano> SpiritSong: sounds fun
[03:00:12] <Hrafnbjorn> to be fair, there was almost 3000 years of no lore record for Heathenism, so there may have been periods in past when they were still more closely related to the curgan culture, and in that time they MAY have married the dead <shrug>
[03:00:20] <DawnBatGuano> Ahhh

[03:00:38] <Abraxas> Welcome, hihospaghettio. The person who looks outward dreams, the person who looks inward awakens.
[03:00:49] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, since the family inherited the wealth and debt of the dead, the slave marrying a family member was part of that
[03:00:53] <DawnBatGuano> I actually would like some assistance btw.

[03:01:36] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa agent199!
[03:03:10] <DawnBatGuano> I wish to make a story of say an Oracle or Elysian who travels the multiverse, many places would be similar to what we have in past folklore.
[03:03:11] <hihospaghettio> everyone doing all right I hope?
[03:04:21] <Witchit> Whoops 0_o I forgot I left chat open
[03:04:23] <DawnBatGuano> for example. One of the Chaos Realms would be like, Hrafnbjorn : what was the lowest level of Hel?
[03:04:54] <Hrafnbjorn> you would also need the interpreter to travel with her, DawnBatGuano... cause the oracles, especialy those form the Elysian cults didnt speak the prophesy, they spoke jibberish, and the translater conveyed the message to the querrant
[03:05:02] <Hrafnbjorn> Niflhel
[03:05:15] <DawnBatGuano> Niflhel
[03:05:17] <DawnBatGuano> aight
[03:05:35] <DawnBatGuano> I see these Oracles as more of watchers, whereas the Elysians normally interfere more
[03:07:03] <Hrafnbjorn> I see
[03:07:55] <DawnBatGuano> Oracles would probably be seen as jibberish since they inherit more nature-esque forms
[03:08:11] <DawnBatGuano> trees, shrubberies and so on
[03:08:53] <DawnBatGuano> possible for an Oracle to take on a fountain or waterfall ?
[03:09:30] <Hrafnbjorn> your story = your rules
[03:09:49] <DawnBatGuano> Well I wanted to make it somewhat accurate
[03:10:11] <DawnBatGuano> really I just thought the best analogue would be Grandmother Willow from Pocahontas but that's me
[03:10:35] <Hrafnbjorn> historic oracles were often drug addicts, and what most would consider insane
[03:10:48] <Hrafnbjorn> they were fringe dwellers
[03:11:06] <DawnBatGuano> I was thinking of the more mythic ones ... but there were actual mortal ones?
[03:11:19] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah
[03:11:30] <DawnBatGuano> Never knew that!
[03:11:32] <Hrafnbjorn> still mythic, but portrayed as human
[03:11:37] <DawnBatGuano> Ahhh
[03:11:46] <hihospaghettio> if you really think about it, oracles today would be looked at as the same
[03:12:02] <hihospaghettio> if I went around raving the waters or a burning bush told me what is going to happen, they would lock me up
[03:12:03] *** Iona is now known as Iona`afk
[03:12:11] <DawnBatGuano> hihospaghettio: probs
[03:12:12] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed
[03:12:23] <DawnBatGuano> This story usually takes place in another Mortal Existence
[03:12:27] <DawnBatGuano> or other planes
[03:13:06] <Hrafnbjorn> the temple where the Oracle @ Delphi was confined, for example, sat on tp of volcanic vents, and the gasses released were intoxicants
[03:13:10] <DawnBatGuano> I recently added a place called Genesis, being the leftovers of creation.
[03:13:13] <DawnBatGuano> Hrafnbjorn: oh my
[03:13:42] <Mim> :)
[03:14:03] <DawnBatGuano> I thought it'd be entirely plausible for a creator entity (when making the multiverse) be so weak they'd just dissipate

[03:57:03] <hihospaghettio> yeah thats right, hei'an means black, dark, respectively
[03:57:07] <hihospaghettio> and gongdian is palace
[03:57:12] <hihospaghettio> do you want the chinese for it?

[04:02:02] <hihospaghettio> so what you are saying is I will have thrown my trash at my wall
[04:03:41] <DawnBatGuano> well the hole is fairly recent
[04:04:09] <DawnBatGuano> especially since one of The Incarnations of Genesis ( the manifestations of said creation leftovers ) broke into your realm
[04:04:38] <hihospaghettio> did he screw up my beieber poster?
[04:04:42] <hihospaghettio> if so, he's going down
[04:05:10] <DawnBatGuano> Well
[04:05:17] <DawnBatGuano> I'm speaking of the Ming Dao realm
[04:05:54] <hihospaghettio> clear way realm?
[04:07:06] <DawnBatGuano> it's a similar but more mythical version of China
[04:07:09] <DawnBatGuano> Ancient China
[04:07:13] <DawnBatGuano> so probably
[04:08:14] <hihospaghettio> nice! why china, if I may ask?
[04:08:54] <DawnBatGuano> i've always loved there
[04:09:01] <DawnBatGuano> and they have amazing mythical creatures
[04:09:22] <hihospaghettio> that's funny, most people go for japanese culture

[04:11:22] <DawnBatGuano> :3
[04:11:24] <Hrafnbjorn> oddly enough, most Japanese folk can tell you more Chinese mythology than the indigenous mythology
[04:11:33] <DawnBatGuano> oh my
[04:11:44] <DawnBatGuano> hihospaghettio: wait you skinny or? If so reverse lypo
[04:11:59] <hihospaghettio> oh no, I'm not skinny at all by asian standards, lol
[04:11:59] <Hrafnbjorn> or maybe its not consodered mythology, but Taoism, and Confucianism are quoted way more in old books than Shinto is
[04:12:07] <hihospaghettio> I look chinese, but I'm huge comparitively
[04:12:25] <DawnBatGuano> Hrafnbjorn: Taoism <3
[04:12:33] <hihospaghettio> ask any chinese and they will say thats because all japanese stories came from china, as did the japanese culture, lol
[04:12:40] <DawnBatGuano> Confucianism seems way more complex than Taoism though
[04:12:59] <DawnBatGuano> hihospaghettio: http://imgur.com/5ADCeuF A terrible view of the Shade Palace
[04:13:01] <hihospaghettio> not really
[04:13:03] <Hrafnbjorn> the Japanese say that too... except up by Hokkaido
[04:14:05] <hihospaghettio> filial piety, humanity and ritual, thats bout all there is to it
[04:14:25] <hihospaghettio> nice dawn!
[04:14:45] <Hrafnbjorn> the indigenous Japanese culture is most closely related to Siberian, and Native American, so up by Hokkaido, where there are still a lot of Ainu, they dont trace their culture to China

[05:38:38] <SpiritSong> they have an intranet system
[05:38:46] <SpiritSong> rather than internet
[05:38:51] <Keith>  which is why i said not now
[05:38:54] <SpiritSong> nothing from outside korea
[05:39:08] <CantSirDraggin_> without knowing the fail safes that may be in place, and i would not often say this, but that is a place where a fairly large number of assassinations need to happen in quick succession

[05:40:30] * SpiritSong notes it this timelol
[05:40:30] <Keith> same here SpiritSong :)
[05:40:58] <CantSirDraggin_> there's a power structure south and west of them ready to take that void up
[05:41:18] <CantSirDraggin_> where the new lines were drawn would be the complicated part
[05:41:24] <SpiritSong> hehe keith
[05:41:25] <Keith> now now CantSirDraggin_...they cant be all that bad
[05:41:53] <Hrafnbjorn> that is the reason western powers have always failed in the mid east... they think putting puppets in power helps, but it doesnt
[05:42:03] <CantSirDraggin_> i didn't say level the entire place
[05:42:34] <CantSirDraggin_> the s. koreans and the chinese would take over pretty fast
[05:42:56] <Hrafnbjorn> the only way to change that regime is by the pupolace to want it, without that any outside leadership will never work
[05:43:15] <CantSirDraggin_> would have to be a lot public and fast to get the n. korean peeps in on that it's ok 
[05:43:29] <CantSirDraggin_> the populace is clearly cowed

[05:45:07] <CantSirDraggin_> i'm basing it on reason
[05:45:22] <Hrafnbjorn> if it were easy to simply replace leadership, the USSR would have never been what it was
[05:46:02] <CantSirDraggin_> smaller scale, and not capable of mutual destruction yet
[05:47:20] <CantSirDraggin_> also, too much to do too fast for it not to be a near total war scenario though, assuming they have enough weapons to hand out
[05:48:07] <CantSirDraggin_> but the alternative is to wait for them to become a nuclear power
[05:48:07] <Hrafnbjorn> the change will eventualy come to N.Korea, spies are hard at work to change things, and families are now able to communicate back and forth... change to a State is slow though
[05:50:30] <Hrafnbjorn> N Korea isnt the military force polititians like to pretend... they just look at numbrs and rhetoric, but since none of them are trained in strategy they fail to see that RPK cannot even handle the atrition of existing, for them to wage war they would not be able to get much farther than ROK before they start to starve

[06:23:25] <Iona> Ouch

[06:24:56] <Hrafnbjorn> if you are having migraines you might have to try to stay away from many teas... and I know ya like tea
[06:25:12] <Keith> i can suffer then :)
[06:25:30] <Keith> but they are very brief
[06:25:56] <CantSirDraggin_> got it, ty Keith
[06:26:00] <Keith> oddly enough they started right after i actually got practicing magic.... possibly a coincidence
[06:26:09] <Keith> you're welcome CantSirDraggin_
[06:26:13] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Perhaps chamomile would help?
[06:26:14] <Hrafnbjorn> I am glad that I dont have the type triggered by tannins, so I dnt have to worry about tea
[06:26:52] <Keith> they last maybe 10 seconds
[06:27:06] <Hrafnbjorn> oh, not migraines then
[06:27:24] <Keith> nope
[06:27:37] <SnakeEyes> Some people who suffer from migraines take a few teaspoons of olive oil everyday for the anti-inflammatory properties.
[06:27:57] <Keith> once in a while i once in a while get them in the torso as well..... can be hard to breath
[06:28:41] <Hrafnbjorn> have you had problems with blood clots?
[06:28:50] <Keith> not to my knowledge.

[06:31:07] <Keith> lol
[06:31:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It's like this every year, the weather goes up and down like a roller coaster for about a month.
[06:31:32] <CantSirDraggin_> here too, then dead on hot
[06:31:43] <CantSirDraggin_> also, tornadoes
[06:31:55] <CantSirDraggin_> in the flux period, mostly
[06:31:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Might even be the middle of May before it settles out.

[06:35:39] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yup, that's better than out on the Great Plains, where their really is no windbreak.

[22:23:57] <Keith> I am ever so grateful to the mother earth for everything she has granted :)
[22:24:34] <Keith> magic is a manipulation of energy at varying frequencies using the elements, to gain a desired effect
[22:25:17] <Mim> I agree
[22:25:36] <Keith> yet I dont call myself a witch because I dont like titles
[22:25:58] <Mim> can't imagine why not! ;) j/k 
[22:26:52] <Keith> just like I dont like being called sir, Mister.  i find them to be placing a person above another.   even within religions i dont like titles
[22:27:51] <Keith> we are all people just trying to survive in this world... we dont need titles, need cooperation
[22:28:22] <Keith> hence my mockery title i give myself if someone throws theirs around :)

[22:30:24] <Mim> to have those "it's not just me!" moment
[22:30:37] <Keith> oh i identify with most of you.... we all practice magic in our own ways.
[22:30:46] <Keith> like i dont use tools
[22:31:07] <Keith> some people use an athame and candles
[22:31:13] <Keith> not really my thing
[22:31:20] <Mim> do you just use your mind
[22:31:42] <Keith> yes.  so you could say i am psychic
[22:32:03] <Keith> if i use some chant it is in my mind
[22:32:59] <Mim> that would be a label you're comfortable with?
[22:33:19] <Keith> if i use one it is an energy weaver
