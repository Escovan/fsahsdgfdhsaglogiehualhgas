[11:17:52] <June> mm
[11:17:58] <fsdfwewew> hi june
[11:18:06] <June> took me ages to find this site again
[11:18:11] <Keith> howdy June
[11:18:11] <June> what's happened?
[11:18:20] <Keith> the original site got hacked
[11:18:23] <June> hey there fsd and Keith
[11:18:35] <June> that's bloody evil
[11:18:43] <June> must be a threat to someone
[11:18:50] <Keith> yup... so it is slowly being worked on by peeps
[11:18:58] <Keith> or someone was just bored
[11:19:08] <June> that's malicious intent
[11:19:31] <Keith> malicious is usually directed at someone or something isn't it?? not just random?
[11:19:50] <June> i doubt the hacker was just random
[11:20:33] <Keith> for me, anything is possible
[11:20:45] <June> even if it was, to mess up someone's work is malicious and intended
[11:21:00] <fsdfwewew> which site is hacked
[11:21:09] <fsdfwewew> I am here from irc lc (kiwi irc)
[11:21:30] <Keith> the main site for this page altfaiths.com
[11:21:41] <fsdfwewew> ah ok
[11:22:18] <fsdfwewew> there is left no more site for witche
[11:22:19] <Keith> looked up the definition of malicious......
[11:22:19] <June> if i randomly hack your site and mess up your work, no matter who you are, i intended to harm you, even if i did not know you
[11:22:23] <Keith> yer right June :)
[11:22:37] <fsdfwewew> all got closed or there is no active users on it
[11:22:56] <June> thats so ugly i have no words
[11:24:10] <Keith> it could have been worse
[11:24:30] <June> this is bad enuf for me
[11:24:50] <Keith> how have you been
[11:25:22] <June> i'm ok, just really pissed off finding out that i couldn't access witches in the normal manner
[11:25:25] <Keith> fsdfwewew, perhaps the girl you told that you loved just doesnt feel the same way about you
[11:25:50] <Keith> that is why it is nice to have friends on fb who can help out
[11:26:06] <fsdfwewew> yes  she said on skype that she doesn't love me and don't want to marry me just chat to me
[11:26:21] <fsdfwewew> oh I don't have much people on fb
[11:26:22] <fsdfwewew> :)
[11:27:01] <fsdfwewew> she even say that she want to marry someone else
[11:27:12] <fsdfwewew> and when she get married she will still talking to me on skype
[11:27:17] <June> salt in the wound
[11:27:20] <fsdfwewew> that was freaking me out
[11:27:26] <fsdfwewew> :)
[11:27:40] <Keith> love can be a fickle thing
[11:27:58] <Keith> ....... to get it, or not to get it
[11:28:49] <fsdfwewew> she even blocked me on skye
[11:28:56] <fsdfwewew> I say sorry to her many times
[11:29:00] <fsdfwewew> she don't reacted
[11:29:02] <fsdfwewew> :)
[11:29:52] <June> so its ppl who are fickle not love
[11:30:58] <Keith> love can be as well.
[11:31:17] <fsdfwewew> also she talking to some other dude and he give him her phone number, she don't give to me her phone number she lie that she don't have phone
[11:31:18] <June> how so? love is simple it is the people who complicate it
[11:31:43] <Keith> well... i guess it can be lust as well
[11:32:04] <June> again that is down to the man or woman behind the lust
[11:32:31] <fsdfwewew> i cannot get lust from her she look very serious
[11:32:33] <fsdfwewew> :)
[11:32:39] <June> lol

[11:34:21] <fsdfwewew> and she come again in skype for 5-10 min but she left without saying a single word

[11:34:52] <fsdfwewew> even stopped to talking to me in person
[11:34:53] <Keith> ok...

[12:48:43] <fsdfwewew> and i say to him can you pray over me to get a gf
[12:49:07] <fsdfwewew> and my cousin told him in secretly to not pray over me for marriage
[12:49:10] <Keith> ok
[12:49:28] <fsdfwewew> then he say to me do you want to marry this girl and i say yes i want
[12:49:44] <Keith> take your time and try to find the right person.
[12:49:55] <Keith> and god won't do anything for you that you wont do for yourself
[12:50:17] <Keith> so if you want help finding a girlfriend, start looking yourself
[12:50:19] <fsdfwewew> and then he opened his book incidentally to the place where it is written for marriage and he pray to me to marry this girl
[12:50:37] <fsdfwewew> yes
[12:50:45] <fsdfwewew> all my life i was trying to find a girlfriend
[12:50:49] <fsdfwewew> and i pray to God for this
[12:50:55] <fsdfwewew> but he don't give me gf
[12:50:58] <fsdfwewew> ....
[12:51:28] <fsdfwewew> then i start making good things and i dream that i walk with one girl in big darkness to another big darkness
[12:51:42] <fsdfwewew> and after time i finded one girl from Indonesia but now i am alone again
[12:51:43] <fsdfwewew> :)
[12:55:06] <Keith> dont be in such a hurry.  you got lots of years ahead of you
[12:55:13] <fsdfwewew> oh Keith
[12:55:18] <fsdfwewew> i am already judged
[12:55:20] <fsdfwewew> to be killed
[12:55:24] <fsdfwewew> in a few years
[12:55:29] <fsdfwewew> because of one mason
[12:55:38] <fsdfwewew> so i don't have much time
[12:55:55] <fsdfwewew> also evil powers try to make my life worst
[12:56:03] <fsdfwewew> no matter it is only a few years left
[12:56:13] <fsdfwewew> that's why satan try to save my life but to get my soul
[12:56:18] <fsdfwewew> but i deny because i go to church
[12:56:20] <fsdfwewew> :)
[12:56:42] <Keith> live each day as its own.... dont let what one man says guide your course
[12:57:29] <Keith> it is having a negative mindset that will make your life hell. not what others have said
[12:58:44] <June> true keith
[12:58:46] <fsdfwewew> yes
[12:58:52] <fsdfwewew> i wanted to not say this to her
[12:59:03] <fsdfwewew> my mother say don't say this to her she will stop talking to you
[12:59:08] <June> and no one good would tell a man that he has only a few years to live
[12:59:19] <fsdfwewew> but i accepted this priest as a saint and i was thinking everything who he says is good
[12:59:23] <fsdfwewew> and must be say
[12:59:24] <fsdfwewew> and i wrong

[20:20:09] <AryRhr> Arch isnt really my type, apt-get is OK

[20:20:56] <AryRhr> i5 here
[20:21:01] <AryRhr> oops
[20:21:09] <Iona> FreeBSD does have a different shell and environment...  if you want security, check out OpenBSD

[20:21:41] <ExTaZyTi> ha no
[20:21:42] <ExTaZyTi> openbsd
[20:21:44] <AryRhr> its just more commands to memorize, and my memory isnt the best anyway
[20:21:51] <ExTaZyTi> is not so good
[20:22:29] <Iona> That's true; it does take a long time to get up to speed with the command line; it helps that many of the commands are mnemonic

[22:23:28] <North> awesome   :)
[22:23:36] <Witchit> How are you? We're talking about my art commissions ^ ^
[22:24:07] <H-> Art!, I love art, too bad I can't do art mysel :o)
[22:24:15] <H-> I tried, I failed, I tried again, I failed harder
[22:24:30] <H-> doing fine though
[22:25:32] <Witchit> Cool :) I'm sure no one is truly bad at art...we put ourselves down because we try to compare ourselves to realism or some 'genius' art style that really is just another point of view
[22:25:51] <H-> fair point
[22:26:06] <H-> maybe im just a bit of a perfectionist then, my drawings are never good enough
[22:27:08] <Witchit> Yeah, I get that way too, especially when I'm surrounded by a lot of artists every day in class. But then I just think that even the masters had masters
[22:27:34] <H-> oh yeah
[22:27:51] <Witchit> There's no such thing as bad art, because we all have different voices
[22:27:56] <H-> I have that with musicians, I always thing * well.. I'd better not play anything because these guys will laugh at me*
[22:28:09] <H-> think*
[22:28:22] <H-> excuse the typos, I may have had a wee amount of beer
[22:28:25] <Witchit> That's a class A perfectionist right there :P
[22:28:31] <Witchit> And that's k
[22:29:18] <H-> seeing as it's  kingsday tomorrow in the netherlands (birthday of the king gets celebrated), it's a legit excuse to get smashed tonight :P
[22:29:34] <Witchit> Heheheheh
[22:29:47] <Witchit> I was about to say 'just don't go too overboard'
[22:29:59] <H-> :D
[22:30:05] <H-> good thing I know my limits
[22:30:10] <Witchit> In your case, go nuts. Just not too nuts ;)
[22:30:21] <Witchit> I'm glad you do
[22:30:29] <H-> a good thing I found out, the very few times I do get drunk I simply get very cudly with my girlfriend and then fall asleep :P
[22:30:35] <Witchit> Awwww
[22:30:54] <H-> I prefer that to some guys I know, they smash things to pieces when they're drunk
[22:31:00] <Witchit> It's good you're not angry or sad or emotional in those times
[22:31:04] <H-> I'd  quit drinking instantly if that were ever to happen
[22:31:26] <Witchit> For me, if I ever drank alcohol my doctor tells me I'd die
[22:31:30] <Witchit> I'd literally die o3o
[22:31:32] <H-> oof
[22:31:43] <Witchit> My medication converts it to poison
[22:31:51] <H-> yeah, my girlfriend has that too
[22:32:01] <H-> she can drink a little bit though
[22:32:08] <H-> she harldy ever does
[22:32:11] <H-> hardly
[22:32:43] <Witchit> I never drink. Ever. The same goes for coffee.
[22:32:54] <Witchit> I can drink coffee
[22:32:55] <H-> I don't  do coffee either
[22:33:01] <Witchit> Yeah
[22:33:08] <Witchit> Eeeeeuuuughhh the taste > <
[22:33:32] <H-> I somehow go insane if I don't drink (don't  get me wrong, I drink in the weekends normally, today is an exception) but I end up thinking and thinking and driving myself mad, alcohol numbs the mind
[22:34:06] <H-> it's my easy way out
[22:34:24] <Witchit> Are you an alcoholic then? You don't need to answer that if you don't want to.
[22:34:31] <H-> I'm not addicted though :P I have had many times that I quit drinking for a year or so
[22:34:40] <Witchit> Oh, okay
[22:34:44] <H-> not to worry ;)
[22:35:01] <Witchit> Good, I'm glad :)
[22:35:50] <Witchit> There's some scary people I've met with personal experience who have drank so much they've wrecked their bodies
[22:36:19] <Witchit> I really hate seeing it in action 0_o
[22:37:12] <H-> yes
[22:37:23] <H-> family members have it, they ended up in mental institutions
[22:37:34] <H-> very good example of how not to end up
[22:37:50] <H-> hence my not drinking for a year periods, I know what it will do to the mind
[22:38:30] <H-> I usually drink about 4 to 5 glasses of beer in the weekend, that will do for me, rest of the week I'm sober

[22:44:28] <Witchit> DAMNIT I JUST GOT RICKROLLED
[22:44:35] <H-> hahaha  :D
[22:44:49] <Witchit> Oh my god I haven't been rickrolled in so long XD
[22:47:35] <H-> by the way, speaking of witches, how did you guys get in touch with others? here in the netherlands it's very hard to find like minded people.. I can tell when someone's a witch but they never want to talk about it
[22:47:55] <H-> they just give me some big eyed stare and leave
[22:48:07] <H-> before the usual *how did you know*
[22:49:45] <Witchit> That's the thing, I don't know any other witches in my area
[22:50:01] <H-> hah :D
[22:50:19] <Witchit> I only know them online, but I do get accepted in college
[22:50:30] <Witchit> And for some reason, ONLY in college and slightly at home
[22:50:32] <H-> though I wouldn't call myself a witch, I'm just looking for an open mind
[22:50:46] <Witchit> What religion are you H-? :)
[22:51:15] <H-> hmm.. hard to describe.. i'm into the whole, everything is one and one is part of the everything, good and bad do not exist, it's merely a choice
[22:51:53] <Witchit> Interesting...
[22:51:55] <H-> my case is a bit weird, seeing *people* where others did not from a very young age
[22:52:19] <H-> I thought I went mad, untill I met someone that described the exact same person I saw without even talking to het about it
[22:52:31] <H-> het=her
[22:52:34] <Witchit> Oh..I think I know what you're talking about
[22:53:05] <H-> it's how I can tell that other people see them aswell etc, that people are witches for example.. I just feel it
[22:53:22] <H-> I can finish sentences of people when they only said one word
[22:53:28] <H-> it comes naturally
[22:53:46] <Witchit> I can do a pretty good divination session, as well as have prophetic dreams for myself, other people, and even people from another life
[22:54:30] <Witchit> It's something I believe is a calling to help other spirits
[22:55:20] <Witchit> I am not you, but I know there are people out there like you :)
[22:55:26] <H-> hmm, I see aura's too, not always though
[22:56:10] <Witchit> Well, not exactly auras. But I do see figures
[22:56:20] <Witchit> Almost like shadow people
[22:57:16] <H-> healing healing with warmth from the hands, don't ask me how it works, it just works
[22:57:32] <H-> I can burn peolpe too, I found out by accident, I dont want that
[22:57:38] <H-> so never gonna happen again
[22:57:52] <H-> shadow people ?
[22:58:07] <Witchit> Yeah....not shadows...like, 3D shadows
[22:58:15] <H-> hmm..
[22:58:23] <Witchit> Spirits can take that form
[22:58:49] <H-> I only see that in the minds eye, if that makes sense
[22:58:57] <Witchit> Nah, I gotcha :)
[22:59:00] <H-> and instantly know what the entity is and it's past etc
[22:59:12] <Witchit> I don't, so it takes longer for me
[22:59:19] <H-> emotions, that's the first thing I pick up, sadness or happyness
[22:59:32] <Witchit> I pick up emotions too, but that's it
[22:59:43] <Witchit> You must be really talented H- ^ ^

[23:00:04] <H-> It's best describes as remembring a face, think of a face, that image is what I see with a big backgound story attached
[23:00:30] <Witchit> That's really cool!
[23:00:43] <H-> well it used to freak me out a lot, specially at a young age.. parents not understanding me etc
[23:00:47] <H-> no one seeing what I saw
[23:01:48] <H-> I learned to face my fears though, I had some guidence in dreams.. the same dream repeating over and over untill I got the point, always the same person teaching me in my dreams, continuing the next day
[23:02:03] <H-> very strange
[23:02:50] <Iona> why is it strange, H-?  
[23:02:56] <H-> the follow up dreams
[23:03:00] <H-> the teaching
[23:03:04] <H-> and it actually working
[23:03:06] <Iona> it's not strange
[23:03:10] <H-> to me it was ;)
[23:03:22] <Witchit> I dream every night :) My most famous dream is my mansion dream...a dream series that lasted through a month that told the story of a mansion owner
[23:03:28] <Iona> "strange" is a label we put on an experience, because we erroneously think it "shouldn't" happen
[23:03:43] <Iona> change the label, change the experience.
[23:03:49] <H-> yeah very true
[23:03:57] <Witchit> I met Erik face to face in my dreams, later doing research the next day
[23:04:21] <Witchit> I even got pictures of the mansion and the biography, which all turned out to be legitimate
[23:04:33] <H-> I also do lucid dreaming a lot, It allows me to dream with crystal clear vision somehow, and remember my dreams
[23:04:35] <Witchit> I had known a person I had never even met
[23:04:45] <H-> yeah
[23:04:52] <H-> we're all connected Witchit 
[23:05:02] <H-> it's about time mankind learned that
[23:05:03] <H-> all is one ;)
[23:05:58] <Witchit> I think you'd like Carl Jung...he's a psychologist who taught about everyone's minds being connected...almost like a network
[23:06:22] <H-> that's exacly what I mean o.O
[23:06:32] <H-> I'll google that name then :o)
[23:07:38] <H-> think of it as a shattered glass, a huge amoutn of pieces, still the same glass, still one
[23:07:41] <H-> if it makes sense
[23:07:56] <Witchit> He also talked about archetypes
[23:07:59] <H-> a fractal, 
[23:08:08] <Witchit> How there's the hero, the mother, etc.
[23:08:20] <Witchit> He also loved tarot ;)
[23:08:45] <H-> tarot yes, I still need to learn about that, my girlfriend does it too
[23:09:59] <Witchit> Tarot is a lot of fun, and a good divination tool
[23:10:06] <Witchit> That's why I want to expand with runes
[23:10:18] <Witchit> (If you know anything about runes, I want to try it)
[23:10:36] <H-> hmm.. no not really sadly
[23:10:49] <H-> I know a weebit of theban runes, if they even are runes :P
[23:11:31] <H-> it's one of the strange things about me, I can't focus on materialistic things
[23:11:46] <Witchit> That's cool, no one really needs to :P
[23:11:52] <H-> anyway, I'm off for now, I', headed to the pub :)
[23:11:56] <H-> cya
