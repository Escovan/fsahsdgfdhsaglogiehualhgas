[01:46:11] <raevynskyyemt> especially street lighting

[01:46:25] <raevynskyyemt> the houses are all lit up, but the streets are dark 
[01:46:34] <raevynskyyemt> well, mostly lit up. i ran out of copper
[01:46:40] <Keith> so you make your own settlement?
[01:47:00] <raevynskyyemt> there are two types. settlements with homes, and settlements without homes
[01:47:04] <raevynskyyemt> in both you can build new homes
[01:47:10] <Keith> lol
[01:47:24] <raevynskyyemt> i suspect minecrafts popularity is to blame for this :p
[01:47:35] <Keith> minecraft is pretty fun... i play that one
[01:47:52] <raevynskyyemt> i play it, too. it's lacking something i can't quite place to make it really fun for me
[01:48:05] <Keith> the roleplaying aspect?

[06:52:58] <Keith> how was your weekend SpiritSong
[06:53:05] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Could have been better, Keith
[06:53:19] <Keith> crappy weather??
[06:53:28] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Least of it
[06:53:30] * SpiritSong hugs archy
[06:53:41] <MissSugar> hey ArchrWndrMcRbrt 
[06:53:42] <Keith> sorry to hear it went so crappy
[06:53:52] <SpiritSong> it was nice, how was yours?
[06:54:03] <SpiritSong> what happened archy
[06:54:11] <SpiritSong> did you get your pension yet
[06:54:32] <Keith> pretty fun over all...... except for the sleeping
[06:54:43] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yes, SpiritSong. That got sorted on Friday
[06:54:55] <SpiritSong> good
[06:55:08] <SpiritSong> sleeping does tend to be toned down
[06:55:09] <Keith> good to hear ArchrWndrMcRbrt
[06:55:10] <SpiritSong> :P
[06:55:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And then, very early yeasterday morning, the son of a friend killed himself
[06:55:46] <MissSugar> thats awful
[06:56:03] <Keith> so sorry to hear it ArchrWndrMcRbrt.
[06:56:14] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And, as he was falling to the floor, the gun went off again, and shot her in the foot
[06:56:37] <Keith> wow...... that is just horrible
[06:56:55] <SpiritSong> im so sorry to hear that :(
[06:57:00] <SpiritSong> thats so awful
[06:57:03] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> I'm sorry to hear that
[06:57:05] <SpiritSong> :(
[06:57:23] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> We're all gonna be keeping an eye out for a while, to be sure she gets through it
[06:57:44] <SpiritSong> yeah, she's going to need a lot of support
[06:58:30] <SpiritSong> poor lady, that's heartbreaking
[06:59:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Apparently, he was trying to teach her how to use a gun, as she got mugged outside the polling place last Tuesday, and she said, "It doesn't matter." And he replied, "It doesn't now", and then did that. He had been drinking, so it was probably a bad time to do that.
[06:59:29] <Keith> i'll be wishing for strength for the family
[07:00:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Thank you. Our whole community is doing that, and extra energy should help.
[07:00:20] <SpiritSong> ill light some candles too
[07:00:41] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Thanks, lass.
[07:00:45] <SpiritSong> that kind of thing needs the whole communities support, even it its indirectt
[07:00:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yup
[07:01:54] <SpiritSong> <3
[07:02:02] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> <3
[07:02:20] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> So, did you get Spring yet, lass?
[07:02:43] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Still waiting, here. Supposed to get to the 40's and 50's this week.
[07:03:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Hoping it gets nice before Beltane.
[07:03:30] <SpiritSong> its starting to peep out from behind the clouds but it got shy and ran back in yesterday, and jack frost came out
[07:03:45] <SpiritSong> a sunny beltane would be nice :)
[07:04:05] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yikes
[07:04:51] <SpiritSong> ikr
[07:05:00] <SpiritSong> what have you planned for beltane
[07:07:36] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> We have a festival on the 1st, in fact. Always nice to be able to actually celebrate on the Sabbat itself.
[07:08:32] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> 4 workshops, a ritual and a Maypole Dance
[07:08:37] <SpiritSong> nice!!!!
[07:08:44] <SpiritSong> that sounds so much fun
[07:09:31] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Aspects of Astrology, Angel Magic, Witchcraft 101 and Palmistry
[07:10:20] <SpiritSong> that sounds exciting  ^_^
[07:10:31] <SpiritSong> its socool there is festivals near you
[07:10:31] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The Palmistry workshop is being done by the Priestess who is conducting the ritual.
[07:10:46] <SpiritSong> nice :P)
[07:10:54] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yeah, we have two groups here that do them
[07:11:37] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Our Pagan Unity Council, and one called Fellowship of Alernative Beliefs
[07:12:05] <SpiritSong> do thry get together to organise bigger events
[07:12:27] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Not at present, but who knows what the future holds?
[07:14:13] <SpiritSong> could have some pretty big events if that was the case
[07:14:47] <SpiritSong> i dont think anything much is going on here
[07:15:02] <SpiritSong> except for a drumming cirlce, which is monthly anyways
[07:15:12] <SpiritSong> but i dont have transport there
[07:15:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, it also depends on the size of the community, and how well the word is gotten out.
[07:16:14] <SpiritSong> thats true
[07:16:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Oh, yeah. There are a lot of solitary folk in the smaller towns who can't get to stuff like that
[07:17:36] <SpiritSong> prolly why they are solitary
[07:17:37] <SpiritSong> lol

[07:33:08] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> Started cleaning an apartment
[07:33:12] <BansheeTears> Ya don't realize how much ya use the outer till your stuck with daytime tv
[07:33:25] <BansheeTears> All those judge shows...
[07:33:29] <SpiritSong> http://www.alandart.co.uk/product/all-patterns/artie-the-artist/      im making this lil guy
[07:33:33] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> Outer? 
[07:33:41] <BansheeTears> I used to clean apts too
[07:33:48] <BansheeTears> Computer
[07:33:48] <SpiritSong> omg judge judy
[07:33:48] <MissSugar> i got an email from kasamba saying if i didnt get a client in 6 days they are going to shut down my profile, and the minute i turned it on some woman contacted me asking if they would be together forever
[07:33:51] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> Oh
[07:33:53] <MissSugar> i asked are you together now
[07:33:56] <MissSugar> she said no
[07:34:09] <BansheeTears> Nice!!
[07:34:18] <MissSugar> heres your sign
[07:34:37] <BansheeTears> Nothing like instant confirmation
[07:34:44] <SpiritSong> lmao
[07:35:17] <BansheeTears> raevynskyyemt: we're they smokers?
[07:35:33] <BansheeTears> That nicotine on the walls is a bugger
[07:35:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> So, she wanted to know if she would be forever together with someone she isn't with, yet?
[07:36:01] <MissSugar> no they broke up
[07:36:05] <MissSugar> like 4 months ago
[07:36:10] <Keith> wanna know what works good for getting rid of stains on walls?
[07:36:14] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> No. But they did have dogs
[07:36:20] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> Hair everywhere 
[07:36:20] <BansheeTears> What?
[07:36:21] * ArchrWndrMcRbrt facepalms
[07:36:27] <MissSugar> what am i suppose to say to that shit?
[07:36:34] <BansheeTears> Oh dang... Dog hair
[07:36:40] <Keith> spray nine.... a strong cleaner... cuts grease and everything
[07:37:03] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> I'll have to look into that
[07:37:05] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I wish I had an idea, MissSugar. But, I'm at a loss on this one.
[07:37:06] <Keith> can get it at a hardware store, and places like that. maybe even walmart
[07:37:07] <BansheeTears> Well her chances don't look favorable
[07:37:17] <SpiritSong> poor lady
[07:37:28] <SpiritSong> hope she accepts it an moves on soon
[07:37:33] <SpiritSong> save herself some pain
[07:37:34] <BansheeTears> I. Use la's totally awesome cleaner
[07:37:50] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Sounds like a case where shaking a Magic 8-Ball would be as good as anything.
[07:37:51] <BansheeTears> It gets the nicotine off easy
[07:38:08] <BansheeTears> But it's not as good at degreasing
[07:38:13] <MissSugar> i hope so too, but the amount of women asking if they and someone else will be together forever which by the way is a damn long time after they have broken up is ridiculous 
[07:38:29] <Keith> dad uses it all the time when working on car partts and stuffs
[07:38:29] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I agree
[07:38:35] <BansheeTears> I'll look for the spray nine in as
[07:38:40] <BansheeTears> Az
[07:38:43] <raevynskyyemt_alt1> We don't allow smoking in here
[07:39:29] <BansheeTears> It's sad MissSugar ... I'm too honest sometimes
[07:39:36] <BansheeTears> I be like.  Nope
[07:39:40] <MissSugar> i am trying to be empathetic but man dont make people a priority in your life when the couldnt care less about you, be with someone who is just as exited to see you as you are them
[07:39:47] <SpiritSong> honest is good
[07:39:59] <BansheeTears> So true MissSugar
[07:39:59] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I agree, MissSugar
[07:40:00] <SpiritSong> exactly MissSugar
[07:40:44] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> When you get home, and the reaction is, "Oh, it's you.", it might be time to move on.
[07:40:48] <BansheeTears> Sometimes it's best to feel your pain and move on

[15:32:27] <Escovan> The salesman and the system analyst took off to spend a weekend in the forest, hunting bear. They'd rented a cabin, and, when they got there, took their backpacks off and put them inside. At which point the salesman turned to his friend, and said, "You unpack while I go and find us a bear." Puzzled, the analyst finished unpacking and then went and sat down on the porch. Soon he could hear rustling noises in the forest. The noises got nearer 
[15:32:27] <Escovan> -- and louder -- and suddenly there was the salesman, running like hell across the clearing toward the cabin, pursued by one of the largest and most ferocious grizzly bears the analyst had ever seen. "Open the door!", screamed the salesman. The analyst whipped open the door, and the salesman ran to the door, suddenly stopped, and stepped aside. The bear, unable to stop, continued through the door and into the cabin. The salesman slammed the 
[15:32:28] <Escovan> door closed and grinned at his friend. "Got him!", he exclaimed, "now, you skin this one and I'll go rustle us up another!"

[19:54:18] <Keith> awesome, thanks Witchit :)
[19:54:57] <Witchit> Can you remind me about the dimensions though? I think the problem is the size, but maybe I wrote it down wrong
[19:55:06] <Witchit> Thank you SpiritSong!

[19:55:51] <Witchit> OOHHHHH
[19:55:57] <Witchit> That's why T^T
[19:56:03] <Witchit> Thanks for telling me
[19:56:13] <Witchit> I wrote down 2300x1400 for some reason

[19:57:05] <Keith> kk :)
[19:57:22] <Keith> so what exactly is an art therapist?
[19:58:03] <Witchit> So think of it like a psychologist who, instead of sitting down and talking, relaxes you by giving you art projects
[19:58:14] <Witchit> No due date, no grades, just fun :)
[19:58:38] <Keith> ohhh ok

[20:01:48] <SpiritSong> i really do agree though

[20:02:29] <tomorrowgirl> hi

[20:03:17] <Witchit> I'd understand because I have schizophrenia and anxiety and depression and other stuff
[20:03:23] <Witchit> But it was really scary
[20:03:45] <Witchit> Especially since that might have ruined my life if I didn't get it changed
[20:05:21] <Witchit> Keith, check your Facebook for your tattoo :)
[20:05:33] <SpiritSong> did she even offer you support in coming to terms with the diagnosis?
[20:06:07] <Witchit> She did, but I don't appreciate what she said in terms to that
[20:06:15] <Witchit> The same thing happened with my boyfriend
[20:06:27] <Witchit> Like, the same diagnosis that he was 'psychotic'
[20:07:07] <Witchit> It was only because he was labeled with Aspergers
[20:07:28] <Witchit> I was so confused because she also never told him a thing about it
[20:08:12] <SpiritSong> she sounds unprofessional
[20:09:53] <Witchit> Yeah...it was probably because he doesn't have enough money for a real one...the government paid for her
[20:09:55] <Witchit> *him
[20:10:45] <Keith> yay it worked.... woohooo
[20:11:08] <Keith> thanks again Witchit :)

[20:15:27] <SpiritSong> what did ye havr to do to get yours dianososs changes Witchit
[20:17:04] <Witchit> I'm unsure, because I was very young at the time, but my parents had to convince the psychologist by word, and even threatened to sue because it was like my first visit and she gave me the diagnosis right away like 30 minutes in, also treating me pretty badly
[20:17:25] <Witchit> At the time I think I was in 2nd grade
[20:17:48] <Witchit> My boyfriend actually had to move psychologists to convince the next one to change his
[20:19:11] <SpiritSong> uh 30 mins in,,,thats effen nuts
[20:19:54] <Witchit> That's pretty much the same with my boyfriend, but he was diagnosed an hour in
[20:20:04] * SpiritSong tuts
[20:20:10] <SpiritSong> im sorry ye had to go through that...
[20:20:14] <SpiritSong> that sucks

[20:22:55] <SpiritSong> im glad they changed it for him though
[20:23:00] <Witchit> I guess...but what scared me was that she never told him
[20:23:20] <Witchit> She's like "I think he's psychotic, so I'll write it down and keep it a secret
[20:23:46] * SpiritSong shudders
[20:23:55] <SpiritSong> how did he find out
[20:24:17] <Witchit> So he was passing by the psychologist and saw it on her paper
[20:25:51] <Witchit> She didn't exactly leave it in the open, but she was in her chair and he was walking around her
[20:27:00] <SpiritSong> ahhh, he said it to her then?
[20:28:19] <SpiritSong> there is nothing to be ashamed of if you do suffer from psychosis/are psychotic. but getting the wrongg diagnosis is distressing
[20:28:50] <Witchit> No, he is not psychotic though, that is the completely wrong diagnosis
[20:28:58] <SpiritSong> oh i know
[20:29:14] <SpiritSong> im just making it clear its nothing shameful
[20:29:42] <Witchit> I understand that, and thank you for pointing that out. I just find it completely stupid that they're diagnosing him to get more money
[20:30:51] <Witchit> He attempted to talk to her over the phone, but she said she was always too 'busy' to talk. After that, he asked to have a session with her to clear this up, but it was too late because he gave up to switch psychologists
[20:31:27] <North> <-- psleepchotic
[20:31:30] <Witchit> Since the government pays for his psychologist, he often has to switch
