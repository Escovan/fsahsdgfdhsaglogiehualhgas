[04:02:42] <DawnBat> I made dinner surprisingly
[04:03:31] <DawnBat> who likes asian food?
[04:04:07] <Hrafnbjorn> depends on what it is
[04:04:31] <Hrafnbjorn> rice, of course.... rotten eggs, hels no
[04:05:04] <DawnBat> It's pork chowmein with rice noodles
[04:05:32] <Hrafnbjorn> all good stuff :)
[04:05:41] <DawnBat> I just kinda randomly threw stuff together
[04:06:14] <Hrafnbjorn> do you have Mongolian BBQ's there?
[04:06:23] <DawnBat> I do
[04:06:24] <DawnBat> HuHot
[04:06:34] <Hrafnbjorn> love that stuff, lol
[04:07:03] <DawnBat> it's more noodle then meal xD
[04:07:03] <Hrafnbjorn> there are not any in the town I live in, so I make a point of going to one whenever I am outa town
[04:07:51] <DawnBat> Like it's 3 parts noodle and half part suasage/halfpart sauce
[04:07:58] <Hrafnbjorn> its however ya make it, at least here... ya get a bowel, put the stuff ya want in it, then they cook it, so you could make it 50% flesh, or whatever
[04:08:14] <DawnBat> that's a fun word
[04:08:19] <DawnBat> "flesh"
[04:08:36] <Hrafnbjorn> they usualy have beef, pork, chicken, turkey, and lamb in the ones here
[04:09:06] <DawnBat> lamb :3

[04:14:58] <Hrafnbjorn> do byou think it helps him?
[04:15:23] <DawnBat> I don't know realy, I don't think Doctors can seem to find an actual diagnosis. He's had so many from what I understand.
[04:15:41] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[04:16:05] <DawnBat> right now it's like Non-Verbal Learning Disorder
[04:16:58] <Hrafnbjorn> human psychology is one of the things that drives mathematicians crazy, because its one of the things a mathamatic perspective cant help with... so the whole clinical process often cant observe it, die to our chaotic mind
[04:17:11] <DawnBat> true true
[04:17:17] <DawnBat> I think I'm sick right now ><

[04:20:07] <DawnBat> Well
[04:20:13] <Erinn> Hai
[04:20:20] <DawnBat> Nukes are usually what coe to mind for me
[04:20:28] <Hrafnbjorn> I suppose it kinda depends if you judge success by nature or by mans ideals
[04:21:58] <Hrafnbjorn> by nature we are a huge success, by our own ideals (which will never be achieved) we are a more mild success.  Contrary to how the dramatics make it seem, we are less vilent overal today... just to give example
[04:22:06] <DawnBat> True
[04:22:22] <Hrafnbjorn> but we are still horribly violent, so baby stepps
[04:22:23] <DawnBat> Mankind will still kill the earth probably
[04:23:03] <Hrafnbjorn> ALL life destroys its environment.  We are just the thinking-ape, so we see how we are, plus we have greater ability to do so
[04:23:27] <DawnBat> True
[04:23:59] <Hrafnbjorn> that is the sacred balance between expanssion (living) and contraction (not living)
[04:24:11] <DawnBat> http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/jwb/PrimordialSoup.jpeg
[04:24:47] <Hrafnbjorn> as expasnssion expands,  it must consume both space to occupy, as well as energy (as food or fuel whatever) to make new material to expand with
[04:25:26] <DawnBat> should we move to mars?
[04:25:48] <Hrafnbjorn> lol, funny image
[04:25:56] <DawnBat> Yep
[04:27:02] <Hrafnbjorn> I think that we have to either find a way to migrate away form earth, or find a way to control population that isnt fascist... since the later is impossible, only way (at this point) that we can fond better harmony with our environs is to expand out/away
[04:27:18] <DawnBat> Yep
[04:27:27] <DawnBat> Venus would probably be a last resort
[04:27:31] <Hrafnbjorn> I wouod not want to be one to leave though
[04:27:32] <DawnBat> Titan and Mars might work
[04:27:44] <Hrafnbjorn> *would
[04:28:22] <North> Venus: a bit on the tropical side
[04:28:40] <North> if lead-melting temps can be considered tropical
[04:28:41] <DawnBat> but terraforming it would be the issue
[04:28:50] <DawnBat> the temps are due to the clouds I think
[04:29:02] <DawnBat> if the atmosphere is modified enough it might work
[04:30:35] <Hrafnbjorn> we would probably have to find a planet, or moon that had a similar electro-magnetic field as earth, otherwise the radiation we are not evolved to handle would kill us
[04:30:41] <DawnBat> Mars
[04:30:43] <DawnBat> ?
[04:30:55] <Hrafnbjorn> I think mars does, but I m not sure
[04:30:56] <DawnBat> Or we could do Domecities
[04:31:13] <DawnBat> I'm just tired of earth xD
[04:32:29] <DawnBat> Titian MIGHT work but that fart-moon status

[05:25:30] <BansheeTears> Take me with you
[05:25:31] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It's supposed to be Spring, feels like Winter, we should invent a 5th season, called Sprinter.

[05:27:33] <BansheeTears> North strikes me as a late fall early winter kind
[05:27:44] <BansheeTears> Roll tide!
[05:27:54] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Summer, BansheeTears. Definitely summer.
[05:28:03] <raevynskyyemt> In Montana it's normally winter. Followed by spring for a week. Then construction season. Then hunting. Then winter again 
[05:28:16] <BansheeTears> Lol
[05:28:40] <BansheeTears> We have dove hunting season
[05:28:43] <BansheeTears> That's it
[05:29:31] <raevynskyyemt> Our big seasons are bird migration and deer
[05:29:52] <BansheeTears> Do you hunt?
[05:29:52] <raevynskyyemt> Technically it's hunting season year round. But bear and such aren't popular

[05:56:11] <BansheeTears> About 8 dollars cheaper I think
[05:56:44] <raevynskyyemt> I was going to guess about 10%
[05:56:50] <raevynskyyemt> But I haven't done the math
[05:57:00] <BansheeTears> Seems about right
[05:57:22] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I did, BansheeTears. Rather intense, that battle, yes?

[20:00:36] <Chiaro> hey Widds... got a followup question for you
[20:04:22] <Widdershins> fire away
[20:04:33] <Widdershins> im about to head to wally world tho
[20:06:23] <Chiaro> You were saying that your concept of the "sacred feminine" is that it is like water or energy, but without an agenda or a direction, specifically, and I was wondering if you think there is set of divine principles -- take "justice", for example, which would represent a higher state of consciousness than "injustice", and thus suggest a certain "righ
[20:06:23] <Chiaro> t" versus "wrong" agenda, if you will, of the sacred feminine?
[20:07:09] <Widdershins> i do not
[20:07:32] <Widdershins> i do believe there is a balance and harmony
[20:07:45] <Chiaro> So "justice" is purely a human concept, then?
[20:07:48] <Widdershins> that the natural order will restore itself 
[20:07:56] <Widdershins> to me, yes
[20:08:25] <Widdershins> that doesnt mean i dont think people who hurt others are ok
[20:08:48] <Chiaro> oh... that's soooo dispassionate, isn't it?
[20:09:20] <Widdershins> i think that justice as we inderstand it is a humans way to seek to balance that they feel is tipped
[20:09:22] <Chiaro> That the Goddess doesn't care about the difference betwwen good and evil
[20:09:23] <Widdershins> not at all
[20:09:36] <Widdershins> i dont see the goddess that way
[20:09:46] <Widdershins> i see it as an energy
[20:10:04] <Widdershins> so not caring isnt really applicable
[20:10:51] <Chiaro> Like the sun, there but without any sense of beneficence
[20:11:17] <Widdershins> i think of it more like an ecosystem
[20:11:32] <Widdershins> it will try to right itself naturally
[20:12:27] <Chiaro> And there is nothing particularly "evil", then, about evildoers, eight?
[20:12:35] <Chiaro> right?
[20:12:54] <Widdershins> i see them as "missing something"
[20:13:14] <Widdershins> sick like illness
