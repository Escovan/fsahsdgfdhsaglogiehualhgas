[04:33:59] <North> I used to live in an apartment with no AC and zero crossbreeze....a kiln, essentially, in the Summer
[04:34:21] <North> but there was a thing I did which brought enormous relief:
[04:35:15] <North> filled the kitchen sink with about 6 inches of really cold water, immersed my forearms for a minute or two, then shook (or patted) them dry
[04:35:35] <North> the cooling off effect lasts an astonishingly long time....like a half hour

[05:40:42] <DawnBat> aight. So what does y'all know about Doreen Virtues - Angel Therapy
[05:41:02] <MissSuugar> not a darn thing
[05:41:15] <MissSuugar> i have her angel deck
[05:41:20] <MissSuugar> but thats about it
[05:41:24] <DawnBat> well was wondering how fluffy her site is
[05:41:38] <MissSuugar> dude dont worry about fluffy
[05:42:03] <DawnBat> well cause there's some stuff on Lightworkers, which she thinks she miht be
[05:42:12] <SpiritSong> she just very postive and light
[05:42:15] <MissSuugar> i will tell you what fluffy actually means, its a person who reads one book and then demand that they know weverything
[05:42:21] <DawnBat> ahhh
[05:42:24] <SpiritSong> in her writing
[05:42:35] <MissSuugar> being positive and a light worker doesnt apply

[05:43:34] <DawnBat> ohhh

[05:45:16] <North> that sounds about right!
[05:45:33] <MissSuugar> hey man being bubbly is a good thing, it means that she sees the world in a positive light and helps others be their best selves
[05:45:43] <MissSuugar> no need to worry about bubbly 
[05:46:05] <DawnBat> ironically
[05:46:15] <DawnBat> I have a seemingly darkness around me
[05:46:57] <SpiritSong> a lightworker is often a healer
[05:46:58] <MissSuugar> some witches are dark some are light
[05:47:16] <SpiritSong> its often their prime magical practice
[05:47:17] <MissSuugar> when you embrace who you are then there is no need to feel guilty
[05:47:28] <North> that might just be the empty packages of brownies, piled up past the windows/blocking out light
[05:47:34] <DawnBat> omfg
[05:47:35] <DawnBat> xD
[05:48:03] <DawnBat> Although the epxeirence we both had long ago might be why she's light nand I' dark
[05:48:36] <MissSuugar> in fact dark workers often protect light workers, you need a balance of both in this world
[05:48:58] <MissSuugar> dark workers are able to do the jobs that light workers arent able because of their light
[05:49:49] <DawnBat> I'm naturally inclined to death ._.
[05:52:16] <MissSuugar> if you want to work with spirits Dawn you need much more concentration than you have now
