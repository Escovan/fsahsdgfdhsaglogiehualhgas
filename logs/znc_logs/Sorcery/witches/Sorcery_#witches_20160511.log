[03:03:22] <SpiritSong> you needed that
[03:03:37] <MissSugar> i really didnt, with the amount i sleep
[03:03:39] <MissSugar> but its nice
[03:04:06] <MissSugar> i got home and used jotform to create an entry form to get a dream reading
[03:04:26] <SpiritSong> where did you go
[03:04:34] <SpiritSong> and what is jotform?
[03:04:36] <MissSugar> we were out most of the day trying to fix Cottons stereo system, so i was reading the book most of the day, and i have it pretty well figured out
[03:04:37] <SpiritSong> ooooh
[03:04:41] <SpiritSong> yeah gotcha
[03:04:46] <MissSugar> jotform is form creating site
[03:04:57] <MissSugar> super easy to use
[03:05:01] <SpiritSong> sweet how do the readings work?
[03:05:57] <MissSugar> ok so the person being read for the dreamer, picks a main theme in their dream, they then pick how they responded to the dream in the dream, then i pick a third card based on intuition
[03:06:36] <MissSugar> i ask for a brief description of the dream and from there i pick 3 cards from the deck that have those themes
[03:07:13] <MissSugar> i then pick the source cards that go with those dream cards to read the messages and meanings associated from those source cards
[03:08:31] <MissSugar> i then look at the main shape on the card and find the archetypes of the card and find the divination from there
[03:08:33] <MissSugar> *there
[03:08:47] <MissSugar> its a lot less complicated then it sounds
[03:12:22] <SpiritSong> back sorry
[03:12:25] <SpiritSong> potty break :P
[03:12:29] <MissSugar> LOL wb
[03:12:55] <SpiritSong> it sounds like a fun reading

[18:01:35] <DawnBat> true
[18:01:37] <DawnBat> btw
[18:01:55] <Witchit> Yeah, I really don't like it when people accuse others of being fat when they're actually healthy
[18:01:59] <DawnBat> If someone is stranded and has to eat a friend. Does the already present curiosity for people help?
[18:02:10] <Witchit> Uhhh
[18:02:16] <Witchit> Not sure entirely XD
[18:02:32] <DawnBat> cause people sound kind of tasty...
[18:02:58] <Witchit> It's actually scientifically proven you'd go insane if you eat another person :D
[18:03:04] <DawnBat> not exactly
[18:03:12] <DawnBat> depends on what you eat and how it is cooked
[18:03:26] <Witchit> Jesus, you researched this?! XD
[18:03:54] <DawnBat> ....too many times
[18:04:02] <Witchit> Welp
[18:04:10] <Witchit> At least you want to learn
[18:04:21] <DawnBat> I'd probably wanna be stranded with a bodybulder. They're so meaty.
[18:04:41] <Witchit> They might actually help you survive if they're that strong :/
[18:04:57] <DawnBat> true
[18:05:01] <Witchit> You should only do it if it's an EXTREMELY LAST RESORT
[18:05:10] <Witchit> *EXTREME
[18:05:11] <DawnBat> just like. I'll go out with you....if you bring me that coyote
[18:05:29] <Witchit> Test your might!

[18:06:23] <Witchit> I'm more attracted to nerdy people anyway
[18:06:26] <DawnBat> :p
[18:06:58] <Witchit> He is actually so nerdy that he wears dress shirts to school XD

[18:08:34] <Witchit> I hate skinny jeans, and yet I wear jeggings because why not
[18:08:49] <Witchit> Even though wearing fake pockets reaaally bothers me
[18:09:01] <DawnBat> :p
[18:09:06] <DawnBat> question : "a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience."
[18:09:11] <Witchit> I attempted to shove a candy bar in one by accident, and it got on my pants
[18:09:13] <DawnBat> that literally souns like me sometimes
[18:09:27] <Witchit> Honestly, try not to diagnose yourself
[18:09:34] <Witchit> It does not end well
[18:09:44] <DawnBat> ohI'mnot

[18:10:35] <Witchit> Hi AntleredGirl!
[18:10:40] <AntleredGirl> Howdy, Witchit. 
[18:11:00] <Witchit> We're talking about disorders today
[18:11:03] <DawnBat> AntleredGirl :D
[18:11:10] <AntleredGirl> Oh my. 
[18:11:11] <DawnBat> Antlers sound like a disorrder
[18:11:14] <AntleredGirl> DawnBat: Hiya.
[18:11:18] <DawnBat> should get those checked out
[18:11:25] <AntleredGirl> No, this AntleredGirl has a bigger problem than antlers. 
[18:11:43] <Witchit> I feel bad that I used to laugh at the disorder name of 'shingles' until I realized what it actually is
[18:11:46] <DawnBat> I'm a glutton
[18:11:52] <Witchit> I was nine, and a complete idiot
[18:11:53] <DawnBat> that's my diagnosis
[18:12:09] <Witchit> Heheheh, I don't think that really is XD
[18:12:26] <Witchit> I have a ton of mental illnesses unfortunately, but that doesn't stop me. Sometimes.
[18:12:45] <DawnBat> disorders and I are like Pokemon.........gotta catch 'em all!
[18:13:23] <Witchit> By the way, AntleredGirl, I was inspired by your collection of tarot cards, and I begged my parents to give me money to buy another tarot deck :)
[18:13:39] <Witchit> They said yes, and now I'm getting more cards :P
[18:13:51] <AntleredGirl> Hooray!

[18:14:16] <DawnBat> Tarot Cards! Gotta cathe em all!
[18:14:20] <AntleredGirl> It's the bread and butter of the tarot collection. 
[18:14:25] <H-> wait

[18:14:33] <H-> I hae to try this

[18:14:45] <Witchit> I actually already bought a certain deck that I liked better
[18:15:01] <Witchit> And don't try it at home kids, I'm lucky my parents are slightly flexible
[18:15:33] <Witchit> They don't always give me money, but they were pretty proud of me for my responsibility
[18:15:44] <Witchit> So that's why they gave me the cash
[18:15:57] <DawnBat> I mean like
[18:16:02] <DawnBat> you could bribe them
[18:16:24] <Witchit> It's probably also because I paid for the mother's day present XD
[18:16:42] <DawnBat> oooh
[18:16:46] <DawnBat> whatwasit
[18:16:56] <DawnBat> a 15 karat gold statue of your dad encrusted with diaonds
[18:17:30] <AntleredGirl> A 15 karat gold statue of a okay not going there
[18:17:35] <Witchit> It was my idea. I bought her an aromatherapy necklace, the top 6 oils chosen from a top company, and pads for the oils to fit in the necklace
[18:17:53] <H-> must've been a tiny statue then eh AntleredGirl ;)
[18:17:58] <Witchit> I also made my grandma her own purse

[18:21:08] <AntleredGirl> Try it at night when you get home.
[18:21:19] <Witchit> Once I get back in the groove, I'll be doing more meditation and lighting incense
[18:21:23] <AntleredGirl> Before you do anything else, go to the altar. The altar is supposed to be the center of the home, the grounding-place.

[18:46:38] <Witchit> I just don't want to tell it here because it's a little too upsetting for some people to handle
[18:47:05] <Witchit> So if anyone can take something a little shocking, I'd be really grateful
[18:47:41] <Iona> Witchit: I'm two-ears (not all ears...), and while I may not have much to say, or a solution, I can listen...

[18:55:17] <Witchit> Sounds like a Pokemon
[18:55:19] <AntleredGirl> POoh!
[18:55:21] <AntleredGirl> It's 
[18:55:23] <DawnBat> muktuk is 
[18:55:24] <AntleredGirl> narwhale skin!
[18:55:26] <DawnBat> whale blubber
[18:55:39] <AntleredGirl> Narwhale skin, particularly, for those Inuit who live in Greenland.
[18:55:41] <DawnBat> it's blubber actually. And chewed like gum
[18:55:58] <DawnBat> I'm speaking of Alaska and the Arctice Circle
[18:56:05] <AntleredGirl> It's frozen whale skin AND blubbre.
[18:56:08] <Witchit> Interesting....
[18:56:09] <AntleredGirl> blubber. *
[18:56:15] <Iona> if you want readily available gum, find a tree that is dripping sap - collect some and chew it...
[18:56:18] <DawnBat> plus narwhals suck
[18:56:19] <Witchit> And yet, slightly disgusting sounding 0_o
[18:56:19] <AntleredGirl> Pound for pound it has just enough Vitamin C as oranges.
[18:56:30] <AntleredGirl> It's the most important part of the Inuit diet. 
[18:56:41] <DawnBat> narwhals are a ripoff of unicorns'

[19:03:07] <DawnBat> kind of wanna blast Satanic music throughout the building

[19:08:10] <DawnBat> I don't speak human and Eart Warrior are good. But they're like.......Alpha Hippy
[19:08:29] <DawnBat> but like that didgeridoo. And the main guy can shred the flute.
[19:08:46] <Witchit> Shredding the flute is a term I've never heard....
[19:09:01] <AntleredGirl> My preference lies along the lines of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2e_M06YDyY

[19:09:27] <DawnBat> am I gonna cry

[19:09:32] <AntleredGirl> You are.
[19:09:38] <AntleredGirl> But Melodysheep is my favorite artist.

[19:10:21] <DawnBat> challenge failed ;~;
[19:10:26] <Witchit> Aw
[19:11:12] <DawnBat> Like honestly I am super depressed but in a happy way
[19:11:24] <AntleredGirl> I know, right? 
[19:11:35] <AntleredGirl> Try looking at Melodysheep's other works. 
[19:11:42] <Witchit> Robin Williams was great, even in the movies he was in that sucked.
[19:11:49] <AntleredGirl> He did Bob Ross, Mr Rogers, Julia Child, LaVarr Burton, Spock.
[19:11:55] <AntleredGirl> Even the Crocodile Hunter.
[19:12:00] <DawnBat> guyrl
[19:12:04] <Witchit> Every time he was in one, he lit up the stage :)

[19:16:19] <H-> o/
[19:16:21] <Witchit> Guess what? My Witches' Runes came in the mail!
[19:16:29] <Iona> DawnBat: pour some salt on it and let it soak.
[19:16:30] <DawnBat> yay!
[19:16:31] <Hrafnbjorn> groovy
[19:16:36] <DawnBat> Iona: What?
[19:16:36] <Iona> Yay Witchit 
[19:16:46] <Iona> Cleanse it.
[19:16:51] <DawnBat> oh
[19:16:57] <Witchit> I also bought a deck of tarot cards after begging my parents to give me money XD
[19:17:10] <DawnBat> goodness. I have a booty like a hippo today
[19:17:19] <Witchit> Thanks Iona ^ ^
[19:17:49] <Hrafnbjorn> the Witches Runes arent actualy runes, they just gave them that name to make them sound old and archaic
[19:17:54] <Witchit> Oh
[19:18:01] <Witchit> Gotcha
[19:18:17] <Witchit> I tried research, but I guess I still don't know enough :/
[19:18:38] <Hrafnbjorn> there are a lot of folk that just aply the term 'rune' to any hidden alphabet, or symbol set, but runes are very specific, and not the symbols themselves
[19:18:48] <Witchit> So what would I call them? :)
[19:19:00] <Witchit> Witches' Symbols?
[19:19:14] <Hrafnbjorn> there is certainly nothing wrong with the Witches Runes, just offering thorough understanding of 'runes;
[19:19:27] <Witchit> Right, thanks for the assistance ^ ^
[19:19:35] <Witchit> Man, I wish I was good at memorization
[19:19:40] <Hrafnbjorn> ya can call them Witches Runes if ya like, I was just making the clarification
[19:19:54] <Witchit> No prob, then I will :)
[19:20:32] <Witchit> Hraf, this is the tarot deck I bought: http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/silicon-dawn/
[19:21:00] <Witchit> Even though they have like 97 cards, I really like their design and meanings
[19:21:31] <Hrafnbjorn> those remind me of a Tim Burton movie :)
[19:21:56] <Hrafnbjorn> nice art style though
[19:22:03] <Witchit> Yeah! I love Tim Burton. They remind me a lot of something gothic and modern at the same tie
[19:22:05] <Witchit> *time
[19:22:20] <DawnBat> this girl I know on FB doesn't know Deadpool...
[19:22:33] <Witchit> :/ What did she say about him?
[19:22:40] <DawnBat> she's like
[19:22:44] <DawnBat> idk about them
[19:23:06] <Iona> idk about Deadpool either.
[19:23:08] <DawnBat> now she's like "I'm not 20"
[19:23:19] <Witchit> At least she didn't say "Live long and prosper: I love Star Wars!"
[19:23:23] <Hrafnbjorn> I know very little about him
[19:23:25] <Witchit> I've seen that one before
[19:23:35] <DawnBat> Silicon Dawn
[19:23:46] <DawnBat> sounds like my ex girlfriend
[19:23:47] <Witchit> I've read a lot of his comics, and love him dearly XD

[19:25:18] <Witchit> That would be terrifying
[19:25:33] <Witchit> Those doll eyes looking into your soul

[19:25:43] <Witchit> Those empty, demonic eyes 0_o
[19:26:00] <DawnBat> Ken is secretly gay
[19:26:00] <Witchit> It would probably be a close-up of her boobs
[19:26:03] <DawnBat> omfg
[19:26:13] <Witchit> I wouldn't be surprised about Ken
[19:26:29] <DawnBat> have you seen how fake barbie is
[19:26:31] <Witchit> After Barbie Dreamhouse, I think that opinion stands
[19:26:53] <Hrafnbjorn> do you expect a doll to NOT be fake?
[19:26:54] <Witchit> Well yeah, she's plastic, and I'm surprised she can stand with toothpick legs and a waist the size of a cookie
[19:27:02] <Witchit> *can't
[19:27:06] <DawnBat> truth
[19:27:28] <DawnBat> "Where's muh swzarchenegger barbie!"
[19:27:49] <Witchit> I'm happy they're starting to make barbies of twelve different sizes and shapes now
[19:28:07] <Witchit> Realistic barbies scare me, but at least they're REALISTIC
[19:28:09] <DawnBat> Im happy for the new sesame street gal
[19:28:33] <Iona> Hrafnbjorn: by projecting anthropomorphism onto inanimate objects...
[19:28:51] <Witchit> What's the news with Sesame street?
[19:28:52] <Iona> ...by continuing that line of thought, one can easily get sucked into it...
[19:29:03] <Hrafnbjorn> I suppose
[19:29:11] <DawnBat> http://www.yupthatexists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DadBodKen.jpg
[19:29:12] <DawnBat> Ohgawd
[19:29:14] <DawnBat> it BURNS
[19:29:27] <Witchit> Whoa
[19:29:29] <Witchit> Whooooa
[19:29:29] <Iona> DawnBat: I hope your search for meaning is fruitful.
[19:29:32] <Witchit> Whoooooooooooa

[19:29:46] <Witchit> WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOA

[19:30:03] <DawnBat> and there's gonna be a Sesame Street girl with a hijab
[19:30:09] <Witchit> Oh, cool!
[19:30:17] <Witchit> -tries to ignore demonic Ken-
[19:30:20] <Hrafnbjorn> I would love to be able to make rune sets for folk, but shipping for non-business clients makes it a bit rediculous for cost
[19:30:47] <Witchit> I would love to pay you for a set, Hraf. (when I get the money)
[19:30:54] <DawnBat> there was a preganant barbie once
[19:31:01] <Witchit> Oh I know about that DawnBat
[19:31:05] <Witchit> Still terrifying
[19:31:07] <Hrafnbjorn> *ridiculous
[19:31:20] <DawnBat> terrfyingly ridciulous?
[19:31:27] <Witchit> Exactly
[19:31:43] <Hrafnbjorn> it cost just under $20 to send a stone set to Widders
[19:31:56] <Witchit> I will pay more if you like :)
[19:32:00] <Hrafnbjorn> wood ones might be a bit cheaper, but its still too much
[19:32:31] <DawnBat> quiz titled "What is your guardian angel saying?"
[19:32:33] <Witchit> I think I have leftover money from my last commission
[19:32:39] <DawnBat> gurl, I don't even WANT to know!
[19:32:43] <Hrafnbjorn> decide whether ya want younger futhark, Saxon futhorc, or elder futhark, and I will make ya a set, Witchit
[19:32:47] <Witchit> It's saying "Dear god don't make a weird Ken"
[19:32:57] <DawnBat> true
[19:33:10] <Witchit> Hrafnbjorn: Elder would be good :)
[19:33:18] <Witchit> We can discuss the price whenever
[19:33:20] <Hrafnbjorn> the younger and Saxon are only ones with actual lore... but the elder has the most amount of books written about them, but the info is based on the other 2
[19:33:38] <Witchit> I know a little more about Elder than the others
[19:33:41] <DawnBat> my guardian angel is saying I will recieve more love
[19:33:50] <DawnBat> spooky cause I have a date on Friday
[19:34:01] <Witchit> I don't really like those quizzes
[19:34:14] <Hrafnbjorn> I have 2 sets done now, both fro younger row, one is stones, the other is plum wood
[19:34:22] <Witchit> Especially ones that are like "Who is your hot anime boyfriend"
[19:34:27] <DawnBat> hmmm
[19:34:33] <DawnBat> it's Dad Bod Ken
[19:34:37] <Iona> Hrafnbjorn: then settle for value-added marketing, like "handmade!" or "without factory taint"
[19:34:44] <Witchit> Looking up plum wood now
[19:34:45] <Hrafnbjorn> the plum wood ones:  https://scontent-dfw1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13139093_10209313454062293_1526027600083931593_n.jpg?oh=a4bdd1aa344ff2d2ebab7ad7f2fb8503&oe=57A2F230
[19:34:57] <Iona> (if you go that route)
[19:35:01] <Witchit> Those are pretty!
[19:35:06] <Iona> very nice!
[19:35:16] <DawnBat> Hrafnbjorn: Was expecting purple xD
[19:35:19] <Witchit> You were always very talented with wood ^ ^
[19:35:23] <Witchit> (Me too DawnBat)
[19:35:38] <Hrafnbjorn> they were just a quick job to test how mineral oil works for treating the wood, so I can make much nicer ones
[19:35:51] <Witchit> I love those, but a better set is fine with me ^ ^
[19:35:59] <DawnBat> thought you said butter
[19:35:59] <Witchit> Those are the younger Futhark right?
[19:36:02] *** Quits: Hrafnbjorn (IceChat9@sorcery-j81476.p2cu.tfj1.05b0.2001.IP) (Connection closed)

[19:38:08] <Witchit> GENIUS
[19:38:08] <Hrafnbjorn> :)
[19:38:34] <Witchit> Anyway, do you want to talk about the price in pm?
[19:38:36] <DawnBat> Witchit: Did you hear
[19:39:01] <Witchit> Is bird the word -_-
[19:39:04] <DawnBat> dad bod Ken is your anime boyfriend
[19:39:13] <Hrafnbjorn> if you have studied the elder ones, you have unknowingly studied the younger and saxon ones, since we only know the stave shape, and phonetic value, and stave order for the elder, we dont know for sure any of the symbology
[19:39:18] <Witchit> AAAAA
[19:39:34] <Witchit> Ohhh
[19:39:38] <Witchit> Okay Hrafnbjorn
[19:39:52] <Hrafnbjorn> price would just be shipping cost... they are quick to make, so no need for extra beyond shipping :)
[19:39:59] <Witchit> Are you sure?
[19:40:05] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[19:40:11] <Witchit> That would mean you get nothing in return
[19:40:30] <Hrafnbjorn> :)
[19:40:35] <Witchit> Do you live in the US?
[19:40:47] <Hrafnbjorn> yep, California
[19:40:56] <Witchit> Okay, so I'll give you 40 then
[19:41:05] <Witchit> So you get more money :)
[19:41:19] <Hrafnbjorn> whatever ya feel if fair
[19:41:32] <Witchit> It's the least I can do for you teaching me so much ^ ^
[19:41:50] <Hrafnbjorn> do you like the style of the ones I linked, or do you prefer the coin shape type?
[19:42:08] <Witchit> Anything you want :) Be creative
[19:42:19] <Hrafnbjorn> ok, I can do that, lol
[19:42:51] <Hrafnbjorn> I just got Widder's woodburned plaque in the mail yesterday... excited for her to hang it, and enjoy it :)

[19:44:56] <Witchit> Hmmm
[19:45:13] <Witchit> Maybe you can google the equivelant of regular ovens to toaster ones
[19:45:34] <DawnBat> I don't even know if the toaster ovens work
[19:45:43] <Witchit> It's worth a shot, right?
[19:45:44] <Hrafnbjorn> dont need an oven here in summer, just put it outside under glass, and it cooks just like an oven
[19:45:49] <Witchit> Hahahahah
[19:45:55] * DawnBat sends meals to Hrafnbjorn
[19:46:23] <Witchit> Yeah, New York doesn't work like that XD
[19:46:45] <DawnBat> y'all ready for July 4th
[19:47:02] <Witchit> Really no, because I'll be in summer class
[19:47:16] <H-> doesnt matter for me, we don't celebrate it
[19:47:17] <Witchit> Which means since I'm studying I'll miss the fireworks :(
[19:47:29] <DawnBat> well
[19:47:33] <Hrafnbjorn> 4th of July is just another holiday here, cant use firewirks or anything, so unless ya go to one of the public firework shows, its just another night
[19:47:33] <DawnBat> that's when the apocalypse is
[19:48:10] <Hrafnbjorn> WHAT everyone should celebrate the the US independance day, we rule the world!!!!
[19:48:16] <Witchit> XD
[19:48:17] <Hrafnbjorn> lol, I am kidding of course
[19:48:33] <Witchit> Which means I'm only 0% American. Yaaaay.
[19:49:06] <DawnBat> i'm a canuck
[19:49:07] <Iona> I'm 100% purebred American mutt.  In other words, I'm too multinational to be American.
[19:49:16] <AntleredGirl> I'm Texan.
[19:49:18] <AntleredGirl> I don't count.
[19:49:24] <Witchit> Hahaha,
[19:49:43] <DawnBat> I think Montanans shouldn'[t count
[19:49:45] <Witchit> My great grandparents are from Czechoslovakia and Austria
[19:49:50] <Iona> Yes, one (gold) star for AntleredGirl :)
[19:49:56] <Witchit> And then my dad's dad is from Britain
[19:50:02] <AntleredGirl> (haha, a lone star for AntleredGirl )
[19:50:05] <Witchit> So we're kind of a weird family
[19:50:36] <Witchit> We're also VERY Jewish (except for me)
[19:50:38] <Iona> Some of my family has been here since the Mayflower.  ...so yeah, 100% purebred mutt.
[19:50:54] <Witchit> Interesting Iona, that must be some family history
[19:50:59] <DawnBat> I've been here since the mothership\
[19:51:01] <Hrafnbjorn> I am Swedish on dads side, Danish on moms, with maybe some Yosemite Miwok on moms side, but we cant get confirmation on that
[19:51:12] <Iona> DawnBat: you're spilling your secrets
[19:51:25] <DawnBat> Iona: Well I go home on July 4th so

[19:51:37] <Iona> It's the Danish that shows most in me - just don't add frosting to me...
[19:51:54] <DawnBat> the Kardashians and Jenners came from my homeworld
[19:51:55] <DawnBat> sadly
[19:52:03] <Witchit> There were stories of my great uncle, during World War II, walking from Germany all the way to Britain because his family were rich and Jewish
[19:52:13] <DawnBat> you can't walk...
[19:52:16] <Iona> DawnBat: pics from the future or it didn't happen.
[19:52:24] <DawnBat> there's a huge canal
[19:52:34] <Witchit> Not really ALL the way
[19:52:44] <DawnBat> Iona: Caitlyn is obviously
[19:52:46] <DawnBat> she shapeshifted
[19:52:47] <Witchit> He did hitchhike sometimes and take a boat
[19:52:59] <Witchit> But it was mainly walking
[19:53:08] <DawnBat> https://duelcitizen.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/alien-face.jpg
[19:53:22] <Witchit> And my dad likes to glorify it like it's some great movie XD
[19:53:40] <Witchit> I'd believe it, DawnBat
[19:54:26] <Witchit> There was another story where the nazis took my uncle's dog as well
[19:54:30] <Witchit> *dad's
[19:54:37] <DawnBat> wow
[19:54:38] <Witchit> *dad's dad's
[19:54:40] <Witchit> Whoops
[19:54:43] <Witchit> WHY DO I DO THINGS
[19:54:56] <DawnBat> Nicki Minaj is the enemy of my species
[19:55:25] <Witchit> It's very sad really. She multiplies by spouting random nonsense from her mouth
[19:55:37] <DawnBat> ohmfg
[19:55:41] <Witchit> XD
[19:55:57] <Witchit> To be honest, I don't really like Nicki
[19:56:03] <DawnBat> most "american" artists brainwash with their hidden alien messages
[19:56:10] <Witchit> I'd believe it
[19:56:19] <Witchit> Especially One Direction
[19:56:37] <DawnBat> Zayn managed to escape after converting to Humanism
[19:56:56] <Witchit> Hahaha

[23:31:41] <BansheeTears> Gotta strip and drop the clothes out the window too
[23:31:59] <SpiritSong> why the window?
[23:32:13] <SpiritSong> oh so not to have them traipse round the hosue
[23:32:23] <BansheeTears> Can't carry them through the house or put them in the hamper cause he has fleas
[23:32:31] <SpiritSong> ahh
[23:32:34] <XCuteWitchX> Staying at my grandmas and someone In the apartment over preached at me when I was wearing a necklace that was wiccan and explained it a belief based on nature representing a god and goddess and mentioned that the god is associated with the sun (the masculine) and the goddess with the moon because of the menstrual cycle and her roommate in the next apartment
[23:32:35] <XCuteWitchX> over started preaching about how "god gave periods for women to have babies" and completely missed what I was explaining. But whatever. I kept my cool and was respectful and made her look like the idiot even when she said she didn't like it. I'm tired of hiding my beliefs...
[23:33:06] <BansheeTears> Nicely handled
[23:33:24] <SpiritSong> god gave periods???  now we know who the feck to blame...it would be a "man"
[23:33:31] <SpiritSong> >_>
[23:33:32] <BansheeTears> Lol!!
[23:33:56] <SpiritSong> and well handled XCuteWitchX
[23:33:58] <SpiritSong> :)
[23:34:02] <XCuteWitchX> She said "listen to your grandma."....... Really? I'm an adult able to believe whatever I choose
[23:34:10] <XCuteWitchX> I'm not a satanist
[23:34:12] <XCuteWitchX> Thank you
[23:34:17] <XCuteWitchX> )o( pride
[23:34:17] <BansheeTears> There ya go
[23:34:35] <BansheeTears> And even if you chose that, it's still your right to choose
[23:35:01] <SpiritSong> ^
[23:35:13] <XCuteWitchX> Exactly. I just needed to hop onto my real home
[23:35:27] <SpiritSong> :)
[23:35:39] <BansheeTears> I'm having an issue with a group I'm in
[23:35:47] <XCuteWitchX> Oh dear
[23:36:12] <BansheeTears> Fits supposed to be open to all, pagan, Christian or whatever
[23:36:12] <SpiritSong> which one?
[23:36:23] <BansheeTears> It's a woman's group
[23:36:31] <SpiritSong> ooh i know which one now
[23:36:34] <BansheeTears> But not religious.
[23:36:44] <SpiritSong> are they trying to include a group type
[23:36:59] <BansheeTears> However there are more pagans than Christians
[23:37:42] <BansheeTears> And at the close the leader of the group asked us to join hands for a prayer to the goddess
[23:37:44] <XCuteWitchX> Lol that's not going to mix. Christians and pagans. Yikes
[23:38:03] * XCuteWitchX can only imagine the arguments
[23:38:04] <BansheeTears> Yet, one of the group members is Mormon
[23:38:14] <BansheeTears> I thought it inappropriate
[23:38:40] <BansheeTears> It's supposed to be a women's group not a pagan, or affiliated group
[23:38:53] <BansheeTears> I felt bad for the Mormon and Christian
[23:38:54] <SpiritSong> ahhh thats going to make them feel excluded :/
[23:39:20] <BansheeTears> Or forced to participate in paganism in order to be in the group
[23:40:15] <BansheeTears> A women's group is a woman's group. It wasn't supposed to be a religious indoctrination
[23:40:47] <SpiritSong> agreed
[23:41:18] <BansheeTears> So I'm torn as to wether or not I want to proceed
[23:41:34] <XCuteWitchX> I don't want to sound sexist but women are more bullheaded and argumentative.
[23:41:36] <XCuteWitchX> Brb
[23:41:52] <BansheeTears> We sure can be
[23:41:59] <SpiritSong> do they have a suggestion box for that kind of thing
[23:42:04] <BansheeTears> Nope
[23:42:12] <BansheeTears> I'll have to bring it up
[23:42:14] <SpiritSong> could you tell her straight? or would be bite 
[23:42:16] <SpiritSong> she
[23:42:22] <BansheeTears> And many of my coven mates are members
[23:42:37] <SpiritSong> some peole caaaannnnnt take constructive critism
[23:42:47] <SpiritSong> but she might not evern have thought of it
[23:43:17] <BansheeTears> I don't know her well, but I'm thinking I might suggest a prayer to God to follow the prayer to the goddess...
[23:43:29] <SpiritSong> thats a good idea
[23:43:44] <BansheeTears> So the others don't feel excluded and it would stay positive
[23:43:53] <BansheeTears> I think she would get the hint
[23:43:54] <SpiritSong> besides....being a woman doesnt mean only paying attention to the feminine in any case
[23:44:02] <BansheeTears> I agree
[23:44:07] <SpiritSong> there is balance in a prayer t bothe the god and goddess
