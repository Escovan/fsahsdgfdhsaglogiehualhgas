[03:30:20] <Rajoguna> It was fun at first, then not fun. Then fun again. Then scary. Then deppressing and wanted me to kill myself.
[03:30:40] <Rajoguna> And then it can fracture your sense of self too.
[03:31:44] <Rajoguna> just be careful what control and power you give to entities you create/summon/believe in
[03:31:55] <Rajoguna> i kinda learned to be ultra defensive after that spiritually
[03:32:13] <Rajoguna> its easier to shut it off than turn it back on sometimess i find though, which is at least a problem for me
[03:32:43] <Rajoguna> but i was also suffering from Kundalini sickness so 
[03:32:49] <Rajoguna> i had other crap going on to
[03:33:19] <Rajoguna> dont do kundalini yoga or anyhting like that without proper guidence some magic is best left alone unless you have a good teacher
[03:33:29] <WhiteChocolate> Kundalini?
[03:33:34] <Rajoguna> mostly due to the psychological risk
[03:33:51] <Rajoguna> its a form/piece of shakti energy said to reside at the base of the spine
[03:34:19] <Rajoguna> its hindu but a lot of new age people use it with chakras but they almost always dont do real kundalini or real chakra work with an awakened kundalini
[03:34:43] <Rajoguna> I think the book Seperent Power was the one that made the 7 chakra system so popular
[03:35:24] <Rajoguna> cant type laggy. but anyways i do chakras and kundalini now but messing with stuff when i started out years ago, without knowing what i had done, made my ride kinda crazy

[05:03:29] <North> why do you require a background story, Chiaro?
[05:08:19] <Chiaro> Curiosity to explore the limits of the psyche, I guess.  Someone created the image.  Chances are the subject was a vampire, but that seems so trite, and it's such a provocative painting.

[05:30:44] <North> I started to read up on a thing called the 'Cheerios Effect'...
[05:31:08] <North> but lost interest after this started:
[05:31:10] <North> 2\pi\gamma RB^{5/2}\Sigma^2K_1\left(\frac{\ell}{L_c}\right)
[05:31:11] <North> where \gamma is the surface tension, K_1 is a modified Bessel function of the first kind, B=\rho gR^2/\gamma is the Bond number, and
[05:31:12] <North> \Sigma=\frac{2\rho_s/\rho-1}{3}-\frac{\cos\theta}{2}+\frac{\cos^3\theta}{6}
[05:31:13] <North> is a nondimensional factor in terms of the contact angle \theta. Here L_C=R/\sqrt{B} is a convenient meniscus length scale.
[05:31:56] <MCMLXV> that looks like a lost carrier dump
[05:32:35] <North> Erinn might be able to make sense of it

[20:03:00] <North> o/
[20:03:02] <CircleReverse> what is your body telling you, in this moment, about how you're feeling?..
[20:03:10] *** Quits: North (North@sorcery-22uka0.dsl.bell.ca) (Quit: Caring about whether something makes sense only leads to writer's block and, ultimately, suicide.)
[20:03:22] <CircleReverse> like, what kind of burnt out?  
[20:03:54] <Aria> To explain that, I will need to explain what happened
[20:04:06] <Aria> [19:23:20]  <+Aria>	I went super-hyper on energy a few days ago, it was a never-ending flow of energy that I had to constantly dump into things to control it. Eventually I learnt I could ground and then dump it into the Earth constantly, something I'd never tried before because I usually run out of energy if I do that too long.. So then I had all of that going on, or half or more than half a day, and eventually I was getting headaches
[20:04:06] <Aria>  and things.. I needed to sleep
[20:04:06] <Aria> [19:23:20]  <+Aria>	but couldn't, so I had to learn how to turn it off...
[20:04:06] <Aria> [19:23:34]  <+Aria>	When I did, I went to sleep... and the morning after, I was completely broken. I call it the "crash"
[20:05:00] <CircleReverse> a period of rest is completely appropriate.l..  
[20:05:37] <Aria> I want to know how to handle this the best I can so that I can restore...
[20:05:42] <Aria> no magick for a while?
[20:05:50] <Aria> that's what most people have been telling me
[20:06:26] <CircleReverse> well, it's like over-exercising a muscle -- the muscle is still there, but the ability for it to perform is not...
[20:06:46] <Aria> CircleReverse: what does that mean?..
[20:06:57] <CircleReverse> resting will help.
[20:07:17] <Aria> will it heal when I rest?...
[20:07:24] <Aria> back to how it was before?..
[20:07:55] <CircleReverse> That depends on one person - you - and how you treat yourself...
[20:08:24] <Aria> what kind of rest do I need?..
[20:10:36] <CircleReverse> What do you think of this?  some inactivity, some small exercises (basics never really go out of style...), and to accept how things are without judgement or expectations?...
[20:11:10] <Aria> exercises?.. accept how things are?..
[20:11:14] <Aria> why did this hapen to me?...
[20:11:44] <CircleReverse> ^ it might not even be about you...
[20:12:02] <Aria> then what is it about?..
[20:12:16] <CircleReverse> getting yourself worked up about it isn't treating yourself kindly...
[20:12:42] <Aria> im worried...
[20:12:53] <CircleReverse> I can't say what it is about
[20:13:03] <CircleReverse> but I can say that you are right where you are, and that's okay...
[20:13:20] <Aria> it seemed like a reward at the time...
[20:13:25] <Aria> i had healed someone, i had done a good deed...
[20:13:30] <Aria> i got charged with a lot of energy...
[20:13:31] * CircleReverse smiles...
[20:13:44] <Aria> .....but now, i feel like this...
[20:13:44] <CircleReverse> rewards are nice.
[20:13:49] <Aria> what have i done wrong?..
[20:14:21] <CircleReverse> you are developing skills.
[20:14:38] <CircleReverse> it's easy to go too far too fast, because of exhiliration, etc...  
[20:14:51] <CircleReverse> and guess what?  you're not the only one who does so.
[20:14:59] <CircleReverse> <~ has done so too!
[20:15:35] <CircleReverse> you found a new joy - that's a beautiful thing.  treasure it...
[20:16:53] <Aria> how did you get out of it, CircleReverse?..
[20:18:31] <CircleReverse> by embracing all of the experience, pleasant and unpleasant.
[20:18:43] <CircleReverse> it's a good experience to have!
[20:18:50] <CircleReverse> live life...  
[20:18:58] <CircleReverse> enjoy it...  
[20:24:44] <Aria> I don't understand...
[20:26:24] <June> i do and it does not relate to me
[20:26:26] <H-> meditate, find your center, come to peace with yourself
[20:26:28] <H-> and accept it
[20:26:59] <CircleReverse> What do you suggest, June?
[20:28:22] <CircleReverse> Aria: I'm thinking
[20:35:35] <H-> or.. just.. don't react at all :)
[20:36:58] <CircleReverse> a reaction tells a story
[20:37:35] <CircleReverse> the thing is: not all those stories are true...  
[20:37:49] <H-> wonderfull
[20:38:06] <CircleReverse> when I had my energy-crash, it took a long time for me to separate the stories from the experience itself...
[20:38:20] <CircleReverse> they are two different things.
[20:38:33] <June> sry CircleReverse i was afk
[20:38:46] <CircleReverse> No worries :)
[20:39:16] <CircleReverse> and so, I stopped telling myself those storiess, so I could understand the experience...  
[20:40:39] <CircleReverse> stories easily become a black and white make-a-definition thing...  
[20:40:51] <June> basically, i suggest aria looks to herself to find the answers that only she knows truly
[20:41:18] <CircleReverse> "this is bad"  "this was yummy"  "this may be awkard" - all stories which obscure a deeper truth...  
[20:41:27] <CircleReverse> the truth of the experience...
[20:41:35] <CircleReverse> same, June...
[20:41:43] <June> yup
[20:41:54] <CircleReverse> thank you for putting it more succinctly.
[20:44:01] <June> the answer to everything is always simple
[20:44:19] <June> the moment it becomes complex, it is a lie imho

[20:45:21] <June> CircleReverse has given you very simple answers to your question aria, but i fear you are looking for something more complex
