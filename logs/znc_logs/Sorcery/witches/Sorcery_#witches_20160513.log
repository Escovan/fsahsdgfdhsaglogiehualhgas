[01:48:16] <Witchit> Heheheh
[01:48:51] <Witchit> Don't worry about it, one day I shall tell you the tale of how bad ice cream actually saved me from a house falling on me
[01:48:55] <Witchit> (a cardboard one)
[01:49:00] <Witchit> (In a play)
[01:49:08] <Witchit> (Thank god it wasn't a real house)
[01:49:31] <North> a worldview-making event, sounds like
[01:49:36] <Witchit> Yeah...
[01:49:56] <Witchit> To sum it up, I was very young in a school play. I pretended to be sick to get out of it
[01:50:14] <Witchit> So I ate ice cream, and pretended to be sick afterwards
[01:50:21] <North> lol
[01:50:25] <Witchit> Out of curiousity
[01:50:31] <North> you were right to do that thing
[01:50:33] <Witchit> I snuck into the play to see it XD
[01:50:39] <Witchit> Like a complete idiot
[01:50:46] <Witchit> I sat in a seat
[01:51:00] <North> undisguised
[01:51:04] * North conjectures
[01:51:13] <Witchit> And the reason I did the whole sick thing was because the whole play history is REALLY serious
[01:51:30] <Witchit> Like, the year before the school did Phantom of the Opera
[01:51:44] <North> I'd like to suggest a thing at this point
[01:51:54] <Witchit> Yeah?
[01:52:16] <North> I submit that, on a fundamental level, you truly *were* sick
[01:52:30] <North> of going along with usual social overlay garbage!
[01:52:37] <Witchit> Hahahahaha, that too XD
[01:52:43] <Witchit> But yeah, so the play begun

[01:55:06] <Witchit> Unfortunately, I did get found out, but at that point it was too late for them to put me back in at the final day
[01:55:29] <North> well, eff them and their serious plays
[01:55:47] <Witchit> Yeah, I was harshly scolded for that by my teachers
[01:55:48] * SpiritSong looks at chat
[01:55:53] <SpiritSong> because im here but not
[01:56:03] <Witchit> But it was the best laugh I had in a while when I was in middle school
[01:56:09] <Witchit> Hi again SpiritSong!
[01:56:13] * North winks to the Juli-elf
[01:56:14] <SpiritSong> hi :)
[01:56:24] <North> every laugh counts
[01:56:32] <Witchit> Yeah, especially in middle school
[01:56:53] <Witchit> But it was hilarious to see all my worked up nerves crash down like, well, a cardboard house
[01:57:01] <Witchit> On a townsperson
[01:57:06] <North> lol
[01:57:09] <Witchit> It was awesome :D
[01:57:13] <North> love the analogy
[01:57:41] <Witchit> I have a lot of stories like that, I'm sure anyone would
[01:58:17] <Witchit> I have to brb
[01:58:28] <Witchit> Give me a half hour

[02:00:24] <North> the point is that Life seems unnecessarily difficult
[02:00:27] <North> most of the time
[02:00:30] <North> WHY

[02:02:14] <North> case in point, Sugarpants:  my loser irc client interprets you're probably incisive emoji into a series of incomprehensible characters
[02:02:28] <MissSuugar> DANGIT
[02:03:05] <North> YES, YES, THAT

[02:09:05] <Witchit> Back
[02:09:19] <North> o/
[02:09:21] <Witchit> What's up North o3o
[02:09:41] <North> I was just sharing an observation with a friend
[02:09:45] <North> on the subject of dreams
[02:09:53] <Witchit> Ohhh
[02:09:56] <Witchit> Dreams, right...
[02:10:09] <Witchit> What about them?
[02:10:19] <North> get a load of this:
[02:10:58] <North> I have noticed that a higher proportion of calories derived from animal products seems to produce violent, murderous dreams
[02:11:15] <North> which, of course, are disconcerting
[02:11:32] * North adds, lest anyone think him to be psychopathic
[02:11:58] <Witchit> Yikes...I didn't know that
[02:12:14] <Witchit> Though I think that may be an old wives' tale
[02:12:18] <Witchit> (In my case)
[02:12:35] <North> I've never heard that particular tale
[02:12:44] <North> if, in fact, it's a tale at all!
[02:12:49] <Witchit> XD
[02:13:28] <North> cause for wonder, at any rate
[02:13:50] <Witchit> But in all honestly, I'm fine even when eating meat. It's not really what I eat for me that causes the dreams :)
[02:13:57] <Witchit> Shoot give me a sec
[02:14:19] <North> no simple equation, I wager
[02:15:28] <Witchit> Back
[02:15:37] <Witchit> Sorry, I was in a phone call
[02:16:01] <Witchit> But is it like that for you North?
[02:16:09] <North> I suggest no further use of the 2-way radio, in any form
[02:16:34] <Witchit> Erm...
[02:16:36] <Witchit> XD
[02:16:40] <North> but yes
[02:16:45] <North> unsettlingly
[02:16:52] <North> I may go back to peanut butter
[02:17:11] * North eyes peanut butter making a show of open arms
[02:17:14] <Witchit> That's fine if you want
[02:17:32] <Witchit> You could also eat animal stuff, just less of it
[02:17:54] <North> that's about where I used to be
[02:18:06] <North> but I've since JACKED IT UP
[02:18:22] <North> eggs!
[02:18:25] <North> cheese!
[02:18:26] <Witchit> Then LESSEN IT DOWN
[02:18:28] <North> and so forth
[02:18:53] <North> your words contain a flavour of truth
[02:19:18] <North> Life: one great big teaching machine
[02:19:36] <Witchit> It's true. It's very, very true. ^ ^
[02:19:37] <North> so many wrong paths traveled
[02:20:17] <North> if only someone would step forth from the shadows, saying  "Expect this: it's part of the path."
[02:20:34] <Witchit> I would probably scream and run the other way :P
[02:20:37] <North> lol
[02:20:43] <North> better safe than sorry
[02:21:07] <Witchit> I gotta go now, dinner T^T
[02:21:08] <North> people lurking in the shadows being generally up to no good

[02:51:38] <MissSuugar> thank you

[02:51:46] <MissSuugar> i was actually thinking that we could make a forum

[02:52:00] <MissSuugar> so that people who wanted to practice could offer free readings
[02:52:02] <BansheeTears> Why not both

[02:53:47] <MissSuugar> it would be cool if the forums did post on the front page then people could see all the activity

[02:57:42] <BansheeTears> I missed that tidbit. Was looking at my fingers
[02:58:03] <BansheeTears> Nor you
[02:58:05] <Wolfbane> this movie is hilariously racist and politically incorrect
[02:58:14] <Wolfbane> so many racial stereotypes in one movie
[02:58:22] <Wolfbane> i haven't seen it
[02:58:22] <BansheeTears> North: ya tots grab an evp recorder and go back
[02:58:34] <BansheeTears> Ya otta *
[02:58:34] <Wolfbane> but man it looks bad, nostalgia critic reviewed it

[03:01:13] <North> <Crispywhisper>  "What say you we yank the plug on this egregious shit"
[03:01:13] <Wolfbane> seriously this review i just watched had me floored
[03:02:02] <BansheeTears> Crispy whispering: when someone eating popcorn next to you tries to whisper trivia in your ear, while still munching
[03:02:03] <Wolfbane> i can honestly say
[03:02:10] <Wolfbane> thats the first time ive even seen that word
[03:02:20] <BansheeTears> Especially in a dark theater

[03:04:44] <BansheeTears> You bad :p
[03:04:57] <MissSuugar> not like to the extent that they are crying 
[03:05:01] <BansheeTears> What's the worst movie ya ever saw
[03:05:03] <MissSuugar> just enough to make them uncomfortable

[03:06:02] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> BansheeTears, the worst movie I ever saw was "The Blair Witch Project"

[03:06:10] <Wolfbane> man i haven't had a kitkat in years
[03:06:22] <MissSuugar> and she tells me about these things because she knows i am an awful person and will come up with better ways to annoy them right back
[03:06:25] <BansheeTears> Lol!! That's lance and i's first movie
[03:06:38] <North> that computer fix thing is a scam
[03:06:54] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> When I walked out of it, I wanted my money and that time back.
[03:06:57] <North> my ex had dollars lifted from her account, as a result
[03:06:57] <MissSuugar> so i told her ok this is what you do, you start crying really softly at first confused start saying "its gone blue its bone blue"
[03:06:59] <BansheeTears> Ripd dept is one of mines
[03:07:13] <MissSuugar> then you amp it up and start freaking out screaming "its on fire!"

[03:08:44] <BansheeTears> That as just wrong
[03:08:44] <Wolfbane> that was rather offputting
[03:08:49] <BansheeTears> Def
[03:08:56] <Wolfbane> i liked his hair though
[03:08:57] <North> Sugar, your kicks are one of the sole redeeming features of this cheeseball of a planet

[03:09:40] <Wolfbane> i had a rather macabre sense of humour
[03:09:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yes, BansheeTears. I went to a theater. And my date was just as disappointed as I was.
[03:10:19] <North> those little chicken legs kicking...
[03:10:23] <BansheeTears> Lance still hates that flick
[03:10:24] <North> "They're NEW"
[03:10:28] <BansheeTears> It spooked him
[03:10:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I don't blame him
[03:10:35] <BansheeTears> Struck some nerve
[03:10:44] <North> yeah
[03:10:52] <North> no great hurry to revisit that thing
[03:11:10] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, it was advertised and hyped as if it were a real documentary, and it was totally bugus.
[03:11:15] <BansheeTears> Omg. My neighbor got a rooster.. I might not be vegan long.
[03:11:30] <Wolfbane> btw guys
[03:11:35] <Wolfbane> what are your tastes in music like
[03:11:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Varied, Wolfbane
[03:11:50] <Wolfbane> :)
[03:11:53] <BansheeTears> They should have got sued over false advertising :p
[03:11:54] <North> <Doony>  "Principles...vs. Blissful Silence...."  *pondering*
[03:12:13] <Wolfbane> BansheeTears: do u listen to much music?
[03:12:25] <Wolfbane> i have to say my old time favorite artist is pink floyd
[03:12:34] <Wolfbane> after all these years i still find em awesome
[03:12:34] <BansheeTears> Yea, mostly native, or tribal Celtic
[03:12:47] <Wolfbane> old-all
[03:12:58] <BansheeTears> I have a Celtic version of the wall
[03:13:04] <Wolfbane> oh wow
[03:13:07] <North> hmm
[03:13:16] <Wolfbane> thats cool!
[03:13:21] <BansheeTears> It's strange to hear.
[03:13:26] <Wolfbane> btw ive gotta ask something
[03:13:34] <Wolfbane> what do you think when you think electronic music
[03:13:41] <BansheeTears> Because so many memories are associated with the album for me
[03:13:42] <Wolfbane> what pops up
[03:13:59] *** SleepingAlari is now known as Alari
[03:14:18] <North> "Oooooooh, I need a dirty woman"  *dulcimer plinking away*
[03:14:27] <Wolfbane> hahaha
[03:14:29] <Wolfbane> young lust
[03:14:32] <Wolfbane> good tune
[03:14:44] <BansheeTears> Not sure... Mostly I think of Yamaha keyboards
[03:14:54] <North> electronic music emcompasses rather a broad spectrum
[03:15:01] <Wolfbane> not modular synths or kraftwerk?
[03:15:09] <BansheeTears> You can't have any pudding if ya don't eat your meat!!
[03:15:29] <Wolfbane> everyone thinks of that when they think pink floyd bwahhaa
[03:15:49] <Wolfbane> the whole album is brilliant though
[03:15:51] <BansheeTears> I used to have that movie memorized
[03:15:53] <Wolfbane> not one shit song
[03:15:58] <Wolfbane> yes
[03:16:01] <Wolfbane> the movie kicks ass
[03:16:15] <BansheeTears> Brilliant film
[03:16:18] <Wolfbane> comfortably numb...
[03:16:24] <Wolfbane> such an awesome tune
[03:16:30] <BansheeTears> I like the trial sequence
[03:16:39] <Wolfbane> yuh :)
[03:16:44] <Wolfbane> thats ones got spots!!!
[03:16:52] <Wolfbane> get him against the wall!!!
[03:17:01] <BansheeTears> Classic
[03:17:11] <Wolfbane> you know
[03:17:18] <Wolfbane> that album broke floyd in two
[03:17:25] <BansheeTears> Come to mamma baby let me hold you in my arms.......
[03:17:37] <Wolfbane> rodger waters vs david glimour
[03:17:46] <BansheeTears> That would have been a great show to see
[03:17:49] <North> sad scene
[03:17:52] <North> with the pet rat
[03:17:54] <North> or whatever
[03:18:02] <Wolfbane> hmm the pet rat?
[03:18:03] <BansheeTears> Omg I cry every time
[03:18:03] *** Joins: agent199 (agent199@sorcery-6trrnp.eastlink.ca)
[03:18:05] <Abraxas> Welcome, agent199. Enlightenment doesn't occur from sitting around visualizing images of light, but from integrating the darker aspects of the self into the conscious personality.
[03:18:17] <North> been years since I've seen it
[03:18:22] <BansheeTears> When he tried to save it...
[03:18:28] <Wolfbane> i cannot remember the pet rat... oh yes
[03:18:29] * North nods
[03:18:31] <Wolfbane> and it dies
[03:18:34] <North> was it a rat?
[03:18:36] <Wolfbane> :(
[03:18:39] <Wolfbane> i think so
[03:18:41] <Wolfbane> its hard to tell
[03:18:46] <Wolfbane> if i recall
[03:18:47] <BansheeTears> A large rat I think
[03:18:51] <North> smart l'il critters
[03:18:51] <Wolfbane> yup
[03:18:54] <Wolfbane> i own rats
[03:18:57] <Wolfbane> 2 of em
[03:19:07] <BansheeTears> Rats are cool
[03:19:17] <Wolfbane> i mean you can cage a rat but you cannot cage its curiousity
[03:19:18] <North> something to announce to the world, via t-shirt slogan
[03:19:22] <BansheeTears> Used to have one too
[03:19:32] <Wolfbane> as soon as i take em out they run around sniffing things and getting into weird places
[03:19:49] <BansheeTears> Brb
[03:19:59] <Wolfbane> North: lol, nah
[03:20:16] <Wolfbane> unless it was done in the coca cola font
[03:20:21] <North> go to hell, World, if you don't get it
[03:20:38] <Wolfbane> yep
[03:20:45] <Wolfbane> go to hell would be nice on the back
[03:20:46] <Wolfbane> :)
[03:21:09] <Wolfbane> front "i love rats" back "screw you too"
[03:21:35] <Wolfbane> its so screwed up that everythings so PC these days
[03:21:39] <BansheeTears> Love vultures too
[03:21:40] <Wolfbane> that its overblown
[03:21:56] <Wolfbane> like anything too expressionistic is squashed
[03:22:07] <Wolfbane> by small minded individuals
[03:22:25] * North imagines Doony wearing a t-shirt depicting vulture's guts-encrusted face
[03:22:28] <Wolfbane> like theres many t-shirts i'd love to wear
[03:22:33] <North> caption: "Kiss me, I'm Irish"
[03:22:34] <Wolfbane> but i wouldn't
[03:22:38] <BansheeTears> Lol!!!!!!
[03:22:45] <BansheeTears> I'd so wear that!
[03:22:49] <North> lol
[03:22:49] <Wolfbane> North: whoa... vivid
[03:23:02] <Wolfbane> i just want a t-shirt of ash from the evil dead
[03:23:04] <Wolfbane> :)
[03:23:10] <BansheeTears> Vultures are bald for a reason
[03:23:15] <North> makes sense
[03:23:26] <BansheeTears> So they don't get guts in their head feathers
[03:23:34] <Wolfbane> hah
[03:23:35] <North> good thinkin', Nature
[03:23:49] <Wolfbane> little friar tucks
[03:23:55] <BansheeTears> Did you know they're some of the best gliders on the planet?
[03:23:57] <Wolfbane> chewing on intestines
[03:24:05] <North> I had no idea
[03:24:13] <Wolfbane> hmm that would make sense
[03:24:16] <Wolfbane> since they circle
[03:24:17] <BansheeTears> Can go for an hour or two without flapping
[03:24:25] <North> just hangin' around, waiting for stuff to die
[03:24:37] <Wolfbane> in the desert conserving energy seems like a great idea
[03:24:39] <BansheeTears> Yup
[03:24:56] <BansheeTears> A great metaphor for life
[03:25:04] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Great thermals to ride in the desert
[03:25:15] <Wolfbane> only flap when u need to flap - BansheeTears 
[03:25:25] <BansheeTears> Oh too true ArchrWndrMcRbrt
[03:25:36] <Wolfbane> the rising hot air
[03:25:42] <Wolfbane> from the sun baked surface
[03:26:01] <North> <Vulture>   "Dead yet?"   <Still-Living Carcass> *weakly stirring*   <Vulture>  "FFS" *glancing at 'wrist' watch, causing it to stall and dive*
[03:26:02] <Wolfbane> you know one thing i am grateful for
[03:26:18] <Wolfbane> is that we don't really have a scorpian issue here in australia at least the part im in
[03:26:30] <Wolfbane> scorpion -
[03:26:40] <BansheeTears> Lol North  XD
[03:27:03] <BansheeTears> Scores glow purple under a black light
[03:27:07] <BansheeTears> Scorps
[03:27:08] <Wolfbane> North: make that a meme.
[03:27:11] <Wolfbane> do it.
[03:27:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That's why gliders and sailplanes are able to stay up much longer and travel further in the Southwest part of the country. All the desert areas there.
[03:27:52] <Wolfbane> hmm
[03:27:56] <Wolfbane> perfect song for the occasion
[03:28:10] <North> <Dustdevils>  "Thanks, rising columns of air!"
[03:28:11] <BansheeTears> There's a very sad pic of a vulture waiting for a kid to die.. The guy who took the pic never got over it.. He committed suicide
[03:28:12] <Wolfbane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVhNCTH8pDs
[03:28:24] <North> those things can throw patio furniture around pretty good, I hear
[03:28:40] <BansheeTears> We have great tubular ones here
[03:28:43] <North> jeez, Wids
[03:29:07] <BansheeTears> True, guy won the Pulitzer or something for it
[03:29:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The favorite Irishman of so many suburbanites: Paddy O'Furniture.
[03:29:16] <BansheeTears> But it haunted him to death
[03:29:25] <North> understandably
[03:29:33] <Wolfbane> oh my
[03:29:40] <Wolfbane> a young david glimour there
[03:29:51] <BansheeTears> ArchrWndrMcRbrt:  Óêâ

[03:30:41] <BansheeTears> What's the most haunting pic you ever saw?
[03:31:25] <Wolfbane> you know what sucks
[03:31:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Tough question
[03:31:37] * SpiritSong waves
[03:31:43] <MissSuugar> vacuums?
[03:31:53] * ArchrWndrMcRbrt hugs SpiritSong
[03:32:01] * North allos the Juli-elf
[03:32:03] <Wolfbane> birds have the ability to soar and fly like the winds but lack the capacity and depth of intellect to really appreciate it as a human would
[03:32:07] * SpiritSong huggles BansheeTears ArchrWndrMcRbrt North and MissSuugar ^_^ <3
[03:32:21] <SpiritSong> how is everyone
[03:32:30] <North> intellect may be more of an encumbrance than anything else
[03:32:39] <BansheeTears> But they also see things we take for granted
[03:32:49] <BansheeTears> True North
[03:32:57] <BansheeTears> http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/photography/articles/2845/title/kevin-carter-consequences-photojournalism
[03:32:58] * North snugs the silverbirdy
[03:33:06] <Wolfbane> thats true... i suppose you are right... to everything there is a balance... except in our broken hearts
[03:33:10] <BansheeTears> Sad story and pic
[03:33:13] <BansheeTears> Be warned
[03:33:15] * SpiritSong snugs the north
[03:33:16] <Wolfbane> humans destroy far too easily
[03:33:25] <BansheeTears> Huggles SpiritSong !
[03:33:38] <SpiritSong> <3 BansheeTears
[03:33:43] * Wolfbane wonders where his hugs are :(
[03:33:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Cheyenne Autumn, BansheeTears. That one had me looking at the stories of the Old West from a differant perspective.
[03:34:07] <Wolfbane> oh well, noone loves me haha
[03:34:12] <BansheeTears> Got a link?
[03:34:23] <BansheeTears> Hugs Wolfbane  :)
[03:34:32] * SpiritSong hugs wolf
[03:34:39] <BansheeTears> Once I hugged someone and they blew up at me
[03:34:41] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I now look at ALL old Westerns differantly, actually.
[03:34:46] <Wolfbane> aww
[03:34:47] <Wolfbane> thanks 
[03:34:48] <SpiritSong> im shy about hugging people i dont know
[03:34:51] <SpiritSong> its not personal
[03:34:54] <BansheeTears> Same here
[03:35:02] <Wolfbane> SpiritSong: its ok... you'll get to know me as the awesome guy i am
[03:35:12] <Wolfbane> believe me when i say i am a pretty good bloke
[03:35:14] <BansheeTears> And humble too
[03:35:19] <SpiritSong> lol!
[03:35:24] <Wolfbane> well yea maybe not "humble"
[03:35:32] <Wolfbane> but still...
[03:35:36] <SpiritSong> well cant wait to see ya prove it ;)
[03:35:48] <Wolfbane> apparently rumours have been spread around
[03:35:52] <BansheeTears> Is Cheyenne Autumn the name of a picture?
[03:36:01] <Wolfbane> widdershins approached me about it
[03:36:17] <North> why do you suppose?
[03:36:23] <Wolfbane> believe me those rumours are unfounded and created by hating people... who only see me as a threat to their power base
[03:36:35] <North> hmm
[03:36:45] <SpiritSong> well, nows your chance to prove so
[03:36:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yes, BansheeTears. Richard Widmark
[03:36:48] <North> time will tell, I suppose
[03:36:48] <BansheeTears> Time will tell all truths
[03:36:54] <Wolfbane> or
[03:36:57] <North> jinx!
[03:36:59] <BansheeTears> Lol North !
[03:37:00] <Wolfbane> time makes fools of us all.

[03:43:35] <Wolfbane> im interested in bugs and plants

[03:44:04] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ok
[03:44:08] <North> I've heard tell that even *squirrels* are venomous, down under
[03:44:08] <Wolfbane> brissie is in queensland
[03:44:25] <Wolfbane> BansheeTears: i'm afraid if i study insects it will also have to be arachnids 
[03:44:31] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I know that, Wolfbane. I was there in 2003
[03:44:34] * SpiritSong is freezing cold
[03:44:44] <Wolfbane> oh ok?
[03:44:48] <Wolfbane> what was the reason ArchrWndrMcRbrt 
[03:44:49] * ArchrWndrMcRbrt hugs SpiritSong
[03:44:56] * SpiritSong hugs ArchrWndrMcRbrt
[03:44:59] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Visiting a sheila 
[03:45:05] <BansheeTears> Truth Wolfbane
[03:45:06] * North adds Official Canadian Thermal Socks to Birdy's feets
[03:45:17] <SpiritSong> lol
[03:45:19] <Wolfbane> ah rightio ArchrWndrMcRbrt where are you from?
[03:45:21] <SpiritSong> aww ty north
[03:45:24] <North> o/
[03:45:35] <Wolfbane> North: is that what the mounties wear?
[03:45:35] <BansheeTears> Wool socks.. A must have for all good Irish ladies
[03:45:37] <Wolfbane> :3
[03:45:46] <SpiritSong> :P
[03:45:50] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Milwaukee, Wisconsin USA. And, no, I never met Jeffery Dahmer.
[03:45:54] * SpiritSong knits up a pair
[03:46:09] <BansheeTears> ^5's
[03:46:14] <Wolfbane> i really like mounties heheh
[03:46:19] <Wolfbane> they sound so cool
[03:46:27] <SpiritSong> ^5s
[03:46:37] <North> Mounties rely on a steady diet of pure alcohol to keep their stupid faces from freezing off
[03:46:37] <Wolfbane> i wonder what being a mountie would be like
[03:46:41] <BansheeTears> I never got past dudley doright
[03:46:46] <Wolfbane> ohh gotcha North 
[03:47:02] <North> antifreeze, if you will
[03:47:02] <Wolfbane> dahmer? serial killer?
[03:47:25] <BansheeTears> Did he get put down?
[03:47:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I got asked that a lot while I was there, if I'd ever met him.
[03:47:37] <Wolfbane> let me look into this
[03:48:08] <Wolfbane> wow
[03:48:09] <Wolfbane> yep
[03:48:10] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yes, BansheeTears. He was beaten to death in prison by another inmate.
[03:48:12] <Wolfbane> serial killer
[03:48:22] <Wolfbane> good 
[03:48:24] <BansheeTears> Ahh.. Hate to say it , but good
[03:49:00] <BansheeTears> Least he's not being adored by these weird or serial killer groupies
[03:49:06] <Wolfbane> you knwo this mind be a bit of a heavy topic
[03:49:09] <Wolfbane> but
[03:49:20] <Wolfbane> killing domestically versus as a soldier 
[03:49:29] <Wolfbane> both are wrong right... thats true
[03:49:29] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The families of Dahmer's victims sent the guy cards and gifts, and some offered to help pay for his lwyer.
[03:49:30] <Wolfbane> but
[03:49:33] <SpiritSong> creepy
[03:49:44] <Wolfbane> sometimes required by the soldier
[03:49:47] <BansheeTears> That's creepy
[03:49:49] <Wolfbane> in a good cause
[03:50:06] <Wolfbane> yea ArchrWndrMcRbrt thats weird
[03:50:08] <Wolfbane> :\
[03:50:23] <BansheeTears> Killing to me is a hard subject
[03:50:29] <Wolfbane> but you know what im saying like... a soldier gets paid to kill.
[03:50:39] <Wolfbane> its all about the morals and ethics involved
[03:50:44] <BansheeTears> I see it for self defense, but not condone it for acquisition
[03:50:51] <Wolfbane> but politics messes things up
[03:50:58] <Wolfbane> yes
[03:51:15] <Wolfbane> self defense... but then im all for hanging the bastards
[03:51:27] <Wolfbane> if anyone kills unprovoked 
[03:51:33] <Wolfbane> or indisciminately
[03:51:44] <BansheeTears> There's a lot of innocent folks on death row in America
[03:51:50] <Wolfbane> or for sport or whatever deranged motive they have
[03:51:51] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> As Clint Eastwood's character in "Unforgiven" said, "It's a hell of a thing, killin' a man. You take away everything he is, and everything he was ever gonna be."
[03:51:56] <SpiritSong> i dont see how killing them makes upn for what they did
[03:52:02] <Wolfbane> BansheeTears: true :( the justice system needs to be fixed
[03:52:14] <Wolfbane> imho it just removes that threat from the community
[03:52:18] <SpiritSong> i think locking them up so they can never hurt another is enaough tbh
[03:52:24] <Wolfbane> and makes the neighbourhood a safe place
[03:52:24] <BansheeTears> Till the proof is irrefutable I say life
[03:52:27] <SpiritSong> killing them creates more hate
[03:52:32] <Wolfbane> its like putting down a rabid dog who bites
[03:52:34] <SpiritSong> agreed BansheeTears
[03:52:42] <North> with "It's A Small World" playing on a speaker in their cell
[03:52:44] <North> forever
[03:52:52] <Wolfbane> hahah North 
[03:52:56] <BansheeTears> Yup!!
[03:53:14] <Wolfbane> maybe life in prison 
[03:53:18] <Wolfbane> but you know in america alone
[03:53:24] <Wolfbane> which has 222 million people
[03:53:31] <Wolfbane> 1 percent is jail
[03:53:36] <Wolfbane> thats 2 million people
[03:53:39] <BansheeTears> There have been a few people just lately cleared after 17 years in solitary on death row
[03:53:45] <Wolfbane> is in jail-
[03:53:55] <Wolfbane> BansheeTears: ouch
[03:53:58] <Wolfbane> thats nasty
[03:54:01] <Wolfbane> poor bastards
[03:54:17] <BansheeTears> Was listening too one guys story on npr
[03:54:26] <Wolfbane> yea... if only there was a simpler way
[03:54:26] <BansheeTears> Sad
[03:55:05] <BansheeTears> Prison can be more geared to reform and skill building, ... For non violent offenders
[03:55:24] <Wolfbane> rigorous psycho analysing
[03:55:34] <BansheeTears> Containment for violent ones and maybe therapy and mental help for those with illness
[03:55:53] <Wolfbane> yea
[03:55:55] <Wolfbane> :(
[03:56:02] <Wolfbane> it sucks that people are just wired badly hey
[03:56:05] <SpiritSong> yup you gott it BansheeTears
[03:56:07] <BansheeTears> Jail could be much more constructive
[03:56:17] <Wolfbane> i mean damn... john lennon's death
[03:56:24] <Wolfbane> how freakin horrible was that
[03:56:46] <BansheeTears> John Lennon was a gift
[03:56:57] <Wolfbane> unfortunately theres a darker side to lennon
[03:57:03] <BansheeTears> So we're many others too, ones who never got famous
[03:57:06] <Wolfbane> he was a horrible husband and father
[03:57:23] <Wolfbane> ive seen documentries
[03:57:26] <BansheeTears> Ghanaian had a dark side too
[03:57:32] <BansheeTears> Ghandi
[03:57:35] <Wolfbane> yep
[03:57:41] <Wolfbane> thats true
[03:57:47] <Wolfbane> it sucks hey
[03:57:56] <Wolfbane> all the great people seem to be tainted
[03:58:14] <BansheeTears> Put that any stresses, fame, and responsibility on a man and something will snap
[03:58:18] <BansheeTears> It's human
[03:58:24] <Wolfbane> our heros are flawed but its ok we all are
[03:58:49] <BansheeTears> Doesn't make it ok, but it's still human
[03:59:02] <Wolfbane> i kinda wish the armchair politics of that would resound as bittersweet in the mouths of the overly critical media who pump the masses full of hate
[03:59:37] <Wolfbane> on social media though we are so critical of each other when we fall from grace
[03:59:46] <Wolfbane> its really damning these days
[03:59:57] <BansheeTears> There's too much grouping, too much celebrity worship
[04:00:04] <Wolfbane> you rise, but when you fall noones there to catch you
[04:00:12] <Wolfbane> well...
[04:00:20] <Wolfbane> people do need others to set examples
[04:00:23] <BansheeTears> Look at the Berber
[04:00:23] <Wolfbane> we need great people
[04:00:30] <Wolfbane> to lead us in different directions
[04:00:32] <Wolfbane> well
[04:00:33] <BansheeTears> Beiber
[04:00:41] <Wolfbane> hes just a spoilt brat
[04:00:58] <BansheeTears> And folks seem to think trump is that person lately
[04:01:05] <Wolfbane> he needs good clip up the side of the ear
[04:01:05] <BansheeTears> It's scares me
[04:01:21] <Wolfbane> ooo
[04:01:23] <Wolfbane> that turd
[04:01:25] <Wolfbane> :(
[04:01:41] <BansheeTears> Somethings gonna give
[04:01:49] <Wolfbane> trump as president = ww3
[04:01:54] <Wolfbane> no if's or but's
[04:02:13] <BansheeTears> He's scary for sure
[04:02:26] <BansheeTears> There will be riots
[04:02:34] <Wolfbane> :(
[04:02:38] <Wolfbane> i am very worried
[04:02:49] <Wolfbane> i just don't think people are that hating in their hearts
[04:02:49] <BansheeTears> many in the world are
[04:02:59] <Wolfbane> yea
[04:03:04] <Wolfbane> its justified 
[04:03:08] <Wolfbane> hes a psychopath
[04:03:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Remember that, in British slang, "trump" is "fart". Which is appropriate, since a fart is bad smelling hot air being expelled by an a$$hole.
[04:03:38] <BansheeTears> Lol!!!!!!!!

[05:00:12] <MissSuugar> you decided to sit on the floor and drink juice?
[05:00:14] <North> and that guy appearing, zombily asking "Is that juice?"

[05:00:26] * North unnecessarily reviews
[05:00:49] <North> I totally understand the tears

[05:01:19] <MissSuugar> ohhhh
[05:01:26] <MissSuugar> well ignore them
[05:01:32] <North> done
[05:01:42] <North> here's what happened in the grocery store, btw:
[05:02:17] <North> a little girl was climbing down from a supermarket cart, piloted by her daddy
[05:02:39] <MissSuugar> ok
[05:02:43] <North> suddenly, a female acquaintance of theirs approaches

[05:50:13] <MissSuugar> unfortunately sometimes we gotta do what our parents want when we are under their roof
[05:50:35] <MissSuugar> not like outrageous stuff but making peace when they are paying the bills and putting clothes on our backs
[05:50:50] <SpiritSong> i think thats a different emily
[05:50:52] <North> <-- watching a thunderstorm while under his own roof

[07:15:09] <Emily2> Spiritually yes but no
[07:15:51] <MissSuugar> mothers worry about their children, she wants you to socially fit in, a dress like that isnt going to do that, she wants you to have a good upbringing so she worries about this wiccan thing that you are into
[07:16:26] <MissSuugar> she isnt doing this to punish you or make you feel bad about yourself, she wants you to be well adjusted by the time you leave home, to be able to fit in with other people and go forward in life
[07:16:55] <Emily2> forcing me to.go to a church being with teens that threatened to burn me
[07:17:26] <MissSuugar> of course she wants you to go to church your mortal soul is a very real thing to her
[07:17:39] <MissSuugar> and of course she is afraid for you
[07:18:11] <Emily2> I'm a wiccan and that's who I am
[07:18:20] <MissSuugar> thats who you are now
[07:18:42] <Emily2> Its who I will be in the future
[07:19:07] <Raggiedmon> Following a non normal path is likly to get attacks, as much as it upsets you, you sorta need to devlop a thicker skin, sorta shurg off things that hurt, take a few breaths accept that your not getting understood maybe try an explain your veiw in a logical way
[07:19:08] <MissSuugar> things change as we progress in life, you wont be the same person 7 years from now, maybe you will find a different path who knows, but you dont see what she sees because you are a teenager
[07:19:38] <MissSuugar> and right now you are thinking of your hurt feelings and not her overwhelming worry for you
[07:19:45] <Emily2> I been a wiccan for almost five years missugar
[07:19:53] <MissSuugar> that doesnt matter
[07:20:02] <Emily2> I'm not changing
[07:20:08] <MissSuugar> thats not the point
[07:20:22] <Emily2> My heart is set on this path and this path only I know I won't change
[07:20:28] <MissSuugar> the point is what you are experiencing and what she is experiencing are 2 different things
[07:21:09] <MissSuugar> and in order to go forward on the path you have choosen you have to be able to see past your ego
[07:21:24] <Emily2> I don't have an ego
[07:21:25] <MissSuugar> you have to be able to let it go, and see things from all sides
[07:21:30] <MissSuugar> that is your ego speaking
[07:21:34] <MissSuugar> thats what the ego is
[07:21:48] <MissSuugar> the ego is not thinking you are better than other people
[07:21:50] <Emily2> I should know if I don't have one
[07:22:26] <Emily2> I don't think others any less.
[07:22:35] <MissSuugar> thats not the ego either
[07:22:42] <MissSuugar> everyone has an ego
[07:22:58] <MissSuugar> it doesnt make you any less of a person
[07:23:18] <Emily2> OK
[07:24:05] <MissSuugar> everyone has thoughts of "i dont have to change its everyone else with the problem" it hides in your mind, it acts like  your best friend, convincing you that you are fine the way you are, that you dont have to grow or change
[07:24:20] <Emily2> My teacher called me a dissapointment and all my mom said was you should t have rushed the test and I wrote 15 paragraphs about plastic bottles and nature
[07:24:22] <MissSuugar> it hides as your own self talk
[07:24:37] <MissSuugar> either as a destructive force, or a force to stay the same fearing change
[07:25:01] <MissSuugar> the ego isnt "im better than everyone else" the ego is "im perfect the way i am now"
[07:25:35] <MissSuugar> and letting go of that is very difficult, it takes many many years of self exploration and self analysis 
[07:25:50] <Emily2> My mind always says try to be good enough...be this weight...be this person..hide who u really are
[07:26:08] <MissSuugar> to get to the core of who you are, to get to your higher mind and say "i am an ever evolving soul on my own path"
[07:26:16] <MissSuugar> that is your ego
[07:26:43] <Emily2> I am on my own journey with a path lol

[07:27:42] <Emily2> At least the professors treat you like a human
[07:27:52] <MissSuugar> letting go of negativity isnt easy, but you also have to own it, sit down for a moment before you react to others and say "is this how it really is, or am i seeing it differently because i am being defensive, how will this impact my life,"
[07:28:29] * Emily2 hides in a shell.
[07:28:35] <MissSuugar> if those other words really mean nothing to you, then feel bad for the person who is saying them, because their negativity will overwhelm them someday and they will be a very sad person
[07:28:43] <Emily2> This is how I always am ^
[07:28:59] <Emily2> True
[07:29:16] <MissSuugar> however i really think that before you go any further you need to sit down with your mother, and have an adult conversation with her about your feelings
[07:29:32] <Emily2> I just don't want to be forced to believe in something I don't .misssugar.
[07:29:42] <MissSuugar> write down all the things you want to say to her, and then very calmly tell her these things
[07:30:01] <MissSuugar> she may respect your decisions more for having made the effort to have a conversation
[07:30:06] <Emily2> No....bad idea
[07:30:20] <Emily2> No...bad idea...very bad idea
[07:30:22] <MissSuugar> and if she gets upset, dont get upset in return, stay calm and let her have her feelings
[07:30:32] <MissSuugar> she is allowed to have them
[07:30:39] <MissSuugar> and try again at another date
[07:30:53] <MissSuugar> how you react to other people is half the battle
[07:31:17] <MissSuugar> by getting more upset than the person who is getting upset will only escalate that problem
[07:31:35] <MissSuugar> if you are able to stay calm and collected you can bring a conversation back down to a calm space
[07:31:41] <Emily2> I know she's allowed to have feeling and so am I..she never listens to my feelings she just does even if it means letting me sleep all day and come out with cuts all over myself because she hurt me down to the core.
[07:32:20] <Emily2> I talked to a therapist about that
[07:33:18] <Emily2> I'm pissed at her for many many things I won't be able to let go of
[07:33:19] <MissSuugar> harming yourself is not the answer
[07:33:28] <MissSuugar> that will only make more problems in the end
[07:33:51] <MissSuugar> if you want to be respected in your decision making you have to make the right ones
[07:34:13] <Emily2> I don't.harm.anymore
[07:34:19] <MissSuugar> thats good
[07:34:43] <Emily2> Haven't in 5 years.
[07:35:35] <MissSuugar> the next step is to have a conversation that is mature and understanding, when your mother says something to you, you respond with "I hear what you are saying, this is how I feel"
[07:35:57] <MissSuugar> by using "I" statements you are able to have a conversation that doesnt feel like you are accusing 
[07:36:24] <MissSuugar> and it puts the pressure on the other person to respond in kind
[07:36:46] <MissSuugar> by having these sorts of conversation you can move forward in your spirituality and in your life
[07:37:49] <Emily2> Maybe she shouldn't let me stand at the side of the rode puking and crap running down my legs when she drops me off at school and the whole school is watching and she leaves you there miserable and comes back and picks u up and makes being sick a punishment
[07:38:29] <MissSuugar> then that is abuse
[07:38:46] <Emily2> Look I'm in foster care
[07:38:51] <Emily2> I'm used to it
[07:39:41] <MissSuugar> then its up to you to decide how you will go forward
[07:40:53] <Emily2> We do fun stuff...great family...its just my over sensitivity to everything that makes it hell in me
[07:41:35] <MissSuugar> that is great
[07:42:04] <Emily2> I try not to make it hell in them but when it comes to spiritual then its hell
[07:42:21] <MissSuugar> then maybe make a compromise 
[07:42:28] <Emily2> We did
[07:42:47] <MissSuugar> great
[07:43:13] <Emily2> I stay wiccan and only talk about it with my doctors and friends...while at home they don't hear or see it...I GI to church still.
[07:44:03] <MissSuugar> well maybe talk to your social worker about the church thing and see if they can intervene 
[07:44:34] <Emily2> One day on Monday. I felt a rush of spiritual energy.I felt happy and soothed rolling around in the grass
[07:44:54] <Emily2> Then...I felt sad..for a while and I kept hearing a call
[07:45:29] <Emily2> Idk what it was but it was like ..I wana be near people who r witches...I want to be in a coven
[07:46:30] <Emily2> I tried to ignore it at school but I felt a rush and today I had a conversation with the goddess
[07:46:34] <Emily2> Now I feel okay again
[07:46:35] <MissSuugar> well i hope you get to a place where you can be in a good community
[07:46:55] <Emily2> :)
