[02:00:29] <MissSugar> cant complain
[02:00:31] <MissSugar> hows you
[02:00:32] <Pores> My friends like to avoid TV when they have other things in life in mind, as TV is seen as a distraction, or some sort of damper

[02:12:17] <North> you have the floor, Hraf
[02:12:38] <North> subjectivity, for starters
[02:12:45] <Hrafnbjorn> and is that illusion tim eitself, or the measurement of time?
[02:12:59] <Pores> I said stop baiting me :P
[02:13:10] <North> inextricably linked, I submit
[02:13:26] <Pores> Try a nice response instead
[02:13:27] <North> Pores, please
[02:13:30] <North> we've moved on
[02:13:38] <Pores> I'm not even a part of it!
[02:13:46] <North> good heavens
[02:13:54] <Hrafnbjorn> we can prove the existence of time, the measiurement of it is where it becomes subjective
[02:14:14] <North> as might our experience of anything
[02:14:25] <Pores> Stop baiting me to get banned, please. If you'd like giving nice response, that would be optimal
[02:14:28] <Hrafnbjorn> or I suppose instead of measurement, I shouls say thre experience of it
[02:14:45] <Hrafnbjorn> move on Pores, please
[02:15:03] <Pores> There is no need, because I wasn't frustrated or hung up on it in the first place
[02:15:36] <North> go watch 'Lost Girl'
[02:15:39] <Pores> I am asking him to stop doing something he's still doing :/
[02:16:14] <North> my subjective experience of time suggests to me that this is water under the bridge
[02:16:40] <Hrafnbjorn> the fact that we must use math to reconcile the difference it time passage according to proximity to gravity source (and would have to do same for speed) is good proof of times existence IMO... the experience of time is a totaly different thing though.  As a child a minute seems like an eternity, as ya get older it feels like less and less time

[02:26:07] <Pores> I wonder who it could be then
[02:26:41] <Hrafnbjorn> dogs are the most likely animal to develope speech, so I wouldnt be surprised if they will in the future
[02:27:24] <North> Clifford Simak wrote on that, I think
[02:27:32] <Hrafnbjorn> they only need to evolve cheeks, then they will have all the necessary mental, and physical things
[02:27:48] <North> what of cats?
[02:28:12] <Pores> Maybe they lived in Kansas before
[02:28:15] <Hrafnbjorn> cats dont have certain mental, and social attributes
[02:28:30] <North> certainly true, the latter

[02:28:52] <Hrafnbjorn> at least if anthropologists are right about how speech evolved

[02:29:56] * North nods, recalling his own doggy interactions
[02:30:09] <Pores> I sense where you live is somewhere really grounded, but similar to a tomb at a Pyramid
[02:30:20] <North> ...
[02:30:54] <North> see, this is why tv is so bad for people
[02:31:03] <North> like being forcefed Twinkies
[02:31:12] <Pores> The image of a intricate black vase comes to mind on what seems to be a black altar
[02:31:20] <Pores> So you are avoiding TV for the sake of mental health
[02:31:28] <Hrafnbjorn> Terrance Trent (sp?), the canid teacher for Disney pictures, was convinced that dogs are psychic... I think that could be extended to most social animals though, and I think cats as well
[02:32:23] <North> ordinary consciousness, below the tip of the iceberg, perhaps
[02:32:35] * Hrafnbjorn nods

[03:06:36] <MissSugar> so i just lost my wiener dog
[03:06:46] <XFrozenWitchX> wiener dog lol
[03:06:52] <XFrozenWitchX> sorry sorry haha
[03:06:54] <MissSugar> but then he was on the couch behind my head
[03:07:00] <North> lol
[03:07:05] <North> love those happy endings
[03:07:15] <MissSugar> he is a chiwienie 
[03:07:28] <North> curious
[03:07:39] <MissSugar> so he shakes a lot and is really nervous most of the time
[03:07:41] <Quad> a mutt of the 2 yappiest breeds
[03:07:57] <North> who wouldn't be, in a world of giants
[03:08:19] <XFrozenWitchX> I figured out why small dogs shake lol
[03:08:19] <MissSugar> thats why i let him on the back of the couch so he can see the whole living room
[03:08:27] <XFrozenWitchX> They don't sh*t half the time xD
[03:08:42] <MissSugar> his name is beans
[03:09:02] <North> and why not
[03:09:04] <North> :)
[03:09:05] <MissSugar> LOL
[03:09:06] <CantSirDraggin> don't let him have any of his namesake
[03:09:10] <Keith> weiners and beans
[03:09:14] <Quad> do you have a fat one named pork?
[03:09:17] <XFrozenWitchX> Omg the irony
[03:09:18] <XFrozenWitchX> LOL
[03:09:47] <MissSugar> No we actually got him from an old couple who had 2 dogs the other one was named franke
[03:09:50] <MissSugar> *frank
[03:10:03] <Keith> hehe
[03:10:05] <Quad> lol
[03:10:05] <XFrozenWitchX> I want to name two dogs Mike and Ike
[03:10:06] <Quad> win
[03:10:11] <MissSugar> LOL
[03:12:17] <MissSugar> my goal is to one day have a pig named petunia 
[03:12:37] <XFrozenWitchX> Where would you put a pig lol
[03:12:43] <Hrafnbjorn> I love pigs, and goats
[03:12:55] <North> goats have those strange, awful eyes, though
[03:12:56] <MissSugar> pigs are adorable and crazy smart
[03:13:06] <Hrafnbjorn> I wanna get some, but I would have to also get either llama or guard dogs to have them here
[03:13:08] <MissSugar> yeah they really have eyes straight from the pits of hell
[03:13:23] <North> llamas are apparently excellent for that
[03:13:23] <XFrozenWitchX> Goats have beards lol it's amusing.
[03:13:34] <North> no word of a lie, Sugarpants
[03:13:56] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah lllamas are great guard animals
[03:14:15] <XFrozenWitchX> Sarcasm or serious? lol
[03:14:26] <North> true thing
[03:14:35] <XFrozenWitchX> I was thinking more along the lines of a big dog ;)
[03:15:00] <North> imagine how terrifying a llama with a top hat strapped to its head would be to a trespasser
[03:15:09] <MissSugar> llamas can be mean though
[03:15:25] <XFrozenWitchX> They sure can. They spit like hell lol
[03:15:31] <MissSugar> oh yeah the spit
[03:15:42] <North> like in Jurassic Park
[03:15:43] <MissSugar> gross and painful
[03:15:50] <XFrozenWitchX> Oh yeah, I had a llama spit on me once lol
[03:15:58] <North> IT BURNS
[03:16:56] <Hrafnbjorn> the problem with guard dogs here is that youd have to have more than one, cause of bears... llamas being large are a visual deterant to the bears.  A single dog can easily handle the mountain lions though
[03:17:32] *** XFrozenWitchX is now known as XCuteWitchX-Awaaay
[03:17:34] <North> providing that dog wasn't a chiwienie

[04:01:43] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Did you see my posting about the gun?
[04:01:57] <DarkWitch> yeah I did, that's too funny

[04:02:32] <Abraxas> Welcome, n2157. Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.
[04:02:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I immediately thought of that. "Trust my Mom to have a Barbie gun."
[04:03:01] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa n2157!
[04:03:16] <DarkWitch> I had forgotten that line, but you are right, that's probably what the author had in mind when she described the gun - lol
[04:03:27] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> hehehe
[04:04:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Wecome, n2157
[04:04:44] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> i loved "Fire Touched", by the way. My youngest is enjoying it, now.
[04:05:22] <DarkWitch> cool, I'm glad I could send it to you, I ordered it completely by accident - lol
[04:06:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I was telling my youngest about that, and she said, "That's cool for you, Daddy!  You gonna let me borrow it when you're done?"
[04:06:44] <DarkWitch> lol, of course
[04:06:58] <Hrafnbjorn> is it a book?
[04:07:09] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> As if I could say "No" to my little girl, and her as big a fan as I am.
[04:07:18] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yes, Hrafnbjorn

[04:07:36] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The author's name is Patricia Briggs
[04:07:44] <Hrafnbjorn> groovy :)
[04:08:03] <DarkWitch> Hrafnbjorn, I ordered a hard copy of a book that I meant to order for my Kindle, instead of dealing with return hassles I sent the hard copy to ArchrWndrMcRbrt because he reads the same book series
[04:08:22] <Hrafnbjorn> I should read some fiction soon... right now I am reading a book about Kensington Rune Stone
[04:09:12] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The first one she ran across at a bookstore was Iron Kissed, and I asked if she'd started it yet. When she said, "No", I suggested she get Moon Called and Blood Bound from the Library, to keep everything in perspective.
[04:09:35] <North> Hraf, have you read 'Valis', by Philip K. Dick?
[04:09:40] <Hrafnbjorn> what is the story line behind them?
[04:09:48] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Reads AND loves, DarkWitchl.  :)
[04:09:52] <Hrafnbjorn> no I havent, North... is it good?

[04:10:47] <Hrafnbjorn> I used to really like Anne Rice, but her books start getting repetative after a while
[04:10:51] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa analagom!
[04:10:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The main character is a half Anglo, half Blackfooy  coyote shapeshifter who is associated with a werewolf pack, and in a later book becomes mated to the Alpha.
[04:11:08] <analagom> Hello
[04:11:12] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Blackfoot
[04:11:39] <Hrafnbjorn> that almost sounds like a True Blood type story

[04:12:02] <Abraxas> nothing nothing
[04:12:09] <DarkWitch> these books are actually written for adults and not for tweens Hrafnbjorn
[04:12:17] <Hrafnbjorn> ah, ok
[04:12:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> She is also a VW mechanic who owns her own garage, which she bought from the previous owner, a Fae who had to reveal himself to the public at the orders of the rulers of the fae
[04:12:32] <Hrafnbjorn> which one is best to start on?
[04:12:45] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Moon Called, Hrafnbjorn
[04:12:50] <Hrafnbjorn> ok, thanks
[04:13:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> They are sequential, and make references to previous ones, so it's best to go in order

[04:14:04] <DarkWitch> yeah, story makes more sense if you read the books in order
[04:14:17] <Hrafnbjorn> ugh, I dunno if I wanna spend $8 on a kindle book
[04:14:21] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And, as DarkWitch says, they are written for Grown Adults.
[04:14:27] <Hrafnbjorn> I will have to check the used book store

[04:15:33] <Hrafnbjorn> I kinda prefer kindle for fiction, but paper for non-fictiion, cause its harder to reference back on kindle
[04:16:22] <North> great space-saver as well, I suppose
[04:16:37] <DarkWitch> I wonder if you could "borrow" the book from me on Kindle, through the Amazon Prime thing?

[04:40:07] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> O(ne of my favorite FB memes: "Dear Autocorrect. My occasional cuss words are necessary to properly emphasize my point. So stop editing me, motor forker!"

[04:41:01] <BansheeTears> Sometimes there's nothing like a well placed cuss word
[04:41:15] <BansheeTears> Albeit sparing
[04:41:25] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> "Power words" one source calls them.
[04:41:51] <Hrafnbjorn> "ass" is a true power word
[04:42:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Indeed
[04:42:18] <Hrafnbjorn> tis English for deity, also it is one of the younger row runes :)
[04:42:31] <Hrafnbjorn> actualy English version is Oss though
[04:43:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Or, "arse"?
[04:43:19] <BansheeTears> Arse to?
[04:43:26] <SpiritSong> lol
[04:43:41] <SpiritSong> focle is irish for word

[04:43:46] <SpiritSong> hehe
[04:43:53] <BansheeTears> Lol!!
[04:44:01] <Hrafnbjorn> Arse isnt related to the rune as far as I know
[04:44:14] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> but, it IS British
[04:44:21] <BansheeTears> Ahhh
[04:44:22] <SpiritSong> so we looooved saying it in school... oh but miss oconner we were only practicing the irish for word
[04:44:29] <Hrafnbjorn> I think its more of a spelling for how oss is pronounced in Northumbria
[04:44:32] <SpiritSong> 7 year olds....
[04:44:56] <North> rascally Birdy
[04:45:05] <SpiritSong> is oss said like awwss or ass

[05:11:41] <BansheeTears> Yup and it's like a woman's confidential group
[05:12:07] <BansheeTears> Very interesting
[05:12:26] <SpiritSong> there is a womans group in elements too i think
[05:12:30] <BansheeTears> Dunno where it will lead but it's just adding good stuff and more resources
[05:12:40] <SpiritSong> exactly
[05:12:49] <BansheeTears> Worth looking into
[05:12:52] <SpiritSong> you can never try too many things
[05:13:05] <SpiritSong> i might do...but i tend to prefer mixed gender groups
[05:13:28] <SpiritSong> i wouldnt write it off right away though
[05:13:33] <BansheeTears> Unless you trying them half assed because your trying to do too much
[05:13:45] <SpiritSong> yeah well there is that too
[05:13:54] <BansheeTears> I usually do too.. But this was enjoyable
[05:13:58] <SpiritSong> maybe one or two things focus on a month
[05:14:23] <SpiritSong> what else did ye talk of
[05:14:30] <SpiritSong> i mean that you can say here
[05:14:33] <BansheeTears> Whatever you do - take your time and enjoy the view
[05:14:41] <SpiritSong> yup:)
[05:14:53] <BansheeTears> :)
[05:15:52] <BansheeTears> Watching sleepy hollow with hubby
[05:15:54] <SpiritSong> i wish i didnt lkive so far away from the city. its an hours ddrive if i so much as want to just see someone
[05:15:59] <BansheeTears> Stupid show
[05:16:08] <SpiritSong> id go to so much more if i was nearer

[05:16:27] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Galway is THAT small a town, lass?
[05:16:56] <BansheeTears> Isn't it like third to Dublin and Belfast?
[05:17:20] *** Quits: Edward (Edward@my.vhost) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:17:20] <BansheeTears> Always pictured more people
[05:17:21] <SpiritSong> its small by city standards but galway is the second biggeest county and the second least populated....lol
[05:17:32] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ah
[05:17:38] <SpiritSong> so seeing friends often involved an hour drive thgrough the countryside
[05:17:47] <BansheeTears> Ahh
[05:17:53] <BansheeTears> Sounds lovely tho
[05:17:59] <SpiritSong> meh....
[05:18:02] <SpiritSong> its lonely
[05:18:13] <SpiritSong> i would rather be near my friends
[05:18:19] <BansheeTears> Out here we crave solitude
[05:18:37] <BansheeTears> Funny how it works
[05:18:42] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Kind of like South Dakota, here. Huge state, land area wise, but the total poplation is about the same as the county I live in.
[05:18:45] <SpiritSong> its not so nice when you cant see people when you want though :P
[05:18:51] <SpiritSong> then its isolation
[05:19:04] <BansheeTears> Yea I hear that
[05:19:34] <BansheeTears> Jacumba only had 300  and the terrain was hell
[05:19:45] <SpiritSong> 300 people?
[05:19:46] <SpiritSong> wow
[05:19:49] <BansheeTears> Gets Los seeing the same faces
[05:19:58] <BansheeTears> Old*
[05:20:13] <SpiritSong> my high school in the countryside had more peeps than that lmao
[05:20:25] <BansheeTears> We didn't have a school
[05:20:41] <SpiritSong> wow where did the kids go to learn/be brainwashed
[05:20:56] <BansheeTears> Only a library post office and a small market
[05:21:05] <BansheeTears> Next town over
[05:21:10] <SpiritSong> ahhhh
[05:21:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ah
[05:21:17] <BansheeTears> Small school 25 min drive tho
[05:21:53] <BansheeTears> There was only a handful of kids, no hospital either
[05:21:58] <SpiritSong> our school was in a small town/village, and there was other towns and villages around....so the schools would be rivals.....country schools..lordy
[05:22:09] <BansheeTears> Had to get air lifted in a emergency
[05:22:17] <SpiritSong> oh damn
[05:22:48] <BansheeTears> There was prolly ten kids school age
[05:22:55] <BansheeTears> Rest were older folks
[05:23:07] <SpiritSong> dang
[05:23:18] <SpiritSong> not many kiddos then
[05:23:18] <BansheeTears> I'll bet football was a real nuthouse
[05:23:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> So, if you were going to play football between your school and another, SpiritSong, pretty much the whole tudent body was on the side?
[05:23:31] <BansheeTears> All the teams getting rowdy

An intoxicated fellow got on, and he sniffed the air. She said, "You like that, huh? What's it smell like?' He said, "Smells like someone shat a Christmas tree."
[05:31:56] <MissSugar> LOL

[05:45:12] <SpiritSong> hows you
[05:45:16] <Pores> I'm confused atm
[05:45:23] <Pores> There's a bit of complexity in the air
[05:45:40] *** Quits: BansheeTears (balefire@sorcery-qee61f.phnx.qwest.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[05:45:40] <Pores> It has to do with motive and fear
[05:45:49] <SpiritSong> personal to you?
[05:46:04] <Pores> I sense no, but something is trying to make it so something bad doesn't happen to me
[05:46:21] <Pores> A very powerful observer
[05:46:38] <Pores> I suppose they just didn't get the motive about emotions, and flow pristinity
[05:46:47] <SpiritSong> oohh well thats positive right? you're protected
[05:46:49] <Pores> memo* not motive
[05:46:54] <Pores> No necessarily
[05:46:59] <Pores> It's more of smother than a protection
[05:47:07] *** Joins: AntleredGirl (Mibbit@sorcery-35s5fq.res.rr.com)
[05:47:08] <SpiritSong> ahhh
[05:47:09] <Abraxas> Welcome, AntleredGirl. As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of being.
[05:47:12] <SpiritSong> control?
[05:47:13] <Pores> They fear ghosts
[05:47:17] <Pores> I don't :P
[05:47:26] <Pores> That seems to be the heart of the situation
[05:47:43] <Pores> I had free-thought thinking today, and gained insight on ghosts and psychology
[05:48:01] <Pores> Control to try to make something bad not happen
[05:48:06] <Pores> It's good intentioned (?)
[05:48:30] <SpiritSong> so somoene casts protection over you?
[05:48:34] <Pores> People fear ghosts because they emit bad energy. But if you understood them, you'd be able to enhance the energy flow of your surroundings, and allow them to pass through
[05:48:41] <North> good greetings, Mozely
[05:48:45] <Pores> No, it's a non-physical being
[05:48:47] <Pores> I'm not a newbie lol
[05:49:03] <AntleredGirl> Hi there, North, SpiritSong, Pores, anyone else I missed.
[05:49:09] <SpiritSong> heys Aedylthryd
[05:49:12] <SpiritSong> i mean AntleredGirl
[05:49:18] <AntleredGirl> :D
[05:49:34] <Pores> This super observer is trying to make it so the ghosts do not cause me to be in a bad situation. Instead, they should stop trying to control the ghosts, and instead, allow them to be free, as to offer pristine flow
[05:49:45] <North> how's the night in Molly Town?
[05:49:49] <Pores> This will increase the potential of passing over
[05:50:05] <Pores> There are far too many ghosts backed up on this planet to worry about their actions
[05:50:18] <Pores> We need to get them to pass ASAP
[05:50:44] <Pores> hi AntleredGirl
[05:50:51] <Aedylthryd> Hello, anyway, SpiritSong
[05:51:05] <MissSugar> hey AntleredGirl 
[05:51:54] <Pores> A lot of people try to control negative energy sources, but it's a mistake. You lose the power of sincerity when you do this. People do not say hi when they want to, people don't voice themselves, and actions become stopped and voices become silenced
[05:52:13] <SpiritSong> who is controlling it
[05:52:26] <Pores> It's something people try to do when they do not learn about unity of consciousness lol
[05:52:38] <Pores> So generally everyone does it at one point
[05:54:03] <AntleredGirl> Night's somber, North.
[05:54:05] <SpiritSong> nods
[05:54:21] * North also nods
[05:54:33] <SpiritSong> controlling is pretty much a good way of pissing entities off :P
[05:54:52] <Pores> Or stopping growth
[05:54:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Indeed, SpiritSong
[05:55:08] <North> somber nights happen
[05:55:22] <Pores> Limiting the power of art, decreasing the spirit of warriors, etc
[05:55:22] <MissSugar> they do
[05:55:31] <AntleredGirl> My roommate's shift leader had something horrible happen to him.
[05:55:39] <AntleredGirl> Roommate's very upset. 
[05:55:44] <SpiritSong> what happpned AntleredGirl
[05:55:47] <North> :/
[05:55:59] <AntleredGirl> Break-in, rape, and murder.
[05:56:14] <North> !
[05:56:17] <SpiritSong> damn,,,thats effen awful
[05:56:17] <MissSugar> oh dear lord
[05:56:17] <Pores> o.o
[05:56:28] <AntleredGirl> Yes. You can imagine how upset we ALL are. 
[05:56:47] <SpiritSong> of course  :(
[05:57:11] <AntleredGirl> I'm sorry, perhaps I should have warned everyone how bad it was. 
[05:57:18] <MissSugar> no its alright
[05:57:20] <SpiritSong> it's ok sweety
[05:57:53] <North> helluva thing
[05:58:28] <SpiritSong> yeah :(
[05:58:59] <AntleredGirl> I said prayers and lit a flame and incense and...man...
[05:59:32] <AntleredGirl> I really can only think of what that kind of violence creates in energy.
[05:59:43] <Pores> You don't want to know
[05:59:48] <SpiritSong> no doubt :/
[06:00:10] <CSD> snowflake obsidian ball in the residence yesterday
[06:00:31] <CSD> day before
[06:00:34] <Iona> AntleredGirl: are you okay?
[06:00:42] <AntleredGirl> No, I'm saying, I've been wondering very far down the road this thought goes; the ripple effect, the countless connections and causes and effects
[06:01:12] <Iona> Many...
[06:01:13] <CSD> ya, the karma reaches further than one would immagine
[06:01:14] <AntleredGirl> Not just the spot of violence, not just the lingering horror, but the future of it.
[06:01:47] <SpiritSong> those things do stick arounds :(
[06:02:07] <Iona> The means to break that cycle...
[06:02:18] <Iona> Is a pursuit of many lifetimes
[06:03:10] <Iona> Be good to yourself and others... Evil exists, its true... Don't turn from it, but endure it...
[06:03:42] <AntleredGirl> In the meantime, I'm wondering which tea to brew for my roommate.
[06:03:51] <AntleredGirl> (ha)
[06:03:55] <North> chamomile might be good
[06:04:00] <SpiritSong> ^ 
[06:04:10] <Iona> According to which cultures? (Tea)
[06:04:13] <SpiritSong> chamomile is a nice calming blend
[06:04:20] * North nods
[06:04:29] <AntleredGirl> Very much so. 
[06:04:37] <AntleredGirl> And something I have.
[06:04:43] <AntleredGirl> I was considering ginger, though.
[06:04:45] <AntleredGirl> Honey ginger.
[06:04:52] <AntleredGirl> Upset stomach.
[06:04:58] <North> perfect
[06:04:59] <CSD> gingers steal souls, js
[06:05:01] <Iona> Chamomile is good, I would do an oolong tea ritual myself..
[06:05:20] <Pores> I don't know if this is good advice, or should be taken as advice or consolation, but I've seen that even the greatest of evil has a source of good
[06:05:33] <Iona> CSD: truth. Now I'm not strawberry blonde...
[06:05:50] <Pores> I think you can banish evil energy with the knowledge of its source
[06:06:00] <Iona> Agreed Pores.
[06:07:22] <CSD> would be recurrant from the not source person in this case
[06:07:45] <Iona> That being said... Its not something I can speak with authority on...
[06:09:54] * SpiritSong hugs AntleredGirl
[06:09:55] <Iona> AntleredGirl: I hope everything finds a sense of kindness and compassion soon...
[06:10:23] <AntleredGirl> I'm hoping so, as well. Thank you.

[06:16:30] <MissSugar> you could also make a wash for your house with some dawn soap and herbs, to really spiritually clean your home

[07:04:23] <jenna96> so whats up?
[07:05:33] <MissSugar> not a whole heck of a lot right now
[07:05:57] <jenna96> same
[07:11:29] <jenna96> I'm still learning things here and am bad at constantly getting on. 
[07:11:55] <MissSugar> take your time
[07:12:20] <jenna96> just not sure what to do
[07:13:13] <MissSugar> with what?
[07:13:51] <jenna96> well anything witchcraft. I'm still new. i got sites to look at but I'm at a stand still
[07:13:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> We all felt that way at the beginning, we all learn at our own pace.
[07:14:53] <jenna96> i don't want to rush things but i just don't know what to do.

[07:20:02] <jenna96> so i guess I'm wondering if I can get some help. i don't want to be a bother though
[07:21:12] <MissSugar> well what are you interested in specifically
[07:22:27] <jenna96> working with energies and spells. the closest thing I have done is something with chakra
[07:23:21] <MissSugar> ok well you could look into raw magick which is the putting together of spells through various items
[07:23:43] <MissSugar> you could look also into energy work such as meditation, trance, grounding, astral projection etc.
[07:24:03] <jenna96> I heard of grounding and meditation. 
[07:24:38] <jenna96> something id be interested in but I have a hard time calming my mind
[07:25:16] <MissSugar> it takes practice, some say to let the thoughts come but see them as soap bubbles capturing the thoughts and drifting away
[07:26:28] <jenna96> ok
[07:27:48] <jenna96> I guess another thing to is finding friends to keep me motivated. I've tried many places but i have a hard time getting in or breaking the ice and staying with it. 
[07:28:20] <MissSugar> well i hope that you get more comfortable here, we have quite a few people with different paths that can give you different points of view
[07:29:11] <jenna96> I'm trying. just hard for me. 
[07:29:22] <MissSugar> i can understand that
[07:31:08] <jenna96> I've been coming here for a bit. just kinda trying and one said they would work with me but i lost contact and never saved the pm. so i guess i just need to keep asking and trying. sorry if this is kinda a bother
[07:32:07] <MissSugar> no bother
[07:32:21] <MissSugar> just keep asking questions, practicing, and reading
[07:32:25] <MissSugar> thats all you can really do

[08:14:34] <DawnBatGuano> I'm aware actually.
[08:14:40] <DawnBatGuano> And there seems to be no fix :/
[08:14:51] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That it can. I worked with a guy who had that. He'd go through a big bottle of Maalox every week

[08:27:06] <MissSugar> oh man that would be awesome
[08:27:11] <Keith> i have just never had luck with meditation
[08:27:45] <DawnBatGuano> Mummies, Wraiths, Draugr or Zombies?
[08:27:48] <MissSugar> oh well i add binural beats to mine so that it induces the waves in your brain that bring you down into a theta state
[08:28:01] <MissSugar> zombies of course
[08:28:03] <DawnBatGuano> binural beats give me a headache
[08:28:21] <DawnBatGuano> wouldn't a mummy be stronger? That's a legit question actually xD
[08:28:21] <Keith> i have no idea what any of that means MissSugar lol
[08:28:44] <Keith> DawnBatGuano, the mummy would only be as strong as the person putting into it
[08:28:52] <DawnBatGuano> true
[08:28:55] <DawnBatGuano> Now Draugr
[08:28:55] <Keith> just like in creating a spell
[08:28:57] <DawnBatGuano> yikes
[08:29:14] <Keith> what are draugr?
[08:29:28] <MissSugar> oh your brain has different waves in each state of consciousness, so right now you are in an Alpha state your brain waves are alert
[08:29:36] <Keith> k
[08:29:43] <MissSugar> in a Theta state you are in a trance like state
[08:30:06] <MissSugar> that is the state you can astral travel, go into deep meditation, etc
[08:30:21] <Keith> that is odd.
[08:30:29] <MissSugar> it is
[08:30:36] <DawnBatGuano> Draugr are like
[08:30:40] <Keith> if you need that state of mind of theta, how come i can do it in alpha?
[08:30:41] <DawnBatGuano> zombies on steroids
[08:30:44] <MissSugar> there is also a company that specifically does theta wave meditation
[08:30:48] <DawnBatGuano> they're Scandinavian
[08:30:55] <Keith> ahh
[08:31:47] <DawnBatGuano> the language in The Mummy is similar to Middle Egyptian but I don't think it is
[08:31:57] <MissSugar> there are also different waves that can induce different states of being, like being drunk or being on a hallucinogen 
[08:32:05] <Keith> MissSugar perhaps if you can find one of these theta meditation sound bytes, i will give it a shot
[08:32:18] <Keith> i have heard of that
[08:32:56] <DawnBatGuano> you know what's odd? Tibetan Singing Bowls give me a headache
[08:33:03] <MissSugar> https://soundcloud.com/danielle-andrewson/astral-travel
[08:33:33] <Keith> is that your voice at the beginning?
[08:33:40] <MissSugar> nope
[08:33:46] <Keith> didn't think so
[08:33:47] <MissSugar> this is a professional company 
[08:33:58] <MissSugar> my voice is way less smooth
[08:34:09] <DawnBatGuano> it's obvious MissSugar sounds like a purring kitten :)
[08:34:24] <MissSugar> LOL or a shell beach learned to talk
[08:34:27] <Keith> i honestly don't think you voice is that bad
[08:35:24] <DawnBatGuano> oooh
[08:35:31] <DawnBatGuano> I think I have seen the veve before
[08:36:07] <MissSugar> which one?
[08:36:09] <DawnBatGuano> MissSugar: your voice is....it's hard to explain
[08:36:14] <MissSugar> LOL
[08:36:15] <DawnBatGuano> The symbol in genera
[08:36:19] <DawnBatGuano> I'm serious
[08:36:24] <DawnBatGuano> it sound rather matronly
[08:36:43] <MissSugar> there are tons of veves
[08:36:51] <MissSugar> what does it look like
[08:37:03] <DawnBatGuano> the heart
[08:37:15] <MissSugar> just a heart or does it have a sword through it
[08:37:19] <DawnBatGuano> sword through it
[08:37:38] <MissSugar> that is Erzulie Danto
[08:37:48] <DawnBatGuano> I saw that one (well similar) on American Horror Story : Coven
[08:38:23] <MissSugar> Erzulie Danto is a Petro spirit, during the haitian revolution they cut out her tongue so she couldnt leak information to the enemy 
[08:39:25] <DawnBatGuano> oh fun
[08:39:45] <MissSugar> yup
[08:40:25] <DawnBatGuano> Wait, what are they used for?
[08:41:05] * Keith grumbles and hates being impatient
[08:41:11] <MissSugar> she is often portrayed as saint Czstochowa
[08:41:20] <DawnBatGuano> The only known Loa who appears in Coven is Papa Legba, the Voodoo Loa of time, travel and the underworld.
[08:41:32] <MissSugar> no he totally isnt
[08:41:36] <MissSugar> but hey
[08:42:10] <MissSugar> the Veve is to directly communicate with the Lwa and to bring them down to the place of worship
[08:42:16] <DawnBatGuano> ahhhh
[08:42:26] <DawnBatGuano> so Papa Legba is an actual lwa?
[08:42:42] <MissSugar> Papa Legba is the gate keeper of the spirit world, he is some what of a trickster, he is a teacher, a teller of stories, the crossroads
[08:43:16] <DawnBatGuano> Is there any clear description of the spirit world orrr? (and does it have a name)
[08:43:17] <MissSugar> while Danto is the patron of abused women, working women, mothers
[08:44:13] <DawnBatGuano> Oh

[08:45:16] <MissSugar> Guinen is the name of the afterlife, it is considered to be under the water
[08:45:23] <Keith> the womans voice is too loud
[08:45:36] <DawnBatGuano> MissSugar: That's all we know?
[08:45:40] <Keith> sweet i love swimming
[08:46:00] <MissSugar> http://www.spellmaker.com/images/alegba3.jpg
[08:46:12] <MissSugar> this is legba he is an old man
[08:46:21] <DawnBatGuano> Seems trustworthy actually
[08:46:34] <DawnBatGuano> Then againnnnnnn
[08:46:35] <MissSugar> he is a peaceful spirit for the most part
[08:46:41] <DawnBatGuano> Oh alright
[08:47:49] <DawnBatGuano> I have a kind of strange question, is there any specific views on LGBT in Voodoo?
[08:48:11] <MissSugar> yup you are cool to love who you want
[08:48:14] <DawnBatGuano> oh wow
[08:48:19] <MissSugar> there are even lgbt spirits
[08:48:25] <DawnBatGuano> ohhhh woowwwww
[08:48:28] <DawnBatGuano> That's a new one for me
[08:48:57] <MissSugar> Baron Limba and Baron Lundy
[08:49:00] <DawnBatGuano> Pretty much any faith I know be it Abrahamic , Eastern or what it's usually unheard of
[08:49:11] <MissSugar> there is even Gede Nibo who is a cross dresser
[08:49:35] <Keith> sorry all I am getting tired..... I am off to bed :) have agreat night :D
[08:49:36] <DawnBatGuano> this is actually real amazing and suprising for me, considering the African and Christian origins ya know.
[08:49:39] <DawnBatGuano> night Keith
[08:49:51] <Keith> nite DBG
[08:49:51] <MissSugar> have a good sleep Keith
[08:49:59] <Keith> thanks MissSugar :D
[08:50:05] *** Quits: Keith (Keithh@sorcery-tcaa47.abhsia.telus.net) (Quit: )
[08:50:40] <DawnBatGuano> lgbt in Kemet is a bit obscure actually. Almost nothing is known about it. All I know is that it's a no no somewhat in The Book of The Dead.
[08:50:43] <MissSugar> the Gedes are outrageous anyway
[08:51:14] <MissSugar> they make fun of our puritan beliefs of sex and death, often over sexualizing everything as satire of the fleeting nature of life
[08:51:25] <DawnBatGuano> ohhhh
[08:51:31] <DawnBatGuano> what do the prefixes mean btw?
[08:51:51] <MissSugar> Gede is a family of spirits of death
[08:52:14] *** Quits: s4ge (m0rik@sorcery-jpfi4j.nsvltn.sbcglobal.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[08:52:14] <MissSugar> even an aunt or mother or father or brother can be a Ghede
[08:52:18] <DawnBatGuano> oh alright
[08:52:32] <MissSugar> they are the dead
[08:53:05] <MissSugar> Like Mother Danto some of the Lwa were once real people who were elevated to the rank of Lwa
[08:53:29] <DawnBatGuano> reminds me a bit of Shintoism I think it is
[08:53:40] <MissSugar> when you die and go to the water under the world sometimes you come back, sometimes you elevate to honored ancestor and sometimes you go to Lwa
[08:53:56] <MissSugar> sometimes you stay there in peace until you make up your mind 
[08:54:02] <DawnBatGuano> so Voodoo has a form of resurrection?
[08:54:07] <MissSugar> yup
[08:54:30] <DawnBatGuano> and raising the dead. Is that a thing or?
[08:54:34] <DawnBatGuano> (stupid question imo xD)
[08:54:36] <MissSugar> when i wrote that book on the afterlife water was a main theme, it represents rebirth, life as well as the peace of death
[08:54:42] <MissSugar> no that is a thing
[08:54:52] <DawnBatGuano> spooky
[08:55:03] <MissSugar> what will happen is a person who is able to give good advice is dug up and their skull is placed on an altar 
[08:55:24] <MissSugar> then the spirit of that person is forced to come back and answer questions that are put to it
[08:55:40] <DawnBatGuano> There seems to be a lot of death in Voodoo
[08:55:55] *** Aria|away is now known as Aria
[08:56:18] <MissSugar> death is a part of life
[08:56:36] <MissSugar> it effects us all, and it is an honor to be remembered 
[08:56:37] <DawnBatGuano> that's true
[08:57:21] <DawnBatGuano> I had an Aunt ( i rarely talk about this really. ) and I feel as if somehow she's kinda "latched" onto me spiritually.
[08:57:40] <MissSugar> there are many other Lwa that reside over other things, Ogun works with industry and metals, Simbi works with technology and sorcery, Ogun La Flambeau has his hand in war 
[08:58:15] <MissSugar> there are thousands of Lwa, but the ones that people see the most are the Barons or the Ghedes because they are the most outrageous of the bunch
[08:58:30] <DawnBatGuano> ahhhh
[08:59:20] <DawnBatGuano> blechhhh, I feel real emotional ><
[08:59:55] <MissSugar> and each person has a Met tet a Lwa that works specifically with you, they are your guardian spirit, they reside in your head and guide you through Voodoo

[08:59:57] <Abraxas> Welcome, analagom. Ultimately though it is up to each individual to decide how they wish to perceive reality.  Which is how it should be.
[09:01:45] <Aria> Hi everyone ^^
[09:01:51] <MissSugar> hey Aria
[09:01:54] <MissSugar> hey analagom 
[09:02:01] <Aria> um, so
[09:02:08] <Aria> I must admit I haven't exactly been present hee
[09:02:09] <Aria> here*
[09:02:14] <Aria> Nor did I get to know many of you that well :o
[09:02:16] <analagom> Hey MissSugar 
[09:02:16] <DawnBatGuano> I think discussing spiritual stuff opens like.....a floodgate ro something.
[09:02:22] <Aria> So, um, hi! I'm Aria.. 
[09:02:32] <MissSugar> Hi Aria nice to meet you
[09:02:41] <Aria> Nice to meet you too ^.^
[09:03:57] * DawnBatGuano returns to lurking
[09:04:18] <analagom> Yes it does
[09:05:09] <analagom> I occasionally have spiritual discussions that tend to make people think I'm crazy
[09:05:27] <analagom> And I met a few psychopaths in the process
[09:06:00] <analagom> But a few saints too
[09:06:02] <DawnBatGuano> who wants relationship advice from Overly Attached Girlfriend?
[09:06:34] <analagom> Um, how does one become more affectionate
[09:06:43] <DawnBatGuano> It's a video xD
[09:07:01] <analagom> Oh
[09:07:07] <analagom> But srsly
[09:07:26] <DawnBatGuano> omfg
[09:07:27] <DawnBatGuano> After taking your relationship advice and following it to a T, my future girlfriend was so impressed by my determination that she mentioned me to various friends of hers, with odd names like "My Attorney," "Your Court Appointed Attorney," "County Clerk,"
[09:07:44] <analagom> Jesus
[09:08:23] <DawnBatGuano> xD
[09:08:34] <MissSugar> LOL
[09:08:39] <DawnBatGuano> MissSugar: Do you have a man perhaps? :p
[09:08:51] <MissSugar> i do
[09:08:54] <MissSugar> his name is Cotton
[09:09:06] <DawnBatGuano> :D
[09:09:11] <DawnBatGuano> lemme guesss
[09:09:13] <DawnBatGuano> hmmm
[09:09:19] <DawnBatGuano> I am sensing "Tall, Dark and Handsome"
[09:09:46] <MissSugar> LOL
[09:09:49] <MissSugar> he is
[09:10:17] <Aria> Ooh I like Overly Attached Girlfriend's (Laina's) video's :D She gives *very* good relationship advice xD forwhenyouwanttobeastalker..psshdonttellanyone
[09:10:21] <DawnBatGuano> ^
[09:10:38] <Aria> I like the one about making a sandwich for your man >:3
[09:10:49] <DawnBatGuano> I'd read more MissSugar but it'd be r00D
[09:11:22] <Aria> Anyway, analagom, yeah, if you hold spiritual discussions, it's best to do it with the people who are open to it... otherwise you're opening yourself open to bad stuff, I have found >.<
[09:11:37] <DawnBatGuano> found this in a facebook post " Can you be redeemed? Only if you give your heart to Jesus.
[09:11:44] <Aria> Ugh
[09:12:08] <DawnBatGuano> it's frommmmmm a page called " Satan Exposed In Popular Culture "
[09:12:19] <Aria> ....
[09:12:22] <Aria> double ugh
[09:12:46] <DawnBatGuano> :p
[09:12:54] <DawnBatGuano> I had a thought.
[09:13:04] <DawnBatGuano> Relationships are A) Crappy and B) The work of evil.
[09:13:19] <Aria> Satan Exposed As A Butchering Of The Old Pagan God Cernunnos*
[09:13:23] <Aria> would be a better title :D
[09:14:10] <analagom> Aria, I am unaffectionate except to matters of spirituality
[09:14:39] * Aria nods
[09:15:24] <analagom> I suppose that is my curse when I entered this world
[09:16:15] <DawnBatGuano> I'm trying to distract myself from this tumultuous existential void of anguish we call "life"
[09:16:36] <Aria> Well, analagom.. if I understand the meaning of what you're saying correctly...
[09:17:00] <Aria> I have somewhat of the same... Spirituality/magick is my #1 thing, my #1 interest, and all other things are less interesting to me
[09:17:23] <analagom> Yea
[09:17:39] <Aria> I don't see it as a curse, however
[09:17:45] <Aria> I see it as a guiding light ^.^
[09:19:12] <analagom> Yea, at times challenging in the separation and loneliness for intimacy
[09:19:18] * Aria nods...
[09:19:30] <DawnBatGuano> Fifty Shades of Grey Trailer parodies are funny
[09:19:41] <Aria> Usually when I look for a relationship... if they're not accepting of my practice and love of magick, i'm out...
[09:19:44] <analagom> Haha, I have to see them
[09:20:06] <Aria> Which is unhandy because not many people are into magick
[09:20:24] <DawnBatGuano> cause most people dont see that it's EVERYWHERE
[09:20:30] <Aria> Well, compared to the amount of guys that are available for dating...
[09:20:36] <Aria> mmhm DawnBatGuano... they don't...
[09:21:07] <DawnBatGuano> heck
[09:21:11] <DawnBatGuano> its even in other faiths
[09:21:55] <Aria> As far as I understand it, Christianity forbids their followers from pursuing magick
[09:22:02] <Aria> because it's "meant only for the lord" ._.
[09:22:04] <Aria> blegh
[09:22:39] <DawnBatGuano> It's present in their ceremonies in a sense
[09:24:40] <DawnBatGuano> you know what'd be nice
[09:26:33] <MissSugar> what?
[09:26:44] <DawnBatGuano> being an Angel of Death
[09:27:03] <MissSugar> there are many psychopomps
[09:27:30] <DawnBatGuano> what?
[09:28:21] <MissSugar> its quite fascinating, Beelzubub for example was a psychopomp before he was a demon, it was believed that when you died you became an insect and that Beelzubub shepherded you to the afterlife, hence the "lord of the flies" title
[09:28:39] <MissSugar> psychopomps are spirits that assist in the shepherding of spirits to the afterlife
[09:28:51] <DawnBatGuano> ohhhhh
[09:28:56] <DawnBatGuano> I just think it'd be kinda
[09:28:58] <DawnBatGuano> comforting
[09:29:39] <MissSugar> be a lot of responsibility as well

[13:00:54] <North> greetings, Centauri 
[13:01:01] <North> how's the day?
[13:01:23] <Centauri> Not bad, been up all night as I work 3:30PM to 3:30am, but not bad
[13:01:47] <North> long shift
[13:02:02] <Centauri> indeed it is, I am beat to death by friday
[13:02:33] <North> understandably
[13:02:48] <Centauri> <too old fer this shit lol
[13:02:55] <North> work can suck the life out of a person
[13:03:17] <Centauri> it can, and i have always tried to find a work like balance, sometimes taking years off
[13:03:34] <Centauri> but then the creditors come and want their cut
[13:04:02] <Centauri> whatever happend to staking a claim in the forest, and living off the land and oweing no one anything
[13:04:56] <Centauri> gotta move to another planet now, to make new claims that no one owns
[13:04:57] <North> gone with the wind
[13:05:12] <North> Europa may be your best prospect
[13:05:26] <Centauri> Heh, yes, thats one
[13:05:40] <North> providing that you're a fan of lower light levels    ;)
[13:05:59] <Centauri> I say we can make real estate in near space, dont need a whole planet, actually
[13:06:28] <Centauri> I have a few designs for grand space stations, with full gravity and some big enough to have weather inside
[13:06:47] <North> a thing of wonder
[13:07:15] <Centauri> 15 x 40 km in size, atmo as high as 30,000 feet to the center
[13:07:54] <North> lots of leg room
[13:08:13] <Centauri> INdeed, the surface area inside would be some 1200 sq km
[13:08:57] <North> Luxembourg in Space
[13:09:10] <Centauri> LOL, perhaps, but warmer
[13:09:36] <North> nice
[13:10:26] <Centauri> I figure only 0.47 RPM is all thats needed for 1 G
[13:10:35] <Centauri> for something that size
[13:11:04] <North> gotta keep the bone density intact
[13:11:10] * North wanders off to make coffee
[13:12:45] <Centauri> Far more than that, as we are creatures of 1G, digestion, waste elimination, many things in the body rely on us being upright in a G force

[13:17:30] <North> yepper
[13:17:53] <Centauri> I still test many such things on my sim
[13:18:20] <North> that space station would be well stocked with coffee, I trust
[13:18:21] <Centauri> food production, recycling of air and waste, etc
[13:18:30] <Centauri> lol of course
[13:18:36] * North salutes with his mug
[13:18:46] <Centauri> <needs caffeine too
[13:18:57] <North> stuff of life
[13:19:09] <Centauri> it is these days
[13:20:15] <North> we do what we must
[13:20:22] <Centauri> I see a timeline where we dont need alarm clocks and can wake and sleep by natural cycles
[13:20:47] <North> much more conducive to good mental health
[13:20:53] <Centauri> Yes
[13:23:05] <Centauri> we suuposedly abolished slavery almost 100 years ago, but because of low wages and high prices for housing and other things, we are mostly slaves to modern society, I rememebr a time when a man could earn enough money in 40 hours a week, that a wife didnt have to work a job, to make it, not so these days
[13:23:58] * North laments
[13:24:03] <Centauri> unless someone has a killer job, its a requirement to have 2 wage earners
[13:24:14] <North> pretty much
[13:24:42] <Centauri> and with that, no better off than those people in the 1950s
[13:25:03] <North> a sad state of affairs
[13:25:08] <Centauri> it is
[13:25:18] <North> alcohol to the rescue
[13:25:27] <Centauri> and ya wonder why I ponder living off world?
[13:25:42] <North> no mystery to me, friend
[13:26:15] <Centauri> hehee
[13:26:56] <North> semi-joking about the booze, btw
[13:27:07] <North> which tends to make things even worse, past a certain point
[13:27:20] <Centauri> I have my 6-pack most night, but keep it to that
[13:27:30] <North> to each their own
[13:27:53] <Centauri> Only cause pot aint legal, and constant drug testing here in the USA
[13:28:23] <North> only a matter of time, perhaps
[13:28:57] <Centauri> Most certainly, the path is following exactly what brought down prohibitio, legalization by states, ahead of the feds
[13:29:36] <Centauri> I read about what happened during prohibition
[13:29:51] <Centauri> and how states started re-legalizing drinking again
[13:30:14] <Centauri> after enough states, the fed repealed prohibition
[13:30:52] * North nods
[13:31:15] <Centauri> and i still live in a backwards state , that has blue laws to this day, silly peeps
[13:32:14] <North> everything passes, for better or worse
[13:33:10] <Centauri> and here I thought there were laws against such things, stating separation of church and state
[13:34:25] <North> cause for wonder
[13:34:31] <Centauri> another reason for a huge plot of land, so I can run nekkie and be driunk iffn I want to, and if no one can see me, it wont bother them
[13:35:29] <North> good to have options
[13:35:37] <Centauri> indeed
[13:35:55] <Centauri> the world is not at all like I knew it was so long ago
[13:36:07] <Centauri> everyone in everyone elses biz
[13:36:08] <North> an R rated version of 'Silent Running'
[13:36:13] <Centauri> "lol
[13:36:14] <North> minus the unfortunate ending
[13:39:10] <Centauri> at least I'll be old and dead, before it gets too screwed up lol

[17:09:24] <SpiritSong> heys Hrafnbjorn!
[17:09:29] <SpiritSong> HOWS YOU
[17:09:31] <SpiritSong> oopes
[17:10:21] <Hrafnbjorn> am well, thanks.  Just got back from taking Sasha for morning walk
[17:10:41] <SpiritSong> where did ye go?
[17:11:10] <Hrafnbjorn> we just walked down the street
[17:11:15] <SpiritSong> nice :)
[17:11:34] <SpiritSong> im making pasta bake
[17:14:52] <Hrafnbjorn> groovy... whomever invented pasta deserves an award
[17:15:49] <SpiritSong> yes they do ^_^
[17:17:52] <SpiritSong> i have tuna, pasta, sweet corn and tomato sauce mixture, topped with chedder cheese
[17:19:50] <Hrafnbjorn> I like to clarify chopped garlic in butter, and mix with cooked pasta.  Its kinda light on the stomach, so good for hot days, and easy to make ;)
[17:20:49] <SpiritSong> omg that sounds so delicious
[17:21:41] <Hrafnbjorn> I just love garlic, so I use it in most things... except stuff supposed to be sweet
[17:25:01] <SpiritSong> lol
[17:25:08] <SpiritSong> chocolate covered garlic
[17:25:11] <SpiritSong> yum!
[17:25:33] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[17:26:04] <SpiritSong> :P
[17:27:03] <SpiritSong> have you been doing more wire wrapping
[17:28:48] <Hrafnbjorn> not lately, no.. I was working on walking stick.... getting the bark off he stick takes a long time with this type wood
[17:29:13] <Hrafnbjorn> would be better if Iused a power tool, but I just use a wood rasp
[17:29:42] <SpiritSong> what is the wood type
[17:29:55] <SpiritSong> i cant wait to see pics ^_^
[17:32:08] <Hrafnbjorn> Im not sure the name of the wood.  Its a popular bush here, but the bark is reall hard when it dries, so you have to either de-bark when its still 'green' wood, in which case you might waste it cause it can start to split, or let it dry to avoid splitting, but then the bark is too hard to use knife.
[17:37:33] <SpiritSong> sorry hraf i was finishing my food lol
[17:38:02] <SpiritSong> you gotta do it in bits at a time then no doubt
