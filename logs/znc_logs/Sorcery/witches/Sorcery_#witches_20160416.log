[01:14:38] <Keith> by chance it was
[01:14:48] <North`> in your neck of the woods?
[01:14:53] <Keith> this to my knowledge is early in the year for my kingdom
[01:15:06] <Keith> kinda.... east of calgary.
[01:15:11] <North`> crazy times
[01:15:13] <Keith> no more than 2 hours away
[01:15:33] <Keith> maybe i will finally be able to geto to see one

[01:20:11] <Keith> yup....she is wise in such matters
[01:20:33] * Keith plays with SpiritSong's yarn
[01:21:00] <SpiritSong> lol
[01:21:56] <Keith> i8 was told that once in a past life i was a magic user that could turn into a kitty of sorts
[01:22:11] <Keith> but i could never find information on him...
[01:22:58] <SpiritSong> if you could turn into a kitty would it make it public knowledge
[01:23:05] <Keith> and you would think there would be something online about him.... but alas.  i find nothing
[01:23:31] <Keith> he was supposed to have been merlins apprentice.
[01:23:48] <SpiritSong> who told you that 
[01:23:50] <Keith> so you would think there would be a story or poem about him somewhere
[01:23:57] <Keith> a sister of sorts
[01:24:24] <Keith> she helped train me in magic back in the day
[01:25:23] <SpiritSong> maybe the shape shifting was on the astral
[01:25:38] <Keith> not to how i understood it, but possibly yes
[01:26:19] <Keith> i was never good at astral travel
[01:27:34] <Keith> she said that, that part of my soul was in someone else
[01:27:43] <Keith> tis confusing to me.
[01:27:55] <Keith> but not very with my outlook on things
[01:27:55] <SpiritSong> google twin flames
[01:27:59] <SpiritSong> she might have meant that
[01:28:24] * Keith looks into it
[01:29:07] <SpiritSong> :)
[01:29:42] <Keith> yes this is possible
[01:29:50] <Keith> thank you kindly SpiritSong
[01:29:51] <SpiritSong> sounds familiar?

[01:30:28] <Keith> it doesnt sound familiar... but it would make sense.
[01:30:37] <Keith> but confuses me more.
[01:30:50] <Keith> cuz she is either marrying, or going to marry my other half...
[01:31:02] <Keith> marrying should be married
[01:31:25] <Keith> do you know much about arthurian lore?
[01:31:29] <SpiritSong> twin flames can be a sisterly/brotherly relationship too
[01:31:37] <SpiritSong> romance cant always happen
[01:31:43] <SpiritSong> so theres that
[01:31:45] <SpiritSong> and i dont
[01:32:02] <Keith> i dont have romantic feelings towards her
[01:32:13] <SpiritSong> nods
[01:32:20] <Keith> and to my knowledge we have had a lot of past lives together
[01:32:45] <SpiritSong> you can inadvertanlty give someone a piece of your soul
[01:32:51] <Keith> i have seen and felt her presence before in past lives
[01:32:59] <SpiritSong> google shamanic soul retrieval and topics around that too
[01:33:00] <SpiritSong> :)
[01:33:11] <SpiritSong> you have a deep connection then

[06:27:06] <CantSirDraggin> most is colorblind
[06:27:22] <Quadpod88> camo breaks up the form
[06:27:35] <CantSirDraggin> less than we believe
[06:27:40] <Quadpod88> why you also add to it
[06:27:45] <CantSirDraggin> more method of concielment
[06:28:11] <Quadpod88> camo stuff is a base, notr to be used alone
[06:28:20] <Centauri> Shapes and colors are one thing, but movement is whats detected the most
[06:28:28] <Quadpod88> yep
[06:28:29] <CantSirDraggin> you sould be all red if your form was a lump, js

[06:59:30] <CantSirDraggin> then it rained
[06:59:33] <BansheeTears> That's nuts
[07:00:01] <CantSirDraggin> took a full two mins of a horn blaring for us to realize that it was her horn shorted by the rain
[07:00:10] <MCMLXV> lol
[07:00:20] <CantSirDraggin> i bled unplugging it
[07:01:03] <CantSirDraggin> good times, lmao

[07:01:53] <MCMLXV> I can laugh.... had my air horn get stuck on my truck one day..... had to stop, shut off the engine and let the air bleed out before I could cut the air line and cap it off with a scew..... sat on the side of the road with my air horn blowing for 5 or 6 minutes
[07:02:07] <CantSirDraggin> lmao!!
[07:02:32] <Keith> lol that would get annoying quick
[07:02:34] <CantSirDraggin> at least you knew who's horn it was

[07:07:07] <Keith> okies dokies :)
[07:07:12] <CantSirDraggin> depends on how big the outlet
[07:07:20] <BansheeTears> I'll forward the old one eventually
[07:07:24] <MCMLXV> I've done 3 test runs with the grove.... screwed up all 3
[07:07:33] <BansheeTears> Till it expires
[07:07:36] <CantSirDraggin> if it's a tire, 35 is a big impact

[07:15:59] <SpiritSong> i lost all my photos of my granparents
[07:16:02] <BansheeTears> No fun
[07:16:04] <SpiritSong> :(
[07:16:20] <BansheeTears> Where would you recommend MCMLXV
[07:16:45] <BansheeTears> Shipping it to hp?
[07:17:12] <BansheeTears> Was thinking about that... But I was scared of it getting damaged
[07:17:23] <SpiritSong> resuce mission to best buy tomorrow? :P
[07:17:25] <MCMLXV> secret shoppers ran a test... the pulled a cable off the hard drive and took it to several shops to be "repaired"..... most of the mom-and-pop shops looked at it, plugged the cord back in, and gave it back.... the few best buy geek squad shops told them they had a virus or the hard drive was bad....... some of the charges were over $100
[07:17:42] <BansheeTears> Shoot
[07:17:48] <SpiritSong> wow
[07:18:00] <MCMLXV> they try to scam you
[07:18:06] <BansheeTears> Hopefully this is. A simple fan replacement
[07:18:17] <BansheeTears> I'll bring my dad
[07:18:28] <MCMLXV> mom and pop shops are the safe route
[07:18:48] <BansheeTears> I'll look for one here
[07:19:07] <BansheeTears> Picking are slim during off season
[07:19:13] <SpiritSong> mom and pop?
[07:19:19] <BansheeTears> Most places are closed down till winter
[07:19:31] <MCMLXV> small shops, owned by individuals
[07:19:43] <BansheeTears> Family style business
[07:19:46] <SpiritSong> lmao i cant help but visualise and elderly couple peering at the laptop together
[07:19:52] <MCMLXV> lol
[07:19:52] <BansheeTears> Lol
[07:20:21] <SpiritSong> pop with a shirt and a smile, mom with a bouncy hairdo and a fond eye
[07:20:28] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> *ahem* Define "elderly", lass.  ;)
[07:20:38] <SpiritSong> and a silly grin about the pulled wire but they are too polite to mock the person
[07:20:38] <BansheeTears> Xp
[07:20:49] <SpiritSong> 80s plus :P
[07:20:52] <SpiritSong> lol
[07:20:59] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ok, then  :)
[07:21:03] <SpiritSong> xD
[07:21:17] <BansheeTears> I picture an old fashion soda fountain shop
[07:21:31] <BansheeTears> Hopefully I get lucky
[07:21:45] <MCMLXV> the guy I go to in aiken is in his 50s-60s...... he knows my face... I'm a repeat customer
[07:22:09] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It's a shame everything closes up just because all the tourists left, BansheeTears. I mean, don't those guys know that locals might have need of them, too?
[07:22:20] <BansheeTears> Now I'm extra happy I backed everything up
[07:22:40] <BansheeTears> Yup..
[07:22:47] <BansheeTears> It's a sore spot here ArchrWndrMcRbrt
[07:22:59] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I can well imagine it is.
[07:23:00] <BansheeTears> The " rounders" get peeved
[07:23:12] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I don't blame them
[07:23:20] * Keith belly flops to his beanbag chair
[07:23:25] <BansheeTears> Only big box and mainstream stores stay open here
[07:23:36] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ah
[07:23:42] <MCMLXV> yellow pages
[07:23:50] <BansheeTears> Almost all of downtown gets shuttered
[07:23:59] <SpiritSong> that sucks :/
[07:23:59] <MCMLXV> look under pc repair...
[07:24:18] <BansheeTears> I did..
[07:24:18] <SpiritSong> can they afford their rent in winter
[07:24:20] <SpiritSong> in summer
[07:24:22] <SpiritSong> i mean
[07:24:44] <MCMLXV> I drive 30 miles to get to the guy I use
[07:24:46] <SpiritSong> we have one shop on the sea front that only opens in summer
[07:24:59] <BansheeTears> Shoulda looked in el control too
[07:25:06] <BansheeTears> El centro
[07:25:23] <BansheeTears> But that's 45 min away
[07:25:34] <SpiritSong> long drive :/
[07:25:40] <BansheeTears> Yea
[07:25:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> At least you don't have to drive all the way to Tucson, BansheeTears
[07:25:49] <BansheeTears> Truth
[07:25:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Or Phoenix
[07:25:59] <BansheeTears> Though that drive is kinda nice
[07:26:02] <SpiritSong> isnt thaqt even further than pheonix
[07:26:06] <MCMLXV> new egg is a good place if you do your own repairs.... and can wait on the parts
[07:26:09] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I have relatives there
[07:26:23] <BansheeTears> We got the parts from newegg

[07:28:54] <Keith> they are alot harder to work on
[07:28:54] <MCMLXV> if you can find the case and a power supply.... most lap tops are propritary tho.... hp laptops require power supplies from hp, and dell requires power supplies from dell
[07:29:06] <BansheeTears> Ahh
[07:29:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> kind of? Doing anything internally is a BIG pain with laptops, BansheeTears.
[07:29:23] <MCMLXV> ^^^
[07:29:26] <BansheeTears> So can't piece meal them so much
[07:29:36] <Keith> and with the money you spend on a laptop you can get a much better desktop

[07:32:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yup, MCMLXV. I've been doing my own repair work on desktops and towers since the old 286 days

[07:33:26] <SpiritSong> hi bonzaibanana
[07:33:33] <BansheeTears> Hi no nzaibanana
[07:33:36] <MCMLXV> right now, there are 3 working pcs in the house... plus brens lap top..... I have 4 cases with parts sitting here too
[07:33:43] <bonzaibanana> hey everybody <('.'<)
[07:33:51] <BansheeTears> Wowzers
[07:33:51] <Keith> oh... on a tangent... does anyone know much about arthurian lore?
[07:33:54] <MCMLXV> hi bonzaibanana
[07:34:02] <BansheeTears> That's a lot of backup
[07:34:07] <MCMLXV> nope, I dont
[07:34:12] <MissSugar> hello bonzaibanana 
[07:34:16] <BansheeTears> Not me
[07:34:38] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> A bit, Keith
[07:34:52] <SpiritSong> it sounds like interesting lore though
[07:35:04] <BansheeTears> Excalibur
[07:35:28] <Keith> ArchrWndrMcRbrt, excellent some is better than none.  do you know if Merlin ever had an apprentice named Melchoir or something similar?
[07:35:31] <BansheeTears> The holy grail, sir Lancelot and the round table stuff?
[07:35:34] <raevynskyyemt> I know some
[07:35:48] <Keith> then this goes to anyone who may know
[07:35:52] <BansheeTears> I don't know
[07:36:07] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Depends on which version you read, Keith. In most, Merlin had NO apprentice.
[07:36:08] <MCMLXV> I thought the Holy Grail was the cup that the Christ drank from at the last supper
[07:36:29] <Keith> so in some he did??
[07:36:33] <raevynskyyemt> I've never read a version with an apprentice 
[07:37:12] <SpiritSong> there's so many cups in  lore that are linked to the holy grail i think. 
[07:37:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> omigosh!!  You're FROM right across the way from the Uk, and you don't know King Arthur, SpiritSong??  I'm astounded!!
[07:37:19] <SpiritSong> some would say its all the same cup
[07:37:24] <MCMLXV> ever see the movie "King Author"?
[07:37:24] <Keith> the apprentice was supposed to be able to change into animals, or just a Cougar... something like that
[07:37:26] <raevynskyyemt> Mcmlxv you're right. Arthur's Knights went on a quest to find it
[07:37:33] <MCMLXV> nods
[07:37:37] <SpiritSong> i know about him, just very little ArchrWndrMcRbrt:P
[07:37:37] <BansheeTears> http://www.kingarthursknights.com/others/merlin.asp
[07:37:42] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ok
[07:37:49] <MCMLXV> so did the Knights Templar
[07:38:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> According to Marion Zimmer Bradley's version, Gwynevere was NOT someone any of us would have liked, and Morgaine is a rather sympathetic figure.
[07:39:58] <BansheeTears> I saw one reference to an apprentice named vivien. On Google
[07:40:09] <BansheeTears> But that's the only ref I found
[07:40:29] <Keith> okies dokies, thanks everyone
[07:40:52] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> No problem, Keith
[07:40:59] <SpiritSong> a female apprentice, cool!
[07:41:20] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I think Vivien was Morgaine's apprentice.
[07:41:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> See if you can find "The Mists Of Avalon", SpiritSong
[07:42:07] <raevynskyyemt> I saw a video about Arthur. They speculated he either lived during or before Roman occupation 
[07:42:30] <SpiritSong> the book?
[07:42:32] <BansheeTears> http://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/i/idylls-of-the-king/summary-and-analysis/merlin-and-vivien
[07:42:38] <Keith> hehe where is hrafnbjorn when there is a topic going?? lol
[07:42:43] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yes, lass. The book.
[07:43:12] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I am mistaken, BansheeTears.
[07:43:37] <BansheeTears> Think she had a wee crush on him
[07:43:47] <MCMLXV> "King Author" is a good movie.... It portays Author as a Roman knight, and merlin and genivere are rebel britons who alli with the romans to fight the invading nords
[07:44:05] <MCMLXV> highly recommended
[07:44:09] <BansheeTears> I watched that one
[07:44:14] <Rajoguna> is that a recent movie?
[07:44:14] <BansheeTears> Loved it
[07:44:16] <MCMLXV> it's awesome
[07:44:35] <SpiritSong> i think i purchased it already ArchrWndrMcRbrt, but i havent read it yet
[07:44:36] <MCMLXV> mid 2000
[07:44:55] <MCMLXV> I'd have to dig up the case to see the date
[07:45:00] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Thought from The Oculatum: "The voyage is not hard 'tis the setting sail"
[07:45:02] <BansheeTears> Loved the good witch too
[07:45:15] <BansheeTears> Finally found a copy of it
[07:45:22] <BansheeTears> Even lance liked it
[07:45:24] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> You've seen those, BansheeTears??
[07:45:33] <BansheeTears> Just the movie
[07:45:33] <raevynskyyemt> It was a good mivie
[07:45:55] <BansheeTears> I don't get the channel, but it was really good
[07:45:59] <MCMLXV> I still have the dvd of the "imaginarium of dr pornaciuss" I burned for you
[07:46:13] <BansheeTears> Never did see that
[07:46:13] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> There have been 6 or 7 movies, and the TV series is going into it's 2nd season on the 17th
[07:46:31] <MCMLXV> it's weird....very, very weird
[07:46:34] <BansheeTears> I only saw the first one
[07:46:39] <BansheeTears> I can do weird
[07:46:47] <BansheeTears> XD
[07:47:13] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I love them because they are the ,ost accurate portrayal of a real witch I've ever seen
[07:47:16] <raevynskyyemt> TV series of King Arthur?

[18:56:33] <Quadpod88> my great aunt, was the most giving and caring person alive
[18:57:07] <Quadpod88> i've seen her give the shirt off her back
[18:57:22] <Quadpod88> and drive home topless
[18:57:35] <Quadpod88> i used to get embarrassed
[18:57:50] <SpiritSong> he sounds like the best influence to be had ^_&

[19:00:27] <SpiritSong> lovely people 
[19:00:36] <Quadpod88> awesome ppl

[19:02:40] <Quadpod88> my mom is the only 1 that knows
[19:02:53] <Quadpod88> well, and my step dad
[19:03:19] <Quadpod88> i think the news would kill them all
[19:03:34] <SpiritSong> thats a shame. that kind of hatred usually comes from fear of the inknown and incorrect info 
[19:03:53] <Quadpod88> and bad expeiriences
[19:04:26] <Quadpod88> we used to have run ins with the darker side of paganism
[19:05:06] <Quadpod88> the real, steal your babies for samhain rites

[19:40:20] <Quadpod88> Henotheism (Greek á¼‘Î½Î±Ï‚ Î¸ÎµÏŒÏ‚ henas theos "one god") is the belief in and worship of a single god while accepting the existence or possible existence of other deities that may also be served. The term was originally coined by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling (1775â€“1854) to depict early stages of monotheism.

[21:42:09] <Quadpod88> kill the 1 to save the many
[21:42:10] <AndChat462336> Good point...
[21:42:14] <CantSirDraggin> the products of disarmament
[21:42:22] <Quadpod88> as far as harm none
[21:42:44] <Quadpod88> wouldn't doing nothing warrant the greater body count?
[21:43:13] <AndChat462336> But can't (eventually) everyone learn to live in peace?
[21:43:19] <CantSirDraggin> doing nothing is in it's way causing harm as well, if you were capable of stopping the additional killing
[21:43:22] <Quadpod88> lol
[21:43:27] <EronGari> how many mass shootings are NOT a setup plot?
[21:43:39] <EronGari> or just plain hoax?
[21:43:56] <Quadpod88> alright, conspiracy aside
[21:44:01] <CantSirDraggin> there is a more grey and unprovable area, from what i've seen
[21:44:02] <AndChat462336> Iona, are you Wiccan?
[21:44:28] <AndChat462336> (I can't see the user list)
[21:44:51] <CantSirDraggin> user list doesn't state that anyway, heh
[21:45:25] <Quadpod88> humans can't live in peace
[21:45:25] <Iona> Why do you ask, AndChat462336?
[21:45:49] <Quadpod88> we're territorial
[21:45:57] <Quadpod88> animals
[21:45:59] <CantSirDraggin> i'm off to nap, catch yall a bit later
[21:46:16] <Iona> sweet dreams, CantSirDraggin 
[21:46:19] <AndChat462336> I'm proposing a new tradition of Wicca that does not accept war
[21:46:44] <Quadpod88> wicca doesn't accept war as i understand it
[21:46:52] <Iona> that sounds good; I'm not looking for someone else's beliefs though...
[21:46:53] <EronGari> they tried that  before, all have been conquered
[21:47:00] <Quadpod88> i do beleive it says harm none
[21:47:17] <AndChat462336> I agree, quadpod
[21:47:28] <Quadpod88> the problem is this
[21:48:06] <Quadpod88> how does one protect the sheep without shooting the wolves?
[21:48:11] <AndChat462336> Erongari, why is it not possible to have a read of Wicca that doesn't believe war is valid?
[21:48:22] <AndChat462336> Trad*
[21:48:46] <EronGari> it is but they eventually fall prey
[21:48:58] <AndChat462336> But quad, I propose that we are not wolves, but people
[21:49:12] <Quadpod88> humans are predators

[21:49:15] <Abraxas> Welcome, Evie. We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.
[21:49:24] <Quadpod88> predators are territorial
[21:49:47] <AndChat462336> But we have self-determination
[21:50:27] <Quadpod88> determination doesn't fight millenia of instinct
[21:50:33] <AndChat462336> I don't war, so, it seems possible that others can decide not to war...?
[21:50:38] <Quadpod88> not well at least
[21:51:11] <Quadpod88> you can't defend yourself or family?
[21:51:56] <Quadpod88> so tell me this
[21:52:22] <Quadpod88> you'd be perfectly willing to die a victim with out a fight
[21:52:32] <AndChat462336> I have issue with that. But I'm working on an argument against that
[21:52:45] <Quadpod88> and let your family die as well
[21:53:14] <EronGari> "Harm None" is nice to strive for but its meaning is ambiguous and debatable if examined too closely, impossible to follow through to everyone's best wishes
[21:53:15] <AndChat462336> There should be self defense, but not war
[21:53:34] <Quadpod88> occasionally war is self defense
[21:53:41] <EronGari> right, and where to draw the lime
[21:53:50] <Quadpod88> exactly
[21:53:51] <EronGari> line*
[21:54:04] <Iona> ummmm question - isn't the war in iraq self-defense of billionaire's investments?...

[21:54:39] <AndChat462336> The war, like all wars, is about money, power, greed

[21:54:47] <Quadpod88> no
[21:54:50] <EronGari> petroluem dollar*
[21:55:04] <Quadpod88> tell me
[21:55:09] <Evie> war is economic
[21:55:15] <Evie> but it's also population control 
[21:55:26] <Quadpod88> the country that fights off an invasion isn't fighting for greed
[21:55:40] <Evie> depends on the war
[21:55:43] <Quadpod88> i agree evie
[21:55:49] <AndChat462336> So, I propose the question, why sign up for such a war, especially if one is Wiccan?
[21:55:54] <Evie> War of Austrian Succession 
[21:56:01] <Evie> both sides invader and the invaded 
[21:56:04] <Evie> were greedy
[21:56:37] <Quadpod88> i signed up to be the one that let go of morality, so my family could be safe
[21:56:46] <Evie> depends on your idea of state
[21:56:50] <Evie> *State
[21:57:00] <Evie> is your religion more important that your citizenship
[21:57:01] <AndChat462336> Evie, if the people removed those evil leaders, isn't it possible not to have war?
[21:57:12] <Evie> who is to say they're evil
[21:57:14] <Iona> no.
[21:57:21] <Quadpod88> nope
[21:57:21] <Evie> Frederick the Great
[21:57:24] <Evie> wasn't evil
[21:57:29] <Quadpod88> war never changes
[21:57:31] <Evie> he wanted what was good for Prussia 
[21:57:38] <Evie> as did Napoleon 
[21:57:39] <EronGari> the Spanish-American War was much about getting control of Manila Harbor, gateway to far east trade, after Chine lifted prohibition of opium to end the opium war - decided the cure was worse than the disease - ended the huge black market profits, so Howard Taft was first regional governor of Philipeans after the war and reinstated prohibition so th
[21:57:39] <EronGari> e drug profits could continue
[21:57:53] <Iona> Hitler was Time Magazine's man of the year...
[21:58:12] <Evie> the goal of war
[21:58:16] <Quadpod88> was it unjust to save the jews?
[21:58:21] <Evie> should always be cultural and political hegemony 
[21:58:36] <Evie> and federalization 
[21:59:10] <Evie> however
[21:59:12] <Evie> diplomacy
[21:59:15] <Quadpod88> i'm not saying war is good, but there are times wher it becomes necissary
[21:59:15] <Evie> is much more effective 
[21:59:32] <Quadpod88> and when diplomacy fails?
[21:59:40] <Evie> then you war
[21:59:48] <Evie> but if conflict is your first move
[21:59:51] <EronGari> don't get suckered by the propaganda used to sell the war - there were other bigger reasons not mentioned publicly that put it there
[21:59:53] <Evie> you're a political moron 
[21:59:56] <Quadpod88> you saction a country many times and they never listen
[22:00:09] <Evie> also 
[22:00:11] <Evie> just as a note
[22:00:16] <Evie> there hasn't been a real war
[22:00:20] <Evie> since 1945
[22:00:26] <Evie> Korea, Vietnam, etc
[22:00:28] <Evie> are not wars
[22:00:34] <Evie> they are minor conflicts 
[22:00:36] <Evie> and proxy battles
[22:00:49] <Evie> and they continue to get smaller
[22:00:59] <Evie> because war is not as lucrative in terms of economic goals

[22:01:35] <Quadpod88> a minor conflict is still a war
[22:01:51] <Evie> sure, but not on any great global scale 
[22:01:57] <Quadpod88> a police action that escalates to violence is a war
[22:02:39] *** Joins: EronGari (EronGari@c280.merc.benz)
[22:02:40] <Abraxas> Welcome, EronGari. There is no birth of consciousness without pain.
[22:02:54] <Evie> the goal of modern politicians and diplomats, should be the eradication of major conflicts, and it is becoming possible because of trade
[22:03:00] <Quadpod88> so go and tell a former soldier that served in these conflicts that he/she isn't a war vet
[22:03:15] <Evie> I'm assuming you are a soldier Quadpod88 
[22:03:20] <Evie> or were
[22:03:21] <Quadpod88> yes
[22:03:24] <Evie> ok
[22:03:26] <AndChat462336> My main issue is (prepare for controversy) that Wicca was hijacked. That Wicca is anti-war
[22:03:36] <Quadpod88> it is
[22:03:40] <Evie> and AndChat462336 is a pacifist?
[22:03:52] <AndChat462336> Absolutely
[22:03:55] <Evie> ok
[22:03:59] <Evie> well I wish you both luck :P
[22:04:05] <Quadpod88> pacifism is great, i support it
[22:04:27] <AndChat462336> And so is Wicca, before the hijacking by fluff and commercialism
[22:04:35] <EronGari> anti-violence is a nice aspiration, but impossible to carry through in the worst situations -
[22:04:59] <Quadpod88> not necissarily
[22:05:22] <EronGari> YOU may never be called upon to fight but others of the same ilk will
[22:05:38] <AndChat462336> Fight for what?
[22:05:46] <Quadpod88> as with the mass shooting example, doing nothing causes the greater harm, so it becomes the duty of the wiccan to defend the weak
[22:05:47] <AndChat462336> Fight for who?
[22:05:50] <EronGari> and when?   those are the real questions
[22:06:09] <AndChat462336> Fight for the perto-dollar?
[22:06:27] <EronGari> all valid questions
[22:06:45] <Quadpod88> i'm not wiccan, and yes i was a soldier, i am also a pacifist
[22:06:51] <AndChat462336> ?
[22:06:56] <Quadpod88> just a realistic one
[22:07:01] <EronGari> if your life and livelihood depended on that economic factor you may have to fight for it
[22:07:03] <AndChat462336> How does that work, quad
[22:07:15] <Quadpod88> i don't fight without a good reason
[22:07:41] <EronGari> and I try never to provoke disharmony, if I can help it
[22:07:53] <AndChat462336> I "think we can do better"
[22:08:05] <Quadpod88> i also eat meat, because i acknowledge my place on the food chain
[22:08:33] <AndChat462336> Power
[22:08:46] <Quadpod88> plants die to make a salad, animals die for our meals, humas die when they try to kill ppl
[22:09:05] <Quadpod88> humans*
[22:09:07] <EronGari> "Harm" just fail to be defined, depending on the situation and individuals involved
[22:09:22] <AndChat462336> I think people can decide to do good
[22:09:35] <Quadpod88> harm can be caused by the failure to defend the weak
[22:09:45] <EronGari> and how many innocent apples have been sacrificed on the wiccan altars?

[22:10:31] <TheAllison> I just had visions of grotesque apple juice running down altars
[22:11:21] <EronGari> would it be true that all matter is devoid of consciousness?  or that only some is?
[22:11:38] <AndChat462336> So, "harm" needs to be better defined if I am to propose a Wicca that never supports war
