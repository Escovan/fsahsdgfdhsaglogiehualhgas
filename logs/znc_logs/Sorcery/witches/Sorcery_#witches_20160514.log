[04:31:00] <Alyria> (Depression/anxiety.)
[04:31:21] <North> a lot of people seem to have that, I've noticed
[04:31:23] <DawnBat> I know that feeling.
[04:31:44] <DawnBat> I'm so tired and fedup....wondering why humanity can't be extinct already
[04:31:52] <Alyria> Unfortunately, mom seems to think that platitudes and prayers will snap her out of it...
[04:32:24] <Alyria> I did convince to take her friend (who I called Aunt for most of my life,) to her doctor to have her medication adjusted
[04:32:30] <Alyria> So hopefully that helps.
[04:32:59] <North> time will tell
[04:33:16] <Alyria> Yeah.
[04:33:50] <North> although maybe she's just responding perfectly naturally to Life and all its myriad gifts
[04:34:43] <Alyria> I suppose so. She's always had to deal with depression and she's currently going through menopause, hormonal change and all that
[04:34:57] <Alyria> So in theory, she may make it out to the otherside.
[04:35:04] <North> exacerbation
[04:35:29] <Alyria> It's all a big chemical soup up in the brain. 
[04:35:40] <North> sure is
[04:36:49] <North> <Brain> *Soup Nazi accent*  "No soup for you!"   <Anyone>  "Fine. Your soup SUCKS."   <Brain>   :|
[04:37:02] <North> twist ending
[04:38:20] <North> in case you change your mind about what you're naming your little melon, I had a thought

[04:42:25] <Alyria> Me either.
[04:42:33] <North> plus tired
[04:42:40] * North cheaply plays the Tired card
[04:43:18] <Alyria> Oh man, I may as well just been a slightly reanimated skin bag the last half of last week and the first half of this week
[04:43:30] <North> lol
[04:43:39] <North> home stretch
[04:43:41] <Alyria> I braced up Wednesday, but man
[04:43:59] <North> another 2-3 weeks?
[04:44:12] <Alyria> I briefed my supervisor on Wednesday, telling him that if it seems like someone of my recent work is piss-poor, it's because it is. You're right.

[04:45:09] <North> good ole maternity leave

[04:46:14] <North> what is it now...6 months or something?
[04:46:40] <Alyria> oh lol
[04:46:41] <Alyria> no
[04:46:54] <Alyria> I get three months, and that's only paid at 80%
[04:46:59] <North> ah, k
[04:47:07] <Alyria> And it also takes all of my accrued vacation time
[04:47:20] <North> hm
[04:48:17] <Alyria> But I still earn it while I'm out, so that's nice. I get 8 hours off for every 80 I work. So I'll have a week off when I get back from leave, at least.

[04:57:33] <SpiritSong> much better than dishonest
[04:57:44] <SpiritSong> hopefully her cousin will learn to be so too
[04:58:17] <Alyria> I think so, anyway. We're working on the hitting. She did stop herself today from hitting and stomped her feet instead, which is what I've been teaching her. So we'll see.

[05:00:18] <Witchit> Remember how I made my bf's present?
[05:00:24] <SpiritSong> yeah?
[05:00:25] <Witchit> I finally finished it
[05:00:29] <Witchit> 36 pages
[05:00:32] <SpiritSong> lmao!
[05:00:34] <SpiritSong> :P
[05:00:38] <Witchit> One tiiiiny problem
[05:00:46] <SpiritSong> sorry couldnt resist, i know its not the end of the story
[05:00:51] <SpiritSong> do go on :)
[05:00:51] <Witchit> I CAN'T ****** PRINT IT
[05:00:57] <SpiritSong> oh damn why not
[05:01:05] <Witchit> My printer broke for no reason
[05:01:20] <Witchit> "Oh, you have something important the day before? HA"
[05:01:34] <North> belated greetings, Gidget
[05:01:41] <Witchit> Hi North :)
[05:02:05] <Witchit> Just expressing my frustration on a broken printer when I need it THE DAY BEFORE
[05:02:18] <North> GO TO HELL, CAPRICIOUS PRINTER
[05:02:18] <SpiritSong> maybe you can give him it on a usb stick
[05:02:24] * North flips a table in a show of support
[05:02:24] <SpiritSong> with just the story on it
[05:02:40] <Witchit> I'm thinking about just e-mailing it
[05:02:46] <Witchit> Through a pdf
[05:02:46] <SpiritSong> that could work
[05:03:01] <Witchit> But I'm so pissed
[05:03:11] <Witchit> I had bought sleeves and a binder and everything
[05:03:17] <North> that really sucks
[05:03:18] <Witchit> I wanted him to actually read it
[05:03:24] <Witchit> And it's like HA
[05:03:29] <North> :/
[05:03:47] <Witchit> I worked for two weeks
[05:03:54] <Witchit> Came up with 36 pages of writing
[05:04:01] <Witchit> AAAAAAAAa
[05:04:07] <North> unacceptable, Life
[05:04:13] <SpiritSong> is there anywhere in town you can go and print it from a usb?
[05:04:47] <Witchit> Well, I have to go to sleep in like 30 minutes. Graduation is at 11 AM. I'd have to get up at 8 AM to go to Staples
[05:05:06] <Alyria> Yeah I am headed to bed I guess.
[05:05:10] <Alyria> Hi/bye Witchit
[05:05:13] <Alyria> bye all
[05:05:17] <Witchit> Bye Alyria!
[05:05:54] <North> happy sleeps, Lyri-Beth
[05:06:00] <Witchit> But yeah, I'd rather take a bat to my printer right now
[05:06:03] <Witchit> But nooooo
[05:06:08] <Witchit> Printers are "important"
[05:06:18] <Witchit> And it would go on my "conscious"
[05:06:25] <Witchit> *conscience

[05:07:01] <Witchit> Thanks North, that means a lot XD

[05:07:22] <SpiritSong> maybe it will work in the morning
[05:07:24] <SpiritSong> :P
[05:07:41] <Witchit> The printer is the problem, but it's also the computer's unfortunately :/
[05:07:52] <Witchit> My computer is 18 years old or older
[05:08:03] <North> if you do decide to email it to him, he'll see how much work you put into it
[05:08:06] <Witchit> And it told us TONIGHT that we have no storage left
[05:08:16] <SpiritSong> 8 am isnt that early though, might be doable?
[05:08:48] <Witchit> I'm probably doing what North says anyway ^ ^" My dad suggested what you did SpiritSong
[05:09:39] <SpiritSong> well, if you're up early might be worth the extra effort ^_^
[05:09:54] <SpiritSong> emails good too
[05:10:08] <North> can always print it up later
[05:10:13] <Witchit> It's kind of also my mom's responsibility to drive me
[05:10:19] <SpiritSong> totally
[05:10:21] <Witchit> Sooooo
[05:10:24] <SpiritSong> ahhhh
[05:10:36] <Witchit> Not that I reject the idea, just that there are too many problems
[05:11:00] <Witchit> I can ask my mom in the morning, but it would suck to do that
[05:11:19] <SpiritSong> yeah, thats too early then
[05:11:40] <Witchit> My mom also offered to drive me, but they always get home by 8 PM or later

[05:12:27] <Witchit> We're still middle class, but my mom is possibly one of the hardest workers I know
[05:12:44] <SpiritSong> i dont get the class system
[05:12:53] <SpiritSong> or why it is of any importance 
[05:12:56] <Witchit> Does Ireland have one?
[05:13:27] <Witchit> We bring it up sometimes because it's important to know where you stand money-wise
[05:13:39] <SpiritSong> no
[05:13:47] <Witchit> To me it shouldn't be a measuring contest who has more money
[05:13:59] <SpiritSong> ah i see
[05:14:03] <Witchit> But just the amount you have personally :/
[05:14:24] <Witchit> That's why I tell someone "I'm middle class" instead of "I have X amount of money"
[05:14:49] <SpiritSong> hmm
[05:15:28] <SpiritSong> i hate when people integrate it into their "social class"
[05:15:45] <SpiritSong> obviously not what you're doing
[05:15:46] <Witchit> Although it could also be that I've gotten that habit rubbed off on me from the upper class we live around
[05:16:00] <Witchit> Yeah, I'd never do that
[05:16:33] <SpiritSong> i know
[05:16:38] <North> Witchit, I tried another loser ice cream today
[05:16:45] <North> Key Lime...what the hell was I thinking
[05:16:48] <SpiritSong> im glad we dont have a class system here lol
[05:16:57] <Witchit> Hahahahaha North, was it the same brand? XD
[05:17:03] <North> nope!
[05:17:06] <SpiritSong> everyone just mixes with everyone. youd like it Witchit
[05:17:24] <SpiritSong> icecream!!
[05:17:50] <Witchit> I probably would :) I'm really sick of my town playing "who's got the most money in our wallets"
[05:17:57] <North> I can scarcely believe that substandard ice cream actually exists in this world
[05:18:02] <SpiritSong> i dont blame you.
[05:18:07] <SpiritSong> id be sick of it too
[05:18:28] * North drones on about the frozen dairy treat tragedy

[05:18:41] <Witchit> It's really sad when most stores here I can't afford to buy from, but everyone else can
[05:18:43] <SpiritSong> what flavour northy
[05:18:47] <Witchit> -hugs SpiritSong- :)
[05:18:54] <North> 'Key Lime'
[05:19:02] <North> blech
[05:19:08] <Witchit> Key Lime is only good for yogurt
[05:19:16] <Witchit> Other than that, no XD
[05:19:16] <MissSuugar> i love key lime but you need to do it in a sherbert
[05:19:20] <SpiritSong> meh stuff is just stuff. good friends and family is what matters 
[05:19:22] * North notes
[05:19:39] <SpiritSong> unless its art supplies lolz
[05:20:04] <Witchit> I know SpiritSong, but sometimes it can really affect your self-consciousness
[05:20:26] <Witchit> In middle school, there was a girl with a movie theater in her house
[05:20:42] <Witchit> And she said to me, "Your house has one floor and a basement? Why?"
[05:20:53] * North jots "Yogurt sherbert YES Key Lime btw" on a ripped piece of paper towel
[05:21:06] <SpiritSong> well, don't let them make you feel inferior because you're not inferior to them.
[05:21:06] <MissSuugar> dude
[05:21:25] <MissSuugar> ok another dream reading
[05:21:28] <MissSuugar> brb
[05:21:33] <SpiritSong> at the end of the day stuff is going to mean notbing....can their stuff be there for them when they need a friend? :P nope!!!
[05:21:40] <Witchit> Heheheh
[05:21:50] <SpiritSong> can her movie theatre spend time with her? ;)
[05:21:51] <North> plus, most movies suck
[05:21:54] <Witchit> It didn't help that I had no friends back then XD
[05:22:05] <SpiritSong> well you do now :)
[05:22:09] <Witchit> Aw :D
[05:22:38] <Witchit> Well, she was my friend, and I didn't want to use her for her money
[05:22:47] <Witchit> Especially not her theater
[05:23:06] <SpiritSong> i doubt she would think youd do that
[05:23:40] <Witchit> She was a bit...shallow. I mean, not that she was too mean, but she did get REALLY paranoid over time
[05:23:57] <Witchit> She also gossiped a lot, so a lot of my other friends and I really feared her
[05:24:20] <Witchit> She was also the one who caused the most drama
[05:24:30] <Witchit> So...
[05:24:38] <SpiritSong> ahhh
[05:24:51] <SpiritSong> she might grow out of that :P
[05:24:55] <SpiritSong> hopefully
[05:25:10] <Witchit> Well, I lost touch with her when I went to a different school
[05:25:14] <SpiritSong> least you're richer in knowing not to gossip
[05:25:20] <Witchit> :)
[05:25:22] <SpiritSong> :)
[05:25:31] <Witchit> Unfortunately, I bullied for three days
[05:25:39] <Witchit> It was the worst feeling in the world
[05:25:55] <Witchit> I didn't gossip, but I did attempt to punch someone
[05:26:16] <SpiritSong> thats sucks :/ bullying is horrible
[05:26:17] <Witchit> It was scary, and my friends didn't talk to me in weeks
[05:26:44] <SpiritSong> because of her gossip?
[05:27:27] <Witchit> Well, I punched a bully because he took my bat mitzvah book and ripped it up, and my friends got mad because the girl who owned the theater was friends with him
[05:27:57] <SpiritSong> lol...good on you
[05:28:15] <Witchit> Oh no, I felt like a jerk after I punched him
[05:28:29] <Witchit> No one should physically hurt anyone just because of bullying
[05:28:39] <SpiritSong> no, you're right
[05:29:02] <SpiritSong> but im glad you stood up for yourself all the same
[05:29:12] <SpiritSong> but you aren't a jerk
[05:29:29] <Witchit> Well I felt like that at the time
[05:29:52] <Witchit> And the fact my "friends" didn't back me up was scary
[05:30:25] <SpiritSong> that wasnt nice
[05:30:28] <Witchit> He told them that I punched him for no reason, and unfortunately they didn't believe me over him
[05:30:34] <SpiritSong> :( 
[05:30:39] <Witchit> Yeah...
[05:30:44] <SpiritSong> people often lie sadly
[05:30:56] <Witchit> I know that too well...I've lied too
[05:31:05] <SpiritSong> everyone has lied
[05:31:19] <Witchit> It's an awful feeling though, and in the end all you want to do is just tell the truth
[05:31:25] <North> that Key Lime ice cream wasn't so bad
[05:31:29] * North lies his ass off
[05:31:32] <SpiritSong> yup i hear you there, im the same
[05:31:35] <Witchit> Hahahaha North XD
[05:32:10] <Witchit> Yeah, I used to lie a lot
[05:32:26] <Witchit> I was a dumb kid :P
[05:32:32] <SpiritSong> the important thing is that you worked on it :)
[05:32:48] <Witchit> Yeah, I'm a LOT better than I was in the past
[05:33:13] <Witchit> But when you break someone's trust, that's one of the worst things you can do
[05:34:07] <SpiritSong> agreed
[05:34:18] <Witchit> I gotta go to bed
[05:34:24] <Witchit> Goodnight!
