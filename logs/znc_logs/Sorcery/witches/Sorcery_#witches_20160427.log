[07:10:32] <Iona> good evening CantSirDraggin
[07:10:56] <Iona> you were the only one; I'm grateful I wasn't sufficiently pun-ished to my own standards.
[07:10:58] <CantSirDraggin> cause one pun is never enough, as you well know, lol
[07:11:03] <Iona> Yeah :)
[07:11:13] <CantSirDraggin> well damn
[07:11:29] <CantSirDraggin> you need more smartasses by this time next year in your fb
[07:11:52] <CantSirDraggin> as your elder, i'm going to call it an assignment
[07:12:16] <CantSirDraggin> collect more smartasses....or something....or another?
[07:12:34] <Iona> do intelligent democrats count?
[07:12:42] <CantSirDraggin> definately not
[07:12:50] <CantSirDraggin> and that's an oxymoron anyway
[07:13:02] <Iona> I know!

[07:14:52] <Iona> since the leaders of the Democratic National Convention of CA didn't know that the Federal Reserve is a private organization, yeah, I'm inclined to agree...

[07:15:02] <Iona> yeah...
[07:16:09] <CantSirDraggin> if i don't have to tell one more person that 47.something% of peeps getting money from the govt is a bad thing and why, i'll be content
[07:16:24] <Iona> :)
[07:16:45] <CantSirDraggin> the good part to this cycle is the outsiders though
[07:17:17] <CantSirDraggin> everyone is getting a good view of how the two parties make noone's vote count for much
[07:17:28] <Iona> ehhh....  I hate to burst the bubble...  but Trump doing what he did and getting away with it will only encourage more in the future...
[07:17:34] <Iona> yeah.
[07:17:45] <CantSirDraggin> trump is playing a roll
[07:17:53] <CantSirDraggin> as much as i'm not a trump fan
[07:18:07] <CantSirDraggin> but in primaries you have to activate the base
[07:18:19] <Iona> yeah
[07:18:22] <Iona> and it worked.
[07:18:50] <CantSirDraggin> won't in a general, as is, but his handler has made statements of how that would be different
[07:19:35] <CantSirDraggin> and i would love to see him school hilary on what he just did, and point it out that it's what she's done for decades
[07:19:52] <CantSirDraggin> though i'd rather have cruz
[07:20:45] <CantSirDraggin> back to the constitution seems like a good idea when unfunded liabilities are reaching into 400%gdp
[07:21:06] <Iona> I know you're talking about Ted Cruz, but I was just thinking "Tom Cruise for president would be such an ego stroker for the Scientologists..."
[07:21:14] <Iona> I agree...
[07:21:38] <CantSirDraggin> lmao, if it were tom cruise, the debates would be funny as hell
[07:21:47] <Iona> Yeah lol...
[07:22:24] <CantSirDraggin> there'd be a good, but factually...ummm...stretched movie about it later too
[07:22:42] <Iona> lol...  
[07:23:22] <CantSirDraggin> so many actors/actresses are good at what they do then open their mouths on politic and reveal how completely uninformed they are
[07:23:52] <CantSirDraggin> your job is all image....just stfu between roles
[07:23:59] <Iona> "The Thetans made me do it!"
[07:24:06] <CantSirDraggin> be rich, have kids
[07:24:15] <CantSirDraggin> buy realllly nice stuff
[07:24:32] <CantSirDraggin> hahaha
[07:24:45] <CantSirDraggin> it's wierd al's fault for doing the song foil
[07:28:45] <CantSirDraggin> so wtf no ops on?
[07:29:20] <CantSirDraggin> the process of picking ops is supposed to include this not happening
[07:29:58] <Iona> Agreed...
[07:29:59] <CantSirDraggin> i know june has been waiting untill it's safe...
[07:30:06] <CantSirDraggin> :P
[07:31:22] <CantSirDraggin> or not
[07:31:24] <CantSirDraggin> nm
[07:34:29] <CantSirDraggin> kinda surprised Gehenna hasn't informed us of the second coming of cain
[07:34:52] <Iona> Gehenna?
[07:35:07] <CantSirDraggin> white wolf v:tm
[07:35:30] <CantSirDraggin> they say cain was maybe the first vampire
[07:35:34] <Iona> Ahh...  well...
[07:35:38] <CantSirDraggin> gehenna is his ruturn
[07:36:04] <CantSirDraggin> there was a great expansion book about cain and able from his point of view
[07:36:40] <Iona> I'm more for firsthand experiences...
[07:36:43] <CantSirDraggin> sacrificing chutes and such was not good enough, he needed to sacrifice from what he loved
[07:36:51] <CantSirDraggin> so he did
[07:37:08] <CantSirDraggin> god didn't care so much for him sacrificing his brother
[07:38:21] <CantSirDraggin> then lilith, and vampires and all hell breaking loose
[07:38:43] <CantSirDraggin> fun game if you get enough of the right peeps playing
[07:39:50] <CantSirDraggin> we had a larp that ran with 150 or so peeps a week for 7-8 years here
[07:39:59] <Iona> that's pretty good
[07:40:30] <CantSirDraggin> phenominal given that we onle have like 200k peeps in total and in the bible belt
[07:40:43] <Iona> :)
[07:41:30] <CantSirDraggin> i suppose part of being the tech center of the south, if not for america
[07:42:06] <CantSirDraggin> if someone launches a missle and we intercept it in route that came from here
[07:42:22] * Iona smiles
[07:42:25] <Iona> that's good
[07:42:34] <CantSirDraggin> most of what nasa puts in orbit or beyond comes from here as far as engineering goes
[07:43:15] <CantSirDraggin> all cause von braun defected and moved here so many years ago, heh
[07:43:51] <Iona> history is a very useful tool
[07:44:13] <CantSirDraggin> in this case maybe habit
[07:44:46] <CantSirDraggin> or do we call it tradition already
[07:45:07] <CantSirDraggin> i just do tires
[07:45:14] <Iona> tires it is!...  
[07:46:19] <CantSirDraggin> though on many occasions more than one would thing, i have heard someone utter the phrase, 'It doesn't take a rocket scientist to....' and hear the reply , i AM A Rocket scientist'
[07:46:50] <CantSirDraggin> sadly most of the time it's about how to install a spare tire on a car
[07:46:53] <Iona> I like the phrase "rocket surgeon" instead of "rocket scientist"
[07:47:01] <Iona> it's much more... lively...
[07:47:25] <CantSirDraggin> the peeps they use and surgery of any sort may be a bad idea
[07:47:38] <Iona> My father did live surgery on rockets...  
[07:47:42] <CantSirDraggin> less than lively would likely happen
[07:47:48] <Iona> to see how well their tracking systems worked...
[07:48:33] <CantSirDraggin> that croud has a lot of booksmarts and little common sense it seems
[07:48:38] <CantSirDraggin> crowd*
[07:49:09] <Iona> true...
[07:50:46] <CantSirDraggin> but the point fo nearish a century has been to focus on one small thing, and ffs do not become self sufficient
[07:51:13] <Iona> yeah...
[07:52:00] <CantSirDraggin> given any kind of apocolypse, zombie or otherwise, i feel few outside of the farming community would last long at all
[07:52:48] <CantSirDraggin> rocket scientists would all go early as far as i can tell
[07:53:19] <Iona> "survive the Zombie Apocalypse!  Become a farmer!  (2 months later:  I'm farming brains!)"
[07:53:46] <CantSirDraggin> virtually noone knows how to feed thmselves anymore
[07:54:09] <Iona> it's beyond unreasonable...  I agree...
[07:54:34] <CantSirDraggin> i grew up in a community where like half of everyone hunted, then did city life later
[07:55:14] <CantSirDraggin> almost everyone i have known for a coupe decades would be completely useless if the food supply broke down

[17:17:29] <Abraxas> Welcome, Hrafnbjorn. Every decision you make is not a decision about what to do; it’s a decision about who you are.
[17:17:43] <Witchit> Hraf!
[17:17:57] <Witchit> Yo dude :D I have a question for you!
[17:18:00] <Hrafnbjorn> good morning, Witchit, how are ya?
[17:18:34] <Witchit> I'm great! I want to know more about runes...should I start them up? I've been really interested in divination, and I thought you might be a good person to talk to
[17:20:20] <Hrafnbjorn> well, first thing ya should understand is that runic divinatin is a modern practice... theres no evidence of it in hostoric runology
[17:20:48] <Witchit> I didn't know that 0_o
[17:21:03] <Hrafnbjorn> so you will find a contradiction in the lore for divination, and the lore provided in the sagas
[17:21:43] <Witchit> Gotcha...
[17:21:46] <Hrafnbjorn> To put it simply, runic divination revolves around a Christian/Medditeranean time theory
[17:22:40] <Hrafnbjorn> In Heathen time theory, one cannot divine the future, they can however discern the luck involved in a given action based on what was, and what is
[17:23:12] <Hrafnbjorn> plus, the nature of how each rune is defined makes them very vague for divinatory use
[17:23:45] <Hrafnbjorn> and the modern books about runic divination reduce them down to keywords, which more often than not do not match the provoded lore
[17:24:42] <Hrafnbjorn> the first rune, for example is fe/fehu, which is the mutual exchange between 2 things... in the modern aspect it is reduced down to 'gold' or 'wealth'
[17:25:13] <Hrafnbjorn> so if you are divining, and it appears, it would only show a mutual exchange
[17:25:29] <Witchit> Right...I did do some research, and I can see why it's vague....like that X rune is the bonding between two people
[17:25:30] <Witchit> I thin

[17:26:03] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, all of the runes are about interaction.

[17:27:26] <Raggiedmon> Ello
[17:27:31] <Witchit> I asked Hrafnbjorn about starting up runes as another divination tool
[17:27:41] <Witchit> And he's just giving me info on it :)
[17:27:46] <Hrafnbjorn> and back in the late 1800's there was a big attempt to Germanify everything, and a man named Guido Von List took the tarot, and tried to make it a Germanic thing, by substituting the runes.  So, to understand runic divination, you are better off studying tarot first, since you wont find anything in the lore

[17:29:06] <ExTaZyTi> nice
[17:29:07] <ExTaZyTi> :)
[17:29:44] <Witchit> Hrafnbjorn: Would it not work out then, because I would be good enough with tarot?
[17:30:06] <Witchit> Because I've been thinking about expanding a little :/
[17:30:32] <Hrafnbjorn> if it works for you, use it

[17:31:16] <Hrafnbjorn> I was just sayin that the structure, and theory behond it is from tarot, so studying that helps... afetr tarot, get the lore from the end of Havamal, and the rune poems
[17:31:29] <Witchit> Rune poems? :)
[17:31:37] <Hrafnbjorn> be warned though, there is no lore at all for the Elder Futhark, even though most books about runes focus on them
[17:32:06] <Witchit> And what do you mean by lore?
[17:32:19] <Hrafnbjorn> yes there are 3 sets of rune poems, 2 for the Younger Futhark (One Old Norse, the other Icelandic), and a set of poems for the Saxon Futhark
[17:32:42] <Hrafnbjorn> runic philosophy was recorded in several sagas, and the rune poems
[17:33:07] <Hrafnbjorn> the most important saga for runes is Havamal (from Poetic Edda)
[17:33:50] <Witchit> Gotcha...I'll look them up before deciding. I guess I tend to jump in a little too soon without knowing enough first ^ ^"

[17:34:54] <Hrafnbjorn> there is nothing WRONG with using them for divination, its just that its not a traditional use, so you wont find lore in a form that is easy to aply to divination
[17:34:58] <ExTaZyTi> Witchit: thanks :)
[17:35:00] <Hrafnbjorn> wb ExTaZyTi
[17:35:08] <ExTaZyTi> Hrafnbjorn: thanks :)
[17:35:38] <Witchit> Ohhh, okay
[17:36:07] <Witchit> So it'll be harder to translate because there isn't enough information? ^ ^"
[17:36:36] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, and the structure of the info would be vague for divination
[17:37:39] <Witchit> Right....I may just stick to tarot then, but I'm starting to think that runes are kind of calling to me...
[17:37:56] <Hrafnbjorn> to give example, here is the rune poem for the first rune, fe:
[17:37:56] <Hrafnbjorn> Wealth is a source of discord among kinsmen;
[17:37:56] <Hrafnbjorn> the wolf lives in the forest.
[17:38:49] <Witchit> Interesting
[17:38:56] <Hrafnbjorn> so, the poem doesnt give much insight into its possible divinatory meaning... but ya can still take meaning...
[17:38:59] <Hrafnbjorn> for example
[17:39:59] <Hrafnbjorn> if it comes up, one could take it to mean that wealth, when NOT exchanged, causes a breakdown of the folk structure, as all value is based on exchange, without thsat exchange, there is no value

[17:42:22] <Hrafnbjorn> orn> when you look at the lore (for that rune) in the big picture, you get better image of it... it is an evolvedexpression of the proto-Indo-European 'bepo' which meanslivestock's ability to provide for the folk, as well as the folks effort to  support the livestock

[17:54:05] <Witchit> Why do you have such a bad connection? I never asked :/
[17:54:54] <Hrafnbjorn> there is a radar statin down the street, which kills all sort of radio signal, and since only internet access I can get here is sattelite, it kills the signal a lot
[17:55:10] <ExTaZyTi> i put my laptop to sleep without wanting
[17:55:12] <ExTaZyTi> :)
[17:55:37] <Witchit> -shakes fist at both radar waves and computer programming-
[17:56:41] <Witchit> Anyway, Hraf, you should write books with your knowledge of stuffs
[17:56:54] <Witchit> Runes would be really cool to read about
[17:57:19] <Hrafnbjorn> I have tried, but I am too unorganized, and ramble too much... so each chapter ends up being like a book itself, lol
[17:58:27] <Witchit> Hahaha, I get the same way with articles on certain games and their stories XD Someone said 'write an article on Wheatley's transformation in Portal 2' and like a derp I said okay. It was five pages.
[17:58:36] <Witchit> Safe to say, no one wanted to read it XD
[17:58:50] <Hrafnbjorn> plus, when it comes to runes, I tend to bore folk cause I get into linguistics and such, plus most folk dont wanna hear about 'tradition,' since they are not Heathen, and think Heathen lore is irrelivent to their practice (even when using Heathen stuff like runes)
[17:59:18] <Witchit> I'll listen to it ^ ^
[17:59:45] <Witchit> I've always been interested in religion and its tradition
[17:59:46] <Witchit> Plus it's all about finding the right audience
[17:59:52] <Hrafnbjorn> I may get a book written someday, who knows :)
[18:00:19] <Witchit> I can recommend a decent program that can actually help organize you :)
[18:00:24] <Witchit> It's for free too
[18:00:42] <Hrafnbjorn> I have a few that folk have suggested over time
[18:01:45] <Witchit> Well it's called ywrite6. If there are a lot of people who have already offered programs, I'll just say it's an option :P
[18:02:19] <Hrafnbjorn> runes are a contentious where it contradicts Thorsson, because folk are not readily familiar with his history
[18:03:04] <Witchit> People have done theses on plenty of things where they just give their opinion on things
[18:03:06] <Hrafnbjorn> he founded the Rnegild, which he was eventualy pushed out of cause of his underhanded manipulations, so since his books are so popullar, folk just assume he is the autority
[18:04:13] <Hrafnbjorn> folk dont typicaly actualy study them, they just pick up Thorsson's books, look at the keywords, then write their own book
[18:04:51] <Hrafnbjorn> so they dont know HIS history of manipulating them away from the actual lore in favor of attracting them to Temple of Set
[18:05:12] <Witchit> Then challenge it :) There's nothing wrong with a different opinion, especially since you're smart enough to back it up
[18:07:05] <Hrafnbjorn> I challenged it in the past, and within the Heathen community there has been good progress to get back to the tradition, but in the Neo-Pagan community there is the belief that opinioin trumps tradition (which is true for the individual) so they never get past the lies which are far easier to understand

[18:08:17] <Witchit> Well conversation is one thing, but an essay-like book should be a lot more interesting
[18:08:26] <Witchit> But I'm not pushing you into anything :)
[18:08:43] <Hrafnbjorn> one of the very popular authors for runes geared to the neo-pagan community is Ralph Blume, who has admited to never actualy studying them.  He made up an extra rune, which is blank, that he says is 'wyrd' or fate...
[18:09:40] <Hrafnbjorn> there can be no blank rune when you do actualy study runology cause runes are NOT and alphabet, they are primal laws of interaction, so there can be no blank.  This is just an example of how folk
[18:09:51] <Hrafnbjorn> just look at the surface and never actualy study
[18:10:32] <Hrafnbjorn> the alphabet are rune-staves not the runes themselves
[18:11:09] <Witchit> Ohhh
[18:11:33] <Witchit> That's a little sad...it reminds me a little bit about the creator of wicca
[18:11:50] <Hrafnbjorn> another thing that discourages me from writing a book is that I have tried many times to start study groups, and nobody participates, but bug me for more... They dont actualy read and digest what I provide, they just want more to save on hard drive
[18:12:57] <Hrafnbjorn> the neo-pagan movement is very destructive to Heathenism, which is why ya dont find many Heathens on general pagan forums and such... they get put off by the butchery
[18:13:15] <Hrafnbjorn> even Christians had less negative impact on Heathenism than neo-paganism has
[18:13:38] <Witchit> Well...I'd love to join your study group, but I'm probably not as advanced as you, so it'd be very hard to catch up...plus a lot of the time it's hard to get people to join a group
[18:14:36] <Hrafnbjorn> its not about being advanced, I do it for the sake of exchanging ideas.  Sometimes an untrained mind can come up with ideas that the trained mind does not
[18:14:57] <Witchit> Eheheheh ^ ^" I'm still a bit unqualified, but that is true
[18:16:04] <Witchit> Maybe a better way of working with people during a study group is to make it a little more fun. Not like word puzzles or anything, but making things a little less dense
[18:16:14] <Witchit> Also not saying to dumb anything down
[18:16:58] <Witchit> Try a wider topic
[18:17:10] <Witchit> *wider topics
[18:17:43] <Hrafnbjorn> the way I have dealt with it in past is to provide articles about the lore, then leave the opinioin side to conversation.  I dont like to write articles about my opinion, cause it makes it feel like I am dictating that opinion, but that falls apart when there is no convo
[18:18:26] <Witchit> Yeah, I gotcha...it's hard...maybe they're intimidated by the type of articles?
[18:18:36] <Hrafnbjorn> perhaps
[18:19:08] <Hrafnbjorn> Im not sure how to provide the lore in a different fashion though
[18:19:15] <Witchit> Hm...

[18:19:31] <Abraxas> Welcome, ExTaZyTi. The person who looks outward dreams, the person who looks inward awakens.
[18:19:43] <Hrafnbjorn> wb ExTaZyTi
[18:19:45] <Witchit> That's a good point. Maybe some modern news on runes or witchcraft
[18:19:52] <Witchit> Hi ExTaZyTi!
[18:20:19] <Witchit> Or something like examples rather than actual full on topics
[18:20:22] <Hrafnbjorn> modern news about runes is usually just linguistics... a new rune stone is translated, etc...
[18:20:57] <Hrafnbjorn> plus its so focused on specific group of cultures, many folk miss the signifigance
[18:21:19] <Witchit> Well at least you gave it a go :)
[18:21:54] <Witchit> Either way, I think if you write a blog series about it on alternative faiths you could get an audience
[18:22:02] <Hrafnbjorn> for example, most runic artefacts have been either land claims, or love letters... the latter was illegal up to end of Viking Period, so folk dont see the signifigance of why they are so hard to translate
[18:22:06] <Witchit> You could start out small ^ ^
[18:22:17] <Witchit> Ah
[18:22:48] <Witchit> Well...hmm...
[18:23:26] <Witchit> Like I said, blog it or broadcast it...I'd love to hear what you have to say, and the people here are very supportive

[18:30:13] <Witchit> I don't know where to go now for translation
[18:30:40] <Witchit> Or where to get the right runes
[18:30:52] <Hrafnbjorn> there are some great books available, they are just not the popular ones
[18:31:09] <Witchit> That doesn't matter to me, as long as I get the right information
[18:31:13] <Hrafnbjorn> Anne Groa Sheffield, and RI Page are good and trustworthy authors
[18:31:46] <Hrafnbjorn> RI Page doesnt inlucde much as far as magic use though
[18:31:55] <Hrafnbjorn> *include
[18:31:57] <Witchit> So they'd have translations for the runes?
[18:32:03] <Hrafnbjorn> yes
[18:32:13] <Witchit> Cool :)
[18:32:15] <Hrafnbjorn> you can find Havamal, and the rune poems free online too
[18:32:28] <Witchit> Havamal?
[18:32:35] <Witchit> Are those a type of rune?
[18:32:38] <Hrafnbjorn> this is a great site to study from:  http://www.arild-hauge.com/eindex.htm
[18:32:45] <Witchit> Thanks! Clicking now
[18:33:18] <Witchit> Bookmarked
[18:33:23] <Hrafnbjorn> Havamal is a poem where Odin discovers the runes, and lists uses... the rune section is at the end though, verse 138 foreward
[18:33:53] <Witchit> Thanks! This is really useful!
[18:34:09] <Hrafnbjorn> no prob :)

[19:07:14] <ExTaZyTi> H- i don't know what you are talking about
[19:07:32] <Iona> Witchit: what is stopping you from meditating?
[19:08:01] <Witchit> I don't know...I've been a little more inactive with my studies, something seems to be blocking my connection with the spirits as well
[19:08:13] <Witchit> Like, I can't remember my dreams as often
[19:08:18] <ExTaZyTi> Witchit: i have been meditate a lot but i don't know for what i can use this :)
[19:09:05] <ExTaZyTi> Witchit: it is better to not remember the dreams
[19:09:07] <Witchit> I know I helped a spirit last night, but it's been getting hard to help when I can't remember as much or even see spirits normally at time
[19:09:09] <Witchit> *times
[19:09:22] <Iona> keep putting in the effort, Witchit; in the long run, that will be honored...
[19:09:36] <Witchit> ExTaZyTi: I actually think it's better off that I do...I like helping spirits
[19:09:38] <Iona> even if it doesn't work well in the short term...
[19:09:52] <Iona> (also, refinements in perspectives help...)
[19:10:26] <Witchit> Yeah..I don't know how to undo this spiritual block though. Maybe it's because I'm not meditating enough or practicing my witchcraft
[19:10:50] <Witchit> It just feels very unnatural not having prophetic dreams and suck
[19:10:52] <Witchit> *such
[19:10:59] <ExTaZyTi> Witchit: with what you help spirits :)
[19:11:49] <ExTaZyTi> Witchit: before time i had prophetic dreams and i hate it i was know all my day what it will be it very sux :)
[19:11:52] <Witchit> ExTaZyTi: I like to keep them company and guide them on their path to a better existence....being able to be there for another makes me feel happy just to keep someone in a lot of pain company
[19:12:33] <Witchit> That sucks Ex....it was hard for me at first, but I got used to it
[19:12:44] <Witchit> Now without talking and guiding, it just feels...empty
[19:13:33] <Witchit> Plus, it's healthier that I meditate and everything :/
[19:14:30] <ExTaZyTi> Witchit: maybe this kind of dreams are send to us when we must know something....

[19:43:31] <Witchit> Good
[19:43:39] <Witchit> That is awesome, all power to you Quad :)
[19:43:53] <AntleredGirl> Well, thank you, ExTaZyTi.
[19:43:55] <Quadpod88> and i respect the animal i harvest
[19:44:08] <Witchit> Then that's, for me, the right kind of hunter
[19:44:19] <Witchit> At least he or she has some respect
[19:44:24] <ExTaZyTi> AntleredGirl: :)
[19:44:39] <Witchit> Not trying to be mean though, I just hate killing for sport
[19:44:56] <Quadpod88> i kill for food
[19:45:09] <Quadpod88> i just enjoy the "sport"
[19:45:48] <AntleredGirl> Nothing wrong with being the apex predator. 
[19:45:59] <AntleredGirl> Hunting is a human tradition as much as gardening. 
[19:46:03] <Quadpod88> nope
[19:46:07] <Witchit> I wish that people stopped hunting something endangered, that's all I'm sayin
[19:46:09] <Quadpod88> yep
[19:46:53] <Witchit> If people are killing endangered animals for sport or just for one body part without use, then it's wrong in my eyes
[19:47:02] <AntleredGirl> Well, yes.
[19:47:10] <Quadpod88> i don't kill endangered animals, unless they put me in a position where i'm endangered
[19:47:20] <Witchit> Then that makes sense to me
[19:47:41] <Witchit> Animals are REALLY important to the ecosystem
[19:48:13] <Quadpod88> like i said, good hunters are forces for wildlife conservation, we don't want hunting to end because everything is dead
[19:48:36] <Witchit> Well I know that :) It's just an issue that I have with some hunters
[19:49:04] <Quadpod88> some hunters are total jerkoffs
[19:49:17] <Witchit> Am I the only one who hates Duck Dynasty?
[19:49:28] <Quadpod88> and i've dealt with poachers and such
[19:49:38] <Witchit> Like, these people blew up a beaver dam for NO REASON other than pretty explosion
[19:49:41] <Quadpod88> never watch it
[19:50:01] <Quadpod88> beavers are so important
[19:50:02] <AntleredGirl> Watched five minutes of it and had to "go home and feed the cats" 
[19:50:18] <Witchit> Yeah, I know the feeling
[19:51:26] <Witchit> They're killing for sport, and they're being awful people on top of that
[19:51:29] <Quadpod88> i go to junkyards to make pretty explosion
[19:51:56] <Quadpod88> don't fall into their trap
[19:52:02] <Witchit> The worst part about that part was that it was their new video game
[19:52:09] <Witchit> *for
[19:52:12] <Witchit> *for their
[19:52:43] <Quadpod88> ...
[19:52:53] <Witchit> I know right?!!
[19:53:10] <Witchit> (By the way, the game was aaaawwwfuuuulll)
[19:53:43] <Quadpod88> never played it
[19:53:47] <Witchit> Good.
[19:54:02] <Witchit> Don't pick it up, don't even buy it. Worst game of 2014
[19:54:21] <Witchit> All they did was simulate hunting things with cutscenes of hunting
[19:54:35] <Quadpod88> i just picked up the deadpool game
[19:54:40] <Witchit> It's....ehhhhh
[19:54:50] <Witchit> The humor is nice, but that's kind of it
[19:55:13] <Quadpod88> <3 deadpool
[19:55:23] <Witchit> Deadpool is indeed awesome :)
[19:55:41] <Witchit> My favorite superhero though is Spiderman
[19:55:58] <Quadpod88> deadpool and tmnt
[19:56:08] <Witchit> Tmnt!
[19:56:19] <Witchit> I love the 2012 and 80's show :D
[19:56:31] <Quadpod88> ....
[19:56:44] <Witchit> (2012 being NOT the movie)
[19:56:54] <Quadpod88> the 80's/90's movie series
[19:57:03] <Witchit> Nonono
[19:57:09] <Quadpod88> by far, still the best
[19:57:13] <Witchit> I love the 80's series and the movies
[19:57:30] <Witchit> I meant not the Michael Bay one
[19:58:02] <Witchit> I loved Jim Henson's costumes especially :D
[19:58:16] <Quadpod88> michael bay lost all my repect
[19:58:23] <Quadpod88> all of it
[19:58:37] <Witchit> He lost my respect with the Transformers movies in the beginning
[19:59:04] <Quadpod88> eh
[19:59:33] <Witchit> They are the most racist, sexist, mindless movies I have ever seen

[20:00:04] <Quadpod88> they casted the worst april o'neal in history
[20:00:05] <Witchit> Right next to Twilight...I think Twilight is a different kind of stupid, but Michael Bay just seems more offensive
[20:00:19] <Witchit> Ohhh boy, Meghan Fox
[20:00:44] <Quadpod88> ugh
[20:00:50] <Witchit> Personally, I don't hate-hate her, but she is definitely up there as a terrible actress
[20:00:55] <Quadpod88> and used to think she was hot
[20:01:17] <Quadpod88> until she was april o'neal
[20:01:38] <Witchit> As someone who is bisexual, I thought she looks like a barbie :/

[20:02:29] <Witchit> Honestly, it's really not just her fault. I think it's Michael Bay in general
[20:02:38] <Witchit> He was REALLY mean to his writers
[20:02:56] <Witchit> I don't hate his writers basically because Michael just doesn't know how to shoot a movie
[20:02:58] <Quadpod88> she could of of put alot more attitude in it
[20:03:20] <Witchit> I heard Anna Kendrick was going to be April, and I would have liked that much more
[20:03:25] <Quadpod88> april is supposed to be feisty
[20:03:44] <Witchit> Yeah, looks do not always equal personality
[20:04:06] <Quadpod88> yep
[20:04:08] <Witchit> Whoopi Goldburg was also a really weird choice for her boss
[20:04:21] <Quadpod88> but she should be an actress
[20:04:23] <Witchit> She was the best actress in there, but that's not saying much
[20:04:47] <Quadpod88> her boss was supposed to be a man
[20:04:52] <Witchit> Exactly!
[20:04:59] <Witchit> That's what happened in the 80's show
[20:05:18] <Quadpod88> i'm not being sexist, but thats the story
[20:05:20] <Witchit> I always laughed at the boss because he was actually unintentionally hilarious
[20:05:36] <Quadpod88> it's a soft spined man
[20:05:46] <Witchit> "And you haven't brought me...-epic closeup- DIDDLY SQUAT!"
[20:06:09] <Witchit> I was like "watch out we got a bad*** over here" XD
[20:06:38] <Witchit> I was genuinely looking forward to silly stuff
[20:06:47] <Witchit> Andddd then the foot have guns.
[20:06:55] <Witchit> THEY ARE NINJAS PEOPLE
[20:07:03] <Quadpod88> in close, maichael bay is screwing up the new generation
[20:07:30] <Witchit> Well...not really just Bay to me
[20:07:41] <Witchit> It's a lot of stupid stuff going on with the media in general

[20:10:05] <Abraxas> Welcome, ExTaZyTi. The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.
[20:10:08] <Quadpod88> too much coddling
[20:10:39] <Witchit> They don't want to criticize the kid too much
[20:10:48] <Quadpod88> "i'm so pissed, mom didn't get me the latest Iphone, she bought me the last gen"
[20:11:20] <Witchit> That's true, as well as the parents letting this happen
[20:11:30] <Witchit> That's what I'm trying to say :)
[20:11:33] <Quadpod88> i'm like "*&^%%$, you lucky you got a gift"
[20:12:10] <Witchit> Yeah...kids are REALLY spoiled nowadays
[20:12:27] <Witchit> I also just wish the parents wouldn't let the kid get away with it
[20:12:55] <Iona> Look at the parents:  the parents are taught "me me me me!"
[20:13:12] <Iona> guess what the kids have as an example?...
[20:13:32] <Quadpod88> i want to step in sometimes, so tempting to just pull off the belt and do the one thing that the parent doesn't have the spine to do
[20:13:48] <Witchit> Weeeeell I wouldn't want physical abuse either
[20:14:13] <Iona> Welts heal - bad attitudes don't.
[20:14:22] <Quadpod88> please, i got my butt wupped
[20:14:23] <Iona> Bad attitudes require a lifechanging event
[20:14:48] <Iona> Which is the lesser of two evils?
[20:14:50] <Witchit> Then do it psychologically. Teaching them physically causes fear
[20:15:01] <Witchit> Fear doesn't help
[20:15:09] <Iona> I agree.
[20:15:22] <Witchit> Sure it's an immediate solution, but that doesn't make it as good of a one :/
[20:15:30] <Iona> "Is this the outcome you want?"  versus "I'll cave into your demands"
[20:15:41] <Quadpod88> really, have you talked to the gen that got wuppins?
[20:15:42] <Iona> critical thinking...
[20:16:04] <Quadpod88> i'm pro belt
[20:16:07] <Witchit> Let's think of this a different way....
[20:16:22] <Quadpod88> ok
[20:16:29] <Witchit> If I were to beat you up if you bullied me
[20:16:41] <Iona> The thing is - physical punishment shouldn't be a substitute for a good example - a good example comes first...
[20:16:42] <Witchit> Would that be right?
[20:16:56] <Quadpod88> when to guys get into a fight, they respect each other
[20:17:00] <Iona> That way the kid knows what the desired behavior looks like
[20:17:00] <Quadpod88> after
[20:17:16] <Witchit> I doubt that
[20:17:18] <Iona> ...and when it doesn't happen, well, then there's other options...
[20:18:10] <Quadpod88> their are times, when respect must be taught phisically
[20:18:16] <Quadpod88> there
[20:18:38] <Quadpod88> sure, exhaust all other options
[20:18:50] <Quadpod88> then they need a bit of fear
[20:18:51] <Witchit> Quad, do you think that someone kicking you in the nuts for bullying really ends in friendship?
[20:18:55] <Witchit> I've been beaten up on multiple occassions, and it didn't end in holding hands and skipping in a field of flowers
[20:18:55] <Witchit> It ended in fear
[20:19:31] <Witchit> Fear won't help people understand....they need education so they understand
[20:19:36] <Quadpod88> you barking up the wrong tree, mest best friend broke my clavicle
[20:19:52] <Quadpod88> my best*
[20:20:21] <Witchit> I've honestly seen people fight out of fun, but they were friends and they were sparring
[20:20:32] <Witchit> Actual aggression can be really scary
[20:20:41] <Quadpod88> we weren't sparing
[20:20:57] <Quadpod88> of coarse it is
[20:21:05] <Quadpod88> it's supposed to be
[20:21:48] <Witchit> But it doesn't help educate, it doesn't really make the child go 'ohhh, that is morally right'
[20:21:57] <Witchit> They're just like 'OH MY GOD I'M DEAD'

[20:22:35] <Witchit> Hi Greenman :)
[20:22:52] <Quadpod88> it teaches that actions have (sometimes devestating) consequences
[20:23:24] <Quadpod88> morals aside, thats life
[20:23:57] <Iona> Cause and effect is important for a kid to understand...  things like "if I touch the stove, I get burnt" or "If I steal, I get caught"

[20:26:15] <Quadpod88> :(
[20:26:31] <Iona> Taking a hand in helping the kid to get caught if said kid steals...  is not immoral...  it is important for the learning proces.
[20:26:47] <Iona> It teaches social boundaries
[20:26:58] <Iona> ...and unreasonable demands is crossing a social boundary.
[20:27:27] <Quadpod88> i.e: drastic consequences
[20:27:50] <Quadpod88> here is the issue
[20:28:10] <Quadpod88> i got this but it takes aminute
[20:28:18] <Iona> it shouldn't be drastic

[20:28:24] <Abraxas> Welcome, ExTaZyTi. Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do... but how much love we put in that action.
[20:29:38] <Quadpod88> the issue is that kids are having kids, and they are still bitter for the consequences that the parents dealt out, so they let their kids run wild
[20:30:23] <Iona> part of it is also perspective...  
[20:30:43] <Iona> lots of people today are taught "spanking is bad!"
[20:31:01] <Iona> it's the extremes which should be educated about...  not a single kind of behavior...
[20:31:27] <Quadpod88> but it's a tool, don't get me wrong, i'm not advicting abuse
[20:31:36] <Iona> a better perspective would be "spank sparely and calmly, do not create fear"
[20:31:39] <Iona> yeah
[20:31:59] <Quadpod88> kids should have fear
[20:32:21] <Iona> ...it's those individuals which spank kids as a default coping mechanism which allows those laws to have root
[20:32:26] <Quadpod88> now, not so much that they are afraid to talk
[20:33:05] <Iona> mmmmm  fear of their own consequences - I don't advocate authority for authority's sake, therefore one must fear authority...  no...
[20:33:08] <Quadpod88> but they should be scared of the consequences of negative actions
[20:33:19] <Iona> i.e. the kid stealing getting caught again.
[20:33:26] <Iona> y3es.
[20:33:27] <Iona> *y3es
[20:33:29] <Iona> *yes

[20:38:47] <Iona> there's worse things - like scraped knees from playing outside.
[20:39:22] <Quadpod88> kids don't play outside anymore
