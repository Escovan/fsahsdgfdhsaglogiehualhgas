[01:29:21] <Love> 4üòÄ hi there Witchit, how are you.
[01:29:30] <Witchit> Hi Love! I'm good.
[01:29:31] <Keith> you should ask Hrafnbjorn... he is like an ancient rune master
[01:29:36] <Witchit> I actually did :D
[01:29:43] <Keith> good good :)
[01:29:43] <Witchit> I got a lot of good advice!
[01:29:53] <Keith> the man knows alot on the subject.
[01:30:20] <Witchit> He was very helpful, but I now have a question about Witches Runes
[01:30:25] <Witchit> Yaaaay XD
[01:30:35] <Hexe> What are witches runes?
[01:30:44] <Keith> witches have runes?
[01:31:14] <MissSugar> yeah
[01:31:15] <Witchit> Erm...as far as I know, they're like norse rune stones, except kinda not because they have crazier symbols
[01:31:20] <MissSugar> they are cool looking
[01:31:28] <Witchit> And I was wondering if they're okay to use
[01:31:34] <Keith> should i tattoo one on my forehead?
[01:31:34] <Witchit> Because they look easier
[01:31:36] <Hexe> Do you have some pictures?
[01:31:43] <Witchit> I can send some :)

[01:32:33] <Hexe> Those are not runes
[01:32:42] <Hexe> Those are symbols
[01:32:45] <Witchit> That's what they're called...
[01:32:50] <Witchit> Witches' Runes.
[01:32:59] <Hexe> Witches runes my arse
[01:33:05] <Keith> no clue
[01:33:08] <Witchit> I dunno :/
[01:33:16] <Keith> do you have meanings for them Witchit?
[01:33:29] <Witchit> They have meanings, I just haven't memorized them
[01:33:44] <Witchit> I wanted to come back to ask Hraf about them, but he's gone ^ ^"
[01:33:50] <Keith> well as long as they have a meaning(a purpose) i dont see why they cant be called runes
[01:33:59] <MissSugar> well they are
[01:34:05] <MissSugar> and have been for quite a long time
[01:34:11] <MissSugar> so maybe just let that one go
[01:34:33] <Witchit> MissSugar, you seem to know about them :) Are they a good idea for me to use?
[01:34:33] <Hexe> I doubt he has any good opinions about them because those "runes" have no conmection to scandinavian lore at all
[01:34:42] <Keith> lol i am saying i dont see why they cant be..
[01:35:07] <Keith> Hexe.. he isn't just about  scandanavian stuff.. that is more a specialization
[01:35:16] <Keith> to my knowledge
[01:35:25] <MissSugar> actually no i dont know about them, i remember seeing them when i was young and thinking that would be cool
[01:35:36] <Witchit> Oh, gotcha
[01:35:40] <Hexe> Im talking about those witches runes and not about bjorn
[01:36:18] <MissSugar> absolutely look into them, the symbols are unique 
[01:36:18] <Witchit> I just thought they may be easier to use because I'm more used to images than letters I am unaware of
[01:36:23] <Keith> i am saying hrafnbjorn may know stuff on more than just scandanavian runes.
[01:36:33] <Hexe> No doubt

[01:37:07] <Keith> howdy Chiaro
[01:37:21] <Witchit> I would, but they seem kind of messy to use ^ ^"

[01:38:14] <MissSugar> no more messy than any lots divination
[01:38:36] <Witchit> Well what do you mean by special items?
[01:38:45] <Witchit> I thought you meant actual bones XD
[01:39:08] <MissSugar> stones, bones, coins, tiny statues, etc
[01:39:11] <MissSugar> shells
[01:39:23] <Witchit> Ohhh, and you make your own meaning?
[01:39:26] <MissSugar> yeah
[01:39:39] <Witchit> That sounds a bit harder for me...I could try it though
[01:39:44] <MissSugar> beads
[01:40:24] <Witchit> Beads definitely work
[01:40:32] <Witchit> That actually might be kind of fun...
[01:41:32] <Witchit> So the method is called bone reading?
[01:41:45] <Hexe> Im getting old and antiquated im not up to date anymore with all the modern esoteric stuff
[01:42:03] <MissSugar> there are many types of bone divinations that is just one of them
[01:42:38] * Hexe goes back to the pot of beans
[01:42:59] <Witchit> I think I'll try the bone one.....it sounds better than trying to understand runes I don't have experience with

[01:55:17] <Witchit> I was thinking about this punk style where I would shave half my head, but I know I'm not ready yet to take care of that style
[01:55:39] <Keith> why not shave the sides of your head?

[04:03:20] <Natashka> oh honey that's what hair dye is for
[04:03:56] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Nope, I won't do that. I'm actually glad to have reached this age, and still be breathing.
[04:04:02] <Natashka> Archer I'm doing markets atm that link is my stuff
[04:04:36] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Plus, I have 2 ex-wives and I raised 2 daughters. I EARNED thes gray hairs, fair and square.

[04:09:09] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, me
[04:09:22] <Natashka> Of course
[04:09:48] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Haven't seen Kat in a long time, but I see her on FB once in a while
[04:10:12] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Occasionally, Aradia pops in, but doesn't stay long
[04:10:27] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Willow is busy elsewhere
[04:10:46] <Natashka> I haven't spoken to Kat in ages.
[04:11:32] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yes

[05:00:37] <MissSugar> LOL
[05:00:46] <MissSugar> they are going to be good

[05:01:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I've stopped, for now.
[05:02:20] <MissSugar> well thats good
[05:03:08] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Gotta add a new rule to the list:  NO Food Talk!
[05:03:13] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> hehehe
[05:04:00] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Damn, can't do that, as herbs can BE food, and kitchen magick involves cooking
[05:06:57] <MissSugar> but then i cant make everyone jealous 
[05:07:01] <MissSugar> with my food stuff
[05:09:23] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ;)
[05:09:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Nevermind, the others won't let me do that, anyway.
[05:10:07] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> They all like food too much.  ;)
[05:11:05] <MissSugar> its all about the food
[05:11:05] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Have you prepared for tomorrow?
[05:11:15] <MissSugar> whats tomorrow?
[05:11:30] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Our old 'friend' Mercury goes retrograde.
[05:11:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Until May 22nd.
[05:12:00] <MissSugar> oh god as if i didnt have enough problems
[05:12:25] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That will make 5 planets in retrograde at once.
[05:12:38] <MissSugar> jebus
[05:13:02] <MissSugar> people are going to be crazy
[05:13:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto
[05:13:28] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> They already are. But some will be even crazier.

[05:18:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> that's the word, "amusing", yup

[05:19:12] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Let's hope there is not a repeat of that.
[05:19:19] <MissSugar> yes that was not amusing
[05:19:37] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I know a couple people here who think your video lessons are a great idea.
[05:20:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And I mean here in my town, not just here in the room.
[05:20:27] <The-Keith> i enjoy them.... you learn lots
[05:20:34] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> They may not have an interest in chat, but the think the videos are a cool thing
[05:21:50] <MissSugar> well i appreciate that
[05:21:57] <The-Keith> MissSugar, do you have a title within your religion?
[05:22:04] <MissSugar> Bokor
[05:22:15] <The-Keith> is that like Priestess?
[05:22:53] <MissSugar> no
[05:23:15] <MissSugar> it basically means sorcerer 
[05:23:20] <The-Keith> ohhhh
[05:23:41] <The-Keith> cool beans
[05:24:42] <MissSugar> i am not an initiate 
[05:25:04] <The-Keith> would you be near the top of your totem pole, so to speak
[05:25:43] <MissSugar> nope
[05:26:00] <Quadpod88> i'm freelance
[05:26:18] <MissSugar> Mambo or Hougan Asogwe are at the top
[05:26:57] <The-Keith> So if i were to introduce you to someone... would I say something similar to "this is Bokor MissSugar, Voodoo practioner"?
[05:27:11] <The-Keith> so am I Quadpod88
[05:27:31] <MissSugar> yeah that would be accurate
[05:28:16] * The-Keith makes a not of that.
[05:28:18] <The-Keith> note
[05:29:00] <The-Keith> Thinking of a video to try and put you out there on the interwebs
[05:30:19] <MissSugar> LOL lets not and say we did
[05:30:41] <The-Keith> DEAL!!!!.... and no take-backsies
[05:31:06] <MissSugar> so we are totally not doing that
[05:31:16] * Quadpod88 looks up from hitting post on MissSugar "oops"
[05:31:17] <The-Keith> ......wait, what??
[05:31:37] <The-Keith> how about.....
[05:32:34] <The-Keith> dont worry I won't MissSugar
[05:32:44] <MissSugar> thank you
[05:32:53] <The-Keith> of course :)
[05:32:57] <MissSugar> i would rather be relatively unknown

[05:33:52] <MissSugar> noooooo
[05:33:55] <MissSugar> dont do that
[05:34:15] <The-Keith> well I will do a video of Quadpod88 doing the massive pr stunt
[05:34:17] <Quadpod88> it's so done
[05:34:26] <Quadpod88> yes!!!
[05:34:28] <Quadpod88> win
[05:34:29] <The-Keith> as not to break my word
[05:34:46] <Quadpod88> i made no such promise
[05:35:07] <The-Keith> but i said i wouldn't do a video on her... so I will do a video on you and your practices :)
[05:35:25] * The-Keith hides under a beanbag chair
[05:35:43] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I try to downplay praise in my own community, as I don't want my own head getting too big. I'd rather stay an Ordinary Man than become Somebody Important.
[05:35:44] <Quadpod88> hmm
[05:36:00] <MissSugar> i would just rather stay away from people who try to tear other people down
[05:36:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And, if it can't be avoided, I try not to believe my own press.
[05:36:30] <The-Keith> i can understand both of your points of view.  being famous would be an annoying pain in the butt
[05:36:52] <MissSugar> you get too well known and all of a sudden your getting hate mail for no reason
[05:37:16] <The-Keith> yup
[05:37:26] <The-Keith> you're right on that
[05:37:28] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That's  what got Billy The KId into trouble. He and his cronies started out legally serving warrants, and Billy started believing his own press, and thought himself above the Law.
[05:37:42] <Quadpod88> or, just awesome stalkers
[05:38:03] <Quadpod88> i mean, the skill on some of these guys
[05:38:06] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That, too, MissSugar. You become a "name" in your community, you become a target.

[05:38:57] <MissSugar> LOL all for writing a couple of books and doing some vidoes
[05:39:24] <Keith> but then you have book signings, and interviews, and conventions.
[05:39:36] <Keith> meetings at the super market
[05:39:37] <MissSugar> i had a taste of it on tumblr when i got up to a thousand followers, while i was doing my voodoo thing on there helping people out and i got at least 5 hate messages a day
[05:40:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Not good
[05:40:18] <Quadpod88> love hateful ppl
[05:40:38] <Quadpod88> they always give me a good laugh
[05:41:14] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> They give me indigestion.
[05:41:36] <Quadpod88> i'm having problems with a hateful person now
[05:41:59] <Keith> how is it a problem if you love it
[05:42:06] <Quadpod88> he thinks he scares me because he was incarcerated
[05:42:08] <MissSugar> yeah well eventually i broke down and deleted the whole thing
[05:42:21] <Quadpod88> it's funny
[05:42:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> A shame, that is, MissSugar
[05:42:35] <Quadpod88> but i think he might try something
[05:42:42] <Keith> so much work, gone to the pyre
[05:42:50] <MissSugar> and the thing was i felt that i owed every single person an explanation that was what got me in the end
[05:43:18] <Keith> ohhhhh... bad way to look at things
[05:43:20] <Quadpod88> oi
[05:43:24] <Keith> poor girl
[05:43:31] <Quadpod88> you owe nothing
[05:43:33] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> You never owe anyone an explanation

[05:45:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> MissSugar, are you familiar with Rudyard Kipling's poem, "If" ??
[05:47:20] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> He wrote it for his son. When I read it to mydaughters, I amended the last line to read, "You'll be full grown, my little one", rather than "You'll be a man, my son." The poem itself has some powerful Life Lessons.
[05:47:54] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It's my favorite poem
[05:49:44] <MissSugar> i actually havent read that poem
[05:50:14] <Quadpod88> i have
[05:50:24] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I recommend it
[05:50:24] <MissSugar> well now i have
[05:50:45] <MissSugar> its a good little poem
[05:50:49] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I believe that it says a lot

[06:36:59] <June> Sir Archer, u heard about the trial outcome of our liverpool football fans?
[06:47:33] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I did not, Lady June. The news I've seen from BPL is all concentrating on Leicester, and the amazing season they've had.
[06:48:06] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> They can clinch this Sunday.
[06:48:22] <June> ahh... well its about a 27 yr old case
[06:48:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> If they win Sunday, it won't matter what Tottenham does on Monday.
[06:48:53] <June> in 1984 i think it was, 97 fans were killed when the stadium collapsed
[06:48:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Wow, what has been dragging on for 27 years?

[06:49:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Oh, I do recall hearing of a stadium collapse some time back, We didn't hear the outcome over here.
[06:49:46] <June> but it was actually due to police and unsafe practices
[06:50:04] <June> yeah cos there was no outcome, pure cover ups
[06:50:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I recall that, yes. Trying to blame the victims. Despicable, to my mind.
[06:50:24] <June> yes!
[06:50:58] <June> apparently, at this jury trial... so many lies were uncovered that there is a big hush on what happened in court
[06:51:04] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It would have been like blaming Anraham Lincoln for getting shot bt John Wilkes Booth, over here.
[06:51:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Abraham
[06:51:23] <June> cos they do not want to jeaopardise any other trial in the matter
[06:51:36] <June> exactly Sir Archer
[06:51:37] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Good grief
[06:51:46] <Quadpod88> but it was abe's fault
[06:51:56] <June> to my mind they were saying it was a mass suicide!
[06:51:57] <Quadpod88> jk
[06:52:18] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Hey, Parlaiment! It's YOUR fault that Guy Fawkes tried to blow you up!
[06:52:41] <Quadpod88> that probly was
[06:52:42] <June> there is talk that the south yorkshire police may even be disbanded the corruption went so far and was so bad
[06:53:18] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> So, they'll need to replace the entire police force in South Yorkshire?
[06:53:25] <June> yes!
[06:53:32] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Wow!
[06:53:39] <June> s yorkshire police have a very bad name as it is
[06:53:46] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ah
[06:54:05] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Not as honorable as the Yard, then?
[06:54:31] <June> there has been similarities to stuff they did at the miners strike a short time before the liverpool football disaster
[06:54:49] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> omigosh!
[06:54:50] <June> http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-deadly-mistakes-and-lies-that-lasted-decades
[06:56:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That bloke should get the gallows
[06:57:43] <June> i tell you ppl must be loosing teeth gnashing on the lies they told
[06:57:47] <Quadpod88> yay!!! gallows
[06:58:39] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> may well be, June
[06:58:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> They deserve to lose teeth, at the very least.
[06:59:11] <June> so it has been given approval for the victims families to go after the individuals
[06:59:14] <Quadpod88> missing teeth isn't funny
[06:59:20] <June> no matter what position they hold
[06:59:43] <June> and so it should be, hold them to account
[07:00:14] <Quadpod88> or the contractors that last inspected the building
[07:00:49] <June> individuals
[07:02:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Was this on Liverpool's Home pitch?
[07:03:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Or Sherwood's?
[07:03:40] <June> liverpool's
[07:03:40] <Quadpod88> pitch?
[07:03:50] <Quadpod88> i thought it was football
[07:04:35] <June> we english have a terrible history with liverpudlians
[07:04:49] <June> we do not respect them hence why they were treated so badly
[07:04:54] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It IS football, Quadpod88. Here in the States, we call it soccer.
[07:05:17] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Everywhere else in the world, it's football, including at the Olympics
[07:05:21] <Quadpod88> yeah, and i only know of a pitch in baseball
[07:05:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> In England, the call the field of play "the pitch"
[07:05:56] * Quadpod88 doesn't watch alot of soccer
[07:06:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I watch it a lot, on NBCSN
[07:06:25] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I love the game
[07:06:30] <Quadpod88> i already figured it was soccer
[07:06:35] <June> i'm a liverpool fan, cos b/f is lol
[07:07:06] <Quadpod88> does wales or scotland have a team?
[07:07:57] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I don't have a particular side, june. But, this year has been w=exciting, watching Leicester defy the odds set down by the bookmakers, and all the pundits who said at the beginning of the season they couldn't maintain their spot at the top of the table.
[07:08:03] <June> yep
[07:08:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Shocking to see how Chelsea collapsed from last season, and Aston Villa getting relegated.
[07:09:10] <June> i can't stand chelsea
[07:09:37] <June> or Man U
[07:09:44] * Quadpod88 stares blankly trying to figure out the conversation
[07:10:04] <Quadpod88> is that what i sound like talking american football
[07:10:04] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> A lot can't. I talked to some in another room that were openly joyful that Chelsea fell off as they did.
[07:10:22] <June> chelsea too arogant
[07:10:40] <June> arrogant... spelling lol
[07:10:44] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, they got a lesson in humility this year, it seems
[07:10:57] <June> yeah glad for that
[07:11:06] <Quadpod88> so, i hate the broncos more since last season
[07:11:36] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I've never been a Broncos fan, Quadpod88
[07:11:44] <Quadpod88> not as much as the panthers not bringing their a-game
[07:11:53] <Quadpod88> bastards
[07:12:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Packers all the way, since the days when Vince was coaching them
[07:12:07] <Quadpod88> i'm a huge texans fan
[07:12:32] <Quadpod88> though i miss the days of earl campbell
[07:13:18] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> hmmm
[07:13:41] <Quadpod88> from the oilers
[07:13:50] <Quadpod88> now known as the titans
[07:14:01] <Quadpod88> after they got sold from houston
[07:14:34] <Quadpod88> again, bastards

[07:20:30] <Quadpod88> you'd be surprised
[07:20:57] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> They are not as beloved as they believe themselves to be
[07:21:31] <Quadpod88> according to this weird stat, broncos have the widest fan base

[07:49:36] <AntleredGirl> I got my tax refund and bought us a new tent, a twin burner propane camping stove (really small, nice and portable) and some other goodies, like a new tarp and such
[07:50:05] <AntleredGirl> and I made certain that my camp kitchen is prepared. I'm conjuring up an entire menu for the whole trip. I am...slightly obsessing.

[19:44:55] <Witchit> Ello :)
[19:46:42] <North> ahoy, Witchit
[19:46:55] <Witchit> Hey North!
[19:47:03] <North> how's the day in Gidgetville?
[19:47:34] <Witchit> Pretty tiring, but good! I recently bought a mother's day gift for mom, so I'm excited to show her
[19:47:40] <Witchit> (on mother's day)
[19:47:47] <North> excellent
[19:48:02] <Witchit> I also bought Witches' Runes because I want to expand my horizon of divination
[19:48:14] <North> ah yes, you were saying
[19:48:36] <North> Hraf may be helpful in untangling some of that
[19:48:49] <Witchit> I actually got a lot of information from him :)
[19:48:53] <Witchit> He's so awesome
[19:48:59] <North> cool
[19:49:19] <Witchit> And he immediately ranted about it and I loved it XD
[19:49:24] <North> lol
[19:49:32] <Witchit> I love it when people rant
[19:49:36] <North> knows his stuff
[19:49:44] <Witchit> I especially rant myself, but he knows a LOT
[19:50:00] <Witchit> Like, he knows almost EVERYTHING
[19:50:06] <North> your rants often have the added benefit of being amusing
[19:50:27] <Witchit> Eheheh ^ ^" I tend to go overboard....but thank you
[19:50:34] <North> :)
[19:50:58] <Witchit> I hate just talking about the weather, and would rather rant about things that aren't boring and common
[19:51:30] <North> unless it happens to be something like, oh, say...basketball-sized hail
[19:51:30] <Witchit> But sometimes people don't understand what I'm saying because uncommon things can be a curse :P
[19:51:51] <Witchit> Until winter comes, I don't think that'll be an issue :P

[19:52:20] <Witchit> Hi Raggiedmon!
[19:52:43] <Raggiedmon> Ello
[19:53:03] <Witchit> But yeah, I love ranting about video games the most....although that sometimes gets me in trouble because no one likes hearing my character studies XD
[19:53:32] <North> roll of the dice
[19:53:53] <North> never know what'll float someone's boat
[19:53:57] <Witchit> Yeah, it's kind of tricky handling a conversation
[19:54:16] <North> exacerbated, at times, by this medium
[19:55:00] <Witchit> Yeah, especially when you're a geek in a town of ungeeks.
[19:55:13] * North commiserates
[19:55:21] <North> we muddle through, I suppose
[19:56:02] <Witchit> I also like talking about psychology and how it relates to magic
[19:56:10] <Witchit> Which of course gets people pissed
[19:56:33] <Witchit> I never like getting people angry, but sometimes that's what happens
[19:56:51] <North> so it goes
[19:57:12] <Witchit> Indeed. It sucks that my town is so close-minded
[19:57:45] <Witchit> I hope that no one has to live in a town with uptight snootles :P
[19:57:55] <North> snootles lol
[19:58:03] <H-> pschology+magick gets people pissed ?
[19:58:39] <Witchit> Yeah...my town is made up of christians and jews, so witches kind of get a bad rep there...

[20:01:53] <Witchit> *Hi
[20:02:42] <Witchit> But yeah, not all Jews and Christians are evil or anything, I just wish that they weren't so prejudice in my case :/
[20:02:55] <North> takes its toll, I wager
[20:03:25] <Witchit> No one should really hide their religion, but unfortunately that's what I used to do
[20:03:58] <North> unexpressed feelings: not conducive to good mental health
[20:04:19] * North tenuously relates
[20:04:34] <Witchit> You had to hide your religion too? :(
