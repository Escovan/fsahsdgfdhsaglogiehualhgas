[00:07:22] <Guest19088> you did a really nice job

[00:09:05] <Abraxas> nothing nothing
[00:09:24] <Hrafnbjorn> I like doing the spiraling... the angles were tough to get as symetrical as I could, but still not very good
[00:09:37] <SpiritSong> they are good
[00:09:47] <SpiritSong> and besides, its your first one
[00:11:09] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[00:11:42] <SpiritSong> i think its awesome
[00:11:49] <SpiritSong> and im fussy :P
[00:12:48] <Hrafnbjorn> Im gonna braid a hemp cord for it later, for now I need to rest the eyes from focusing on small stuff, lol
[00:14:25] <Hrafnbjorn> hows your day been SpiritSong?
[00:19:23] <SpiritSong> sorry back...i was disengaging myself from the bed that i passed out on...i sat down on it to knit, woke up with a needle threathening my nostrol
[00:19:28] <SpiritSong> nostril
[00:19:42] <SpiritSong> is the hemp cord easy ti get there?
[00:20:56] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah its pretty easy
[00:22:04] <SpiritSong> are you carving a symbol in that one?
[00:22:59] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, as soon as I figure out what to carve
[00:23:27] <SpiritSong> :P
[00:24:15] <Hrafnbjorn> I have been trying to think of a rune that would fit with the type of stone (snowflake obsidian)
[00:24:45] <SpiritSong> oh so to match the magic correspondence of the stone?
[00:25:12] <Hrafnbjorn> I originaly thought of the bjarkan/berkano rune, which is a goddess related one, but to me that is a 'green' related one
[00:25:27] <Hrafnbjorn> either magic correspondence, or color, or something
[00:26:13] <SpiritSong> the goddess often has a blue candle on a wiccan altar, so it could work
[00:26:20] <Hrafnbjorn> it (the stone) has an Odian feel, so I may use either ansuz, or ass
[00:26:38] <SpiritSong> oh wait its not blue
[00:26:39] <SpiritSong> darp
[00:26:53] <Hrafnbjorn> those runes would symbolize wisdom exchange, as well as verbal communication, and inspiration
[00:27:39] <SpiritSong> and what does snowflake obsidian correspond to
[00:27:53] <Hrafnbjorn> not sure
[00:27:53] <Iona> Hrafnbjorn: you may be looking for a combination of runes which evoke the Norns.
[00:28:09] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, that may be good idea...

[01:00:49] <OddlyGentle> wish I would have known him personally.
[01:01:26] <OddlyGentle> So technically not a mentor but I do not think of anyone as an idol
[01:05:39] <SpiritSong> i haven't heard of him, ill admit
[01:05:49] <SpiritSong> a role model?
[01:06:01] <OddlyGentle> That's the word!!
[01:06:08] <OddlyGentle> or words rather
[01:06:31] <SpiritSong> :P

[01:15:05] <Abraxas> Welcome, MissSugar. Ultimately though it is up to each individual to decide how they wish to perceive reality.  Which is how it should be.
[01:15:20] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa MissSugar!
[01:15:27] <OddlyGentle> so were Jesus, Buddha, and Gandhi.
[01:15:27] <MissSugar> hey Hrafnbjorn 
[01:15:48] <OddlyGentle> all these became Messiah
[01:16:26] <Hrafnbjorn> Shaka, or Sidhartha, not Buddha
[01:17:10] <Hrafnbjorn> while Shaka Buddha was a liberator, the next Buddha will not be a liberator, or savious she will be a redemer
[01:17:11] <OddlyGentle> Messiah is a state of mind rather than a separate being..... like Satan!
[01:18:38] <Hrafnbjorn> my only point is that "Buddha" isnt a being
[01:18:55] <OddlyGentle> in point of fact, Palmer was a Satan long before he was Messiah.
[01:19:11] <OddlyGentle> a Messiah ***
[01:19:29] <Iona> Hraf, what is your source for the next Buddha not being a liberator?
[01:19:44] <Hrafnbjorn> Three-Fold Lotus Sutra
[01:20:07] <Iona> I'll look it up
[01:20:17] <OddlyGentle> And you DO know a redemption is a type of liberation right?
[01:20:20] <Hrafnbjorn> it says Matreya, the next Buddha will be the world redeemer. amd will have different message from Shaka Buddha
[01:20:45] <Hrafnbjorn> she doesnt redeem the individual, she redeems the world
[01:21:13] <Hrafnbjorn> I suppose she may fit the messiah definition as a leader of people though
[01:21:26] <OddlyGentle> redemption refers to the release or setting free of prisoners or slaves
[01:21:38] <Hrafnbjorn> nope
[01:21:40] * Iona thinks...
[01:22:17] <SpiritSong> MissSugar <3
[01:22:18] <Iona> OddlyGentle: setting free a slave can be cruelty. That's imposition of values...
[01:22:26] <MissSugar> SpiritSong, 
[01:22:28] <MissSugar> <3
[01:22:31] <SpiritSong> :)
[01:22:33] <Iona> I do agree that freedom matters.
[01:22:36] <SpiritSong> how are you?
[01:22:38] <Hrafnbjorn> it means, in this case, to reveal the illusion to all, and to redeem those illusions... first Buddha revealed illusion within the self, next one reveals its correlation to the outer illusion, and reconciles the 2
[01:22:45] <MissSugar> i cant complain
[01:22:47] <MissSugar> hows you
[01:22:54] <SpiritSong> im fine:)

[01:26:31] <Iona> OddlyGentle: are you responding to me?
[01:26:56] <OddlyGentle> it clearly indicates redemption as a form of salvation
[01:27:04] <Hrafnbjorn> no, Iona, hes jjuts  fitting cause he didnt like which part of the definition is spoken of in Lotus Sutra
[01:27:09] <Mim> webster's dictionary only knows what it's culture tells it to know, actually
[01:27:18] <Hrafnbjorn> it can be yes, just not in this case
[01:27:27] <Mim> is muddaskunt in there?
[01:27:41] <Mim> I rest my case
[01:27:46] <Hrafnbjorn> there is no such thing as salvation in any buddhism though, that is almost purely an Abrahamic concept
[01:28:15] <OddlyGentle> No...... salvation is rescue or liberation
[01:28:25] <Iona> Buddhism does "freedom" via the 8fold path
[01:28:25] <Hrafnbjorn> in the case of the next buddha it clearly states which aspect of 'redeemer' it uses, so all those other definitions are irrelivent
[01:28:55] <OddlyGentle> it is NOT an Abrahamic concept that one in bondage or oppression can be liberated
[01:29:24] <SpiritSong> salvation is chocolate
[01:29:29] <Hrafnbjorn> oh geez, nevermind, you clearly are only interested in what you are saying, so I wont waste my time
[01:29:30] <OddlyGentle> that is actually a very old concept going as far back as slavery itself

[01:42:37] <BansheeTears> But not sure yet
[01:42:45] <Hrafnbjorn> BansheeTears, I finished another wirewrap, but I didnt do the pentacle one, same technique just more 'points'

[01:43:12] <BansheeTears> Thanks  Iona  :)
[01:43:18] <BansheeTears> Wow!!
[01:43:45] <BansheeTears> That came out lovely
[01:44:08] <Mim> ooo snowflake obsidian!
[01:44:15] <Mim> very beautiful wreath, widds!
[01:44:23] <BansheeTears> Thankies
[01:45:17] <SpiritSong> its looking awesome Hrafnbjorn ^_^
[01:45:29] <BansheeTears> Do you wrap more than one length?
[01:45:44] <Iona> That's a great job Hraf!
[01:45:44] <BansheeTears> I usually work with 4
[01:45:54] <Hrafnbjorn> thanks :)
[01:46:09] <SpiritSong> yours look like all one piece. nice and smooth
[01:46:10] <Keith> not bad at all Hrafnbjorn :)  keep up the good work
[01:47:01] <Hrafnbjorn> only my second attempt, so I am happy
[01:47:07] <BansheeTears> I got a square labradorite you can have for practice too
[01:47:27] <BansheeTears> Damn thin has the purest blue flash I ever seen
[01:47:36] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, BansheeTears, its 3 lengths, pluss the pieces that wrap and bind the 3 together
[01:47:51] <BansheeTears> Sweet!!!
[01:48:26] <SpiritSong> :)
[01:49:11] <BansheeTears> Painters tape is a easy way to hold them in line while. You do the bind wrapping
[01:49:33] <BansheeTears> No residue
[01:50:48] <Iona> Painter's tape is awesome
[01:50:51] <SpiritSong> oh that masking tape?
[01:50:52] <BansheeTears> We so crafty :p
[01:50:58] <BansheeTears> It's blue
[01:51:00] <Iona> Its the blue tape
[01:51:04] <SpiritSong> never seen it before
[01:51:06] <BansheeTears> Comes off easy too
[01:51:40] * SpiritSong googles it
[01:51:46] <BansheeTears> Holds them in line like a vice while you wrap
[01:52:22] <SpiritSong> seems like it would be super hard without it
[01:52:23] <Hrafnbjorn> I will have to try that
[01:53:19] <Hrafnbjorn> hah, just need 3 hands, and its easy ;)
[01:53:24] <SpiritSong> id like to try wire wrap,,,but as sort of accent pieces on my clay...like a clay owl with silver pentacles embedded
[01:53:36] <BansheeTears> Then take off all the tape and at the top, flip a few backwards over the back and use another length to wrap the top
[01:54:42] <SpiritSong> :)
[01:54:43] <BansheeTears> Always feel like I need more hands and glasses

[04:15:19] <StormWatcher> I'm not mad at least that's what the voices in my head tell me 
[04:15:31] <Zool> Hrafnbjorn they aren't eels
[04:15:33] <Mim> We're all here becuse we're not all there
[04:15:42] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yes, Hrafnbjorn, the lamprey is a type of eel. Or so I was told in High School.
[04:15:50] <Hrafnbjorn> ok, I wasnt sure
[04:16:05] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That, too, Mim.
[04:16:07] <Hrafnbjorn> whatever they are, they are creepy

[04:17:16] <StormWatcher> Amen to that

[04:23:13] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I'm ok with it, as my friend doesn't stay awake at night, wishing he'd got it out whilst he could.
[04:23:43] <CantSirDraggin> not in a minivan you won't
[04:23:44] <StormWatcher> He even has a sign on his van saying free tornados 
[04:23:45] <Zool> CSD always gets it out, but it depends on what "it" we are talking about..
[04:23:51] <StormWatcher> YOU PUT THE SIGN ON IT!
[04:24:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Better than the sign he used to have.
[04:24:43] <CantSirDraggin> mcm made that up, never had that sign on it
[04:24:57] <CantSirDraggin> middle seats are still out though
[04:25:01] <StormWatcher> You sent me the picture 
[04:25:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> But, "We have come for your daughters"  got him shot at too many times,so he replaced it.

[04:42:31] <Mim> Hraf, are you here?
[04:42:38] <Hrafnbjorn> yep :)
[04:42:48] <Mim> Do you cast runes still?
[04:43:15] <Hrafnbjorn> Ive never real cast runes for divination, why?
[04:43:42] <Mim> I don't use them for divination, but I like to use them in spell work
[04:43:53] <Hrafnbjorn> ya cant study runes without studying it though... even if it isnt traditional, it is part of modern runology
[04:44:16] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, spell work is better use for them IMO
[04:44:44] <Mim> ah, thank you! I was going to ask what you thought about it...
[04:45:10] <Hrafnbjorn> I think there are some cross roads between rune magic, and seidhr that can be pseudo-divination as well
[04:45:12] <Mim> I only know the meaningings...I don't know the lore and the "rules" 
[04:45:30] <Mim> that is interesting
[04:45:46] <Hrafnbjorn> I had posted some of the lore on the website before it crashed
[04:46:02] <Mim> which one
[04:46:12] <Mim> doesn't matter, I guess
[04:46:14] <Hrafnbjorn> alternatefaiths
[04:46:17] <Mim> ah ok 
[04:47:11] <Hrafnbjorn> there is only lore for the younger row, and he Saxon row though, the elder row, which is what most books are about, has no lore... all we know is the stave shapes, the stave order, and assumption for phonetic value
[04:48:16] <Mim> that b/c it's too old?
[04:48:39] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, most likely
[04:49:24] <Hrafnbjorn> when they write the books that focus on them, they cross compare the lore for the younger and saxon rows to make educated guess
[04:51:39] <Hrafnbjorn> the younger row has by far the most lore, because there are sections of several sagags that speak dirctly about them, plus there is a specific type of verse, called 'galdraslag' or "magic meter" that carries runic meaning... and the galdraslag is common in most of the sogur
[04:52:08] <Hrafnbjorn> sagags=sagas sorry
[04:52:27] <StormWatcher> What did I miss 
[04:52:30] <Mim> I find it all kind of confusing
[04:53:11] <Hrafnbjorn> where do you feel confused?
[04:53:52] <Mim> mostly runes are younger row? 
[04:53:58] <Mim> I mean, the ones you can buy
[04:54:12] <Hrafnbjorn> most are elder row... the 24 stve one
[04:54:15] <Hrafnbjorn> *stave
[04:54:20] <Mim> oooh oh oh ok 
[04:54:28] <Hrafnbjorn> but most of the lore is for the younger
[04:55:18] <Hrafnbjorn> the younger, even though technicaly more evolved, are harder linguisticaly, so perhaps thats another reason the elder is more popular
[04:55:40] <Mim> oh ok 
[04:55:53] <Hrafnbjorn> or could just be the feeling that older is better or more pure etc
[04:57:37] <Mim> I'd go with easier! :P 
[04:57:47] <Hrafnbjorn> the Saxon side has a good amount of lore too, and they are popular among the Theodish Heathens... and they are easier than the younger, but lot more staves.  The Saxon row also includes some Christian stuff in the lore
[04:58:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Mim, are you suggesting that Old Men are "easy"???
[04:58:14] <Hrafnbjorn> the Saxon row varied between 32 and 34 staves
[04:58:31] <Mim> "easier" Archie, easier 
[04:58:32] <Mim> ;)

[05:00:15] <Mim> I have a ring that has ogham script on it from Ireland (one of my relatives gave it to me) 
[05:00:34] <Mim> it's supposed to read "faith" 
[05:00:39] <Hrafnbjorn> We lost a lot of the lore that would be related to the trees that the ogham symbolized thanks to Roman's unfortunatly
[05:00:48] * Mim nods
[05:01:16] <Mim> pesky romans! 
[05:01:29] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yeah, the Romans wee a problem even before they became Holy.
[05:01:33] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> were
[05:01:49] <Hrafnbjorn> in Celtic Gaelic or Irish Gaelic?
[05:01:56] <Mim> I'm pretty sure my family line is a product of the roman invasion
[05:02:07] <StormWatcher> They are the same 
[05:02:11] <Hrafnbjorn> Celtic Gaelic for faith is feri-en-sta-
[05:02:24] <Hrafnbjorn> no they arent the same
[05:02:27] <Mim> well, it's the ogham...the sticks? 
[05:02:34] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah
[05:03:09] <Mim> I thought it was all Celtic
[05:03:50] <Hrafnbjorn> no, the word gaelic is Celtic, but it was aplied later when folk were mistaking Kelltic for Celtic
[05:05:19] <Hrafnbjorn> there certainly were Celts pushed up into the isles, but a very low minority, more in England than Ireland, but both did get some pushed up by Romans
[05:05:29] <Mim> http://nuacht1.com/ogham/   
[05:05:34] <Zool> gaelic comes from old irish, scottish gaelic also originated in ireland.. ie celtic..
[05:05:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Ooh, I saw a great joke on FB. A meme tht was a pic of Liam Neeson as Rob Roy, with a caption reading: "You know why it's called a kilt? Because we kilt everyone who called it a skirt".
[05:05:52] <MissSugar> LOL i like that
[05:06:04] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> hehehe  me, too.  ;)
[05:06:05] <Mim> the ring has script like what is on the link
[05:06:50] <Hrafnbjorn> the term predates Old Irish, and was used as far east as modern Iran
[05:07:43] <Mim> I always thought it was like connected to the way the druids may have done divination
[05:08:01] <Mim> sorry I used like as an adverb

[05:10:03] <Mim> around 6am
[05:10:06] <Hrafnbjorn> no, you said ya were gonna try
[05:10:17] <Mim> he knocked a bunch of stuff over on my night table
[05:10:34] <Hrafnbjorn> I loves frogs
[05:10:36] <Mim> and my kitty was like "oooo a toy!" 
[05:10:41] <Mim> so I had to get him
[05:10:57] <Mim> he was covered in dust bunnies (should clean under my bed, I guess) 
[05:11:02] <Mim> and was unsticky
[05:11:07] <Mim> couldn't get away from kitty 
[05:11:28] <Mim> hope he/she is ok now
[05:11:29] <Hrafnbjorn> my katana is frog motif.. or did I already tell you that?
[05:11:38] <Mim> you did, but what'a katana
[05:11:43] <Mim> I meant to ask last night
[05:11:51] <Hrafnbjorn> of one of the Japanese swords
[05:12:00] <Mim> oooooh cool
[05:12:17] <Mim> I feel like that was the name of a Mortal Combat charachter
[05:12:27] <Mim> charcter*
[05:12:43] <Hrafnbjorn> katana actualy refers to the type of scabbard, but most just call all the Japanese longswords katana

[05:13:49] <Mim> wooow
[05:13:52] <Mim> is that yours?

[05:19:58] <Hrafnbjorn> anyone have topic idea?
[05:20:48] <MissSugar> i dont know if i am cool with gnostic vodoun
[05:20:55] <Zool> how many super heroes actually have day jobs? lol
[05:21:28] <MissSugar> i keep thinking that i must be stupid not knowing really the depth of it, but then to discover that they are saying vodoun comes from atlantis and some bs like that is really disturbing
[05:21:42] <Hrafnbjorn> seems to me, from what little I know of vodoun that its not entirely wise to always have a gnostic outlook, or motivation
[05:22:21] <MissSugar> yeah i read some stuff and researched it for a couple of days and i was like "this doesnt make me feel comfortable"
[05:22:37] <Hrafnbjorn> interesting, I never knoew atlantis had anything to do with it
[05:22:44] <MissSugar> it doesnt
[05:22:52] <Hrafnbjorn> *knew
[05:23:24] <MissSugar> they are saying that like its always been around, that it predates haiti like they are trying to erase that islands history 
[05:23:30] <Hrafnbjorn> what type of gnosis do they seek?
[05:23:59] <MissSugar> they are seeking to traverse dimensions with the Lwa
[05:24:10] <Hrafnbjorn> I see
[05:24:42] <MissSugar> not that i dont believe that you could do something like that, its just their ideas that make me uncomfortable
[05:25:21] <MissSugar> its also hyper sexualized, which is not a part of traditional vodoun at all
[05:25:32] <MissSugar> and that also makes me uncomfortable
[05:26:07] <Hrafnbjorn> I couldnt judge it since similar things are done in seidh arts, however I would think that if you go into it with wrong ideas like the atlantis thing, you will get more friction and resistance than help form spirits... some might even take that as an easy target for manipulation
[05:26:56] <MissSugar> i agree
[05:27:28] <MissSugar> i know that some people have had great sucess with it, but i find it morally repugnant, which is odd feeling for me since for the most part i am very neutral
[05:27:49] * SpiritSong waves to chat , reads up , to join in
[05:27:59] <Hrafnbjorn> wb SpiritSong
[05:28:04] <SpiritSong> ty :)
[05:28:14] <MissSugar> and i really do try to understand where people are coming from with their beliefs even if they seem way out there
[05:28:39] <MissSugar> because what i believe is kinda crazy if you think about it
[05:29:03] <Hrafnbjorn> could be said about everyone regarding beliefs somewhere
[05:29:55] *** Aria is now known as Aria|away
[05:30:32] <MissSugar> yeah 
[05:30:50] <MissSugar> which is why i try not to tie my beliefs in with my ego
[05:31:03] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[05:31:08] <MissSugar> but
[05:31:13] <MissSugar> i fail sometimes on that one
[05:31:27] <Hrafnbjorn> are you familiar with Shaka Buddhas life-story?
[05:31:48] <Hrafnbjorn> or last life story I guess it would be... he has many different life stories going into past
[05:31:50] <MissSugar> yes
[05:32:51] <Hrafnbjorn> I find it lovely how when he confronted Mara, he understood it as a corruption in the self, and in battling it, he removed his ego form the equation, and THATs where his enlightenment originated
[05:33:07] <Hrafnbjorn> *from
[05:33:21] <MissSugar> its hard though, because the ego hides in your mind and pretends its your friend, that you need it to survive
[05:33:25] <SpiritSong> that's prettyu interesting
[05:33:39] <Hrafnbjorn> agreed, MissSugar
[05:33:50] <MissSugar> have you seen the movie revolver
[05:33:56] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah
[05:34:07] <Hrafnbjorn> the Korean one?
[05:34:11] <MissSugar> no
[05:34:15] <MissSugar> the one by guy richie
[05:34:20] <Hrafnbjorn> oh, I dunno then
[05:34:36] <MissSugar> its all about the ego, the self, the higher self
[05:34:40] <MissSugar> its a crazy movie
[05:35:17] <SpiritSong> action movie?
[05:35:32] <Hrafnbjorn> in Heathen lore one can see the Odinic triad that gave humanity its being you could take it as ego, self, and higher self
[05:36:25] <MissSugar> it is an action movie
[05:36:36] <Hrafnbjorn> Odin (inspiration) being higher self, Ve (enclosure) being the self, and Vili (will) being the ego
[05:37:09] <MissSugar> there is this scene where the main protagonist is having a conversation with his ego and the ego says "what would you be with out me"
[05:37:39] <Hrafnbjorn> very Zen, lol
[05:39:31] <MissSugar> watch it!
[05:41:40] <MissSugar> i dont think that voodoo has anything really in the way of an understanding of the ego, it tends to want to reamain seperate from philosophy

[07:37:12] <Iona> lol...  free coffee indeed!  Here I was thinking they just couldn't get over the fact that they quit.
[07:37:44] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It's because people replace their addiction for alcohol (or whatever) with an addiction to meetings.
[07:38:01] <DawnBatGuano> that doesn't sound healthy

[07:42:28] <DawnBatGuano> maybe cause ghosts are angry that they're dead
[07:43:15] <Iona> Death is perfectly safe.  It happens to everyone.
[07:44:58] <DawnBatGuano> it's unhealthy
[07:47:00] <Iona> Life is unhealthy.  Look at sickness.  The dead don't get sick.

[08:04:46] <Iona> it seems to be a ghostly kind of topic right now.
[08:04:48] <DawnBatGuano> I was thinking we should debate Christianity but eh
[08:05:08] <Iona> what's unclear about it DawnBatGuano?
[08:05:39] <DawnBatGuano> Oh nothing.
[08:05:51] <DawnBatGuano> I just think it'd be interesting to through around opinions on it
[08:06:30] <Hrafnbjorn> I dont have any opinions about it personaly
[08:06:31] <Iona> mmmm ... if it serves someone in a tangible way, I'm okay with throwing opinions around...  but otherwise, no.
[08:06:42] <DawnBatGuano> alrigth
[08:06:48] <DawnBatGuano> How aout the origin of Holidays>
[08:07:25] <Iona> as old as the development of the calendar.  Stonehenge is an example.
[08:07:33] <DawnBatGuano> :D
[08:07:49] <DawnBatGuano> I need to study Kemetic Holidays, kind of hard because therewas like....a ton of them
[08:08:21] <Iona> (according to recent archaeological evidence) Stonehenge was an attraction and had a community which lasted for millennia... 
[08:08:26] <SpiritSong> just do one at a time, you'll get to know them well enough
[08:08:30] <Iona> Stonehenge's design is aligned to the stars.
[08:08:35] <Hrafnbjorn> often holidays serve a cultural purpose... if ya arent part of that culture, not much point to them
[08:08:38] <DawnBatGuano> Yep
[08:08:40] <DawnBatGuano> same as the pyramids
[08:08:43] <Iona> You don't attract people without events.
[08:08:50] <Iona> Agreed Hraf
[08:08:56] <DawnBatGuano> Im probably only gonna cleebrate the Kemetic New Year. Need to find the name
[08:09:43] <Iona> I find that I celebrate my own birthday only to keep others happy, otherwise I prefer not to even mark it...
[08:10:03] <DawnBatGuano> Mom doesn't do holidays and such cause they're commercilizaed
[08:10:05] <SpiritSong> when is the kemetic new year?
[08:10:06] <Iona> happiness is important.
[08:10:40] <DawnBatGuano> SpiritSong: Roughly around August 6 is when it starts I think
[08:11:18] <Iona> Autumn Equinox?
[08:11:23] * Iona checks the dates...
[08:11:34] <DawnBatGuano> its called Wep Ronpet
[08:11:41] <SpiritSong> ahhh
[08:12:21] <DawnBatGuano> it's like
[08:12:23] <DawnBatGuano> 5 days long
[08:12:26] <Iona> well, the autumn equinox this year is Sept 22...  calendar skew may be accountable, but it's as good as guesswork without doing the math...
[08:12:52] <DawnBatGuano> Wep Ronpet is the extra 5 days at the end of the year (in the Egyptian Solar Calendar)
[08:17:02] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, this Old Man is feeling a bit drained, so it's off to bed.

[08:24:02] <DawnBatGuano> the Solar Calendar is a lot different than ours so somethings may have got mistranslated
[08:26:01] <DawnBatGuano> ugh
[08:26:08] <DawnBatGuano> nice to be back with intelligent humans
[08:26:44] <DawnBatGuano> someone said if I am apathetic to humanity, I should kill myself.
[08:27:42] <Iona> whoever told you humanity is intelligent is selling you something.
[08:27:50] <DawnBatGuano> xD
[08:28:00] <Iona> probably a nice half-truth.
[08:28:14] <DawnBatGuano> I'm just kind of annoyed with how chaotic humanity can be, especially as of late.
[08:28:41] <Iona> Why do you work yourself up with anxiety?
[08:28:56] <DawnBatGuano> I never thought of that.
[08:29:09] <DawnBatGuano> Thank you, especially for saying it in a humane manner
[08:30:20] <Iona> You're welcome :)
[08:31:39] <SpiritSong> whoever told you to kill yourslef....seriously..cut them out of your life.....
[08:31:52] <DawnBatGuano> it was just a stranger really
[08:31:55] <SpiritSong> thats just my opinion...i dont care why they said it because its just wrong
[08:32:06] <DawnBatGuano> it is
[08:32:22] <SpiritSong> well im glad they are not in your life

[08:33:36] <DawnBatGuano> If I wanted to and was apathetic enough I could just send a virus to their pc
[08:33:53] <DawnBatGuano> Im not angry though, I have no feeling right now xD
[08:34:04] <SpiritSong> they arent worth your time
[08:34:22] <DawnBatGuano> exactly

[08:43:14] <Iona> nope.

[08:43:43] <Iona> DawnBatGuano: because I know my place.
[08:43:50] <DawnBatGuano> I see.
[08:44:32] * Iona smiles...
[08:44:39] <DawnBatGuano> I wonder if there's any form of mythical bat creatures.

[09:40:50] <DawnBatGuano> I heard of that
[09:41:19] <MissSugar> they treat there dead quite respectfully 
[09:41:29] * DawnBatGuano casts a zombie spell on all of the seafood MissSugar will buy for the next 10 years
[09:41:30] <MissSugar> it probably helps with the grieving process as well
[09:42:08] <Iona> yeah :)

[09:45:52] <DawnBatGuano> ah
[09:46:08] <DawnBatGuano> back in Kemet there was a lot of care and love for the passed
[09:46:52] <DawnBatGuano> nearly a whole year for mummification (mostly the higher ups though)
[09:48:24] <DawnBatGuano> I had a realization
[09:48:32] <DawnBatGuano> I might need to do a regression.

[22:27:50] <DawnBatGuano> Question....am I on mute or ?
[22:27:59] <Widders> Sometimes that hits the spot
[22:28:07] <Widders> Hi dawn
[22:28:13] <DawnBatGuano> hai xD
[22:28:43] <Widders> Not looking forward to being social
[22:28:54] <Hrafnbjorn> no you arent DawnBatGuano
[22:28:54] <DawnBatGuano> Sorry, I'm just trying to understand this existence at this oint.
[22:28:57] <DawnBatGuano> :p
[22:29:08] <Widders> So me thinks I'll wrap a hoop to still my brain
[22:29:20] <Hrafnbjorn> family is stressful sometimes
[22:29:21] <Widders> Try gardening
[22:29:37] <Widders> Yea...
[22:29:38] <DawnBatGuano> oh it's not family.
[22:29:48] <DawnBatGuano> Just seems we are in an Existential Void of Anguish
[22:30:05] <Widders> I love them, but I'm really tired and mom has the flu
[22:30:16] <Widders> I don't wanna catch that
[22:30:37] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[22:30:40] <Widders> Why would a go to a party with the Effin flu
[22:30:43] <DawnBatGuano> I suddenly feel....deep
[22:31:12] <Widders> It's anguish if you perceive and hold onto anguish
[22:31:26] <Widders> It's not if you don't
[22:31:28] *** Joins: Edward (Edward@my.vhost)
[22:31:28] <Abraxas> Welcome, Edward. The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.
[22:31:30] <DawnBatGuano> I dunno. Seems like happiness is just an illusion.
[22:31:36] <Widders> Hi Edward
[22:31:43] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa Edward!
[22:31:44] <Widders> Depends what you focus on
[22:31:49] <Edward> Yo Widders 
[22:31:51] <Edward> Heilsa Hrafnbjorn 
[22:32:00] <Widders> Greetings
[22:32:03] <DawnBatGuano> well happiness seems to be a temporary thing.\
[22:32:17] <Widders> Everything is temporary
[22:32:34] <CantSirDraggin_> except taxes
[22:32:56] <Edward> I like to think that Happiness is temporary, but joy, being something that you ascend it, is eternal.
[22:32:58] <Widders> Even taxes, your part will end eventually
[22:33:05] <Edward> to*
[22:33:35] <Widders> Oneness is my idea of joy
[22:33:40] <DawnBatGuano> I accept the fact I live apart from this existence not only Temporally but Cosmically as well so as to distract my self from this existence.
[22:33:43] <Widders> That will come when I die
[22:34:25] <Widders> Till then I'm content to admire the things around me and learn from what pleases me and displeases me
[22:34:55] <DawnBatGuano> I've grown bored and apathetic of the material world.
[22:35:11] <Widders> Many of us have
[22:35:28] <Widders> So, embrace non material things
[22:35:35] <DawnBatGuano> Like my universes?
[22:36:00] <Widders> Find joy in sharing, helping, loving, and adventures, learning new things
[22:36:02] <Edward> Embrace the love of friends and family, thats what I say.
[22:36:16] <Widders> ^
[22:36:43] <DawnBatGuano> I don't even feel that.
[22:37:23] <Widders> Then it's time to go out and reconnect with nature
[22:37:36] <Widders> Feel wonder again
[22:37:51] <DawnBatGuano> Tried that really.
[22:38:04] <Widders> Keep trying
[22:38:26] <Widders> Does one quit trying to ride a bike because they fell?
[22:38:29] <DawnBatGuano> well until I get on anti-anxiety medications that probably won't happen
[22:38:58] <Widders> Then that's your decision
[22:39:28] <Edward> Well, you could just sit in your yard even
[22:39:33] <DawnBatGuano> not exactly. It's the only logical option.
[22:40:08] <DawnBatGuano> now that I think about it.
[22:40:16] <DawnBatGuano> Why go for logic when it hardly exists anymore.
[22:40:20] <Widders> Once you say " this is the only logical option" you've shut the door on everything else
[22:41:11] <Widders> There's a lot of folks who keep trying, dispirited all logical options being unavailable
[22:41:19] <Widders> And succeeding
[22:41:23] <DawnBatGuano> I try my hardest to be a source of logic and order, but it seems pointless now
[22:41:25] <Edward> Logical options? What are you a Vulcan?
[22:41:55] <DawnBatGuano> Not really. I just try to see things in a more sensical manner
[22:42:41] <Widders> Your in a room of witches and other believers of the supernatural we tend to embrace taking outside the box
[22:42:48] <DawnBatGuano> I've already considered Sith Lordship today.
[22:42:48] <Widders> ;)
[22:42:54] <Edward> Sith Lordship
[22:42:55] <Edward> :P
[22:43:23] <DawnBatGuano> why be order when there's chaos all over.
[22:43:43] <Edward> Ya know DawnBatGuano, I think your problem is that you try to be one or the other instead of balancing.
[22:43:58] <DawnBatGuano> possily.
[22:43:58] <Widders> Yea my garlic buns came out awesome !
[22:44:05] <DawnBatGuano> Just give into darkness.
[22:44:13] <DawnBatGuano> Widders: Why not Japanese Pork Buns? :P
[22:44:25] <Widders> Vegetarian
[22:44:36] <DawnBatGuano> make water chestnut buns
[22:44:44] <Widders> And I do make them for special occasions
[22:44:48] <Edward> Why not Japanese not pork buns?
[22:45:25] <Widders> But this is a bbq- don't need meat in the bread too
[22:45:34] <DawnBatGuano> Wait
[22:45:35] <Edward> Cant hurt
[22:45:35] <DawnBatGuano> what
[22:45:51] <DawnBatGuano> Ooooh
[22:45:55] <DawnBatGuano> peppermint buns?
[22:45:57] <Widders> I can track you to make them if you ever want
[22:46:03] <Widders> Teach
[22:46:15] <DawnBatGuano> the garlick
[22:46:17] <DawnBatGuano> ?
[22:46:18] <Iona> Widders, how about jam or creme filled pastries?
[22:46:36] <Widders> Not for a bbq thanks
[22:46:58] <Widders> This is going with bbq and tater salad and Mac and cheese
[22:47:23] <DawnBatGuano> cream cheese garlick buns sound good
[22:47:24] <Widders> Thigh for dessert oh hell yea
[22:47:26] <Iona> Hmmm. Jello salad?
[22:48:07] <DawnBatGuano> Widders: Why not Soylent? :P
[22:48:08] <Widders> Done cooking. Made fresh salsa, Tate salad, garlic buns and roasted beet salad with blue cheese
[22:48:38] <Widders> Jello repeats on me
[22:48:40] <Iona> Mmmmmm

[22:50:13] <Widders> Red river jasper and a moonstone
[22:50:32] <Hrafnbjorn> no, I didnt do any more yet
[22:50:53] <CantSirDraggin_> i've been putting off doing this carnelian for weeks now
[22:51:05] <Widders> Why for?
[22:51:14] <CantSirDraggin_> may be that i don't need to be wearing it, heh
[22:51:22] <Widders> Lol!!!
[22:51:30] <CantSirDraggin_> every time i go to start on it i just stop feeling like doing it
[22:51:32] <Widders> Make it and box it
[22:51:34] <Hrafnbjorn> I took the one I did yesterday over to show my mom, and she decided she was gonna keep it
[22:51:49] <Widders> Lol !!!!
[22:51:57] <Iona> Of course.
[22:51:59] <Widders> The obsidian?
[22:52:26] <CantSirDraggin_> the intent is to kinda annoy the x a little with it though
[22:52:55] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah
[22:53:04] <Widders> Won't that keep a cord to you?
[22:53:10] <Iona> Its beautiful
[22:53:19] <Widders> I'm more about severing that stuff
[22:53:36] <CantSirDraggin_> nah, it's just on me, and we're way past the worrying about cording thing anyway
[22:53:45] <Widders> That's good
[22:54:06] <CantSirDraggin_> well, ummm, more that there's still nothing to do about it
[22:55:28] <Widders> Can't wait till you get to move :)
[22:55:41] <Widders> No more snow!
[22:55:45] <CantSirDraggin_> are/am waiting, lol
[22:55:58] <Widders> Ans crazy ass weather
[22:56:09] <CantSirDraggin_> snow's annoying but managable, but rare here
[22:56:15] <CantSirDraggin_> that's the thing there

[22:56:29] <CantSirDraggin_> tornadoes and full on humidity

[23:36:22] <Hrafnbjorn> nothing even similar
[23:38:09] <DawnBatGuano> intriguing

[23:39:27] <Abraxas> Welcome, Aedylthryd. The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.
[23:39:43] <Hrafnbjorn> there is the elves, and the Vanic gods, which are lower than the Aesic gods in some respects
[23:39:52] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa Aedylthryd!
[23:40:01] <DawnBatGuano> wait
[23:40:04] <Aedylthryd> No, Abraxas. I accepted myself as my family's greatest disappointment long, long ago.
[23:40:07] <DawnBatGuano> Elves are Celestials?
[23:40:18] <Aedylthryd> Can be considered as such.
[23:40:19] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, and no at same time
[23:40:42] <DawnBatGuano> Oh
[23:40:47] <DawnBatGuano> confuzzling
[23:41:12] <DawnBatGuano> curioser and curiouser
[23:41:19] <Hrafnbjorn> depending in region, elves are the point between human and Vanir... so human evolves to elf, elf to Vanir, Vanir to Aesir (through marriage).... some sagas also consider elves and Vanir to be same thing
[23:41:40] <DawnBatGuano> Hmmm
[23:41:43] <DawnBatGuano> Intriguing.
[23:42:03] <Hrafnbjorn> go west into Iceland, and the elves are a bit different though
[23:42:35] <Hrafnbjorn> in Iceland they were classified not AS, but WITH the Irish fae... both classified as huldrafolk (hidden folk)
[23:42:46] <DawnBatGuano> ooooh

[23:46:19] <Hrafnbjorn> other beings similar to what ya ask could be the valkyrjar, the ettins, and some other beasties (like Lokis brood, who are still giant from both Loki and his mates)
[23:50:49] <DawnBatGuano> Loki is basically a Scandinavian Zeus right
[23:50:58] <Hrafnbjorn> no
[23:51:11] <DawnBatGuano> Well I meant the whole breeding thing
[23:51:23] <Hrafnbjorn> linguisticaly Tyr relates to Zeus (Tyrs oldest name is Ziu)
[23:51:47] <Hrafnbjorn> Loki doesnt really have anything in Greek lore to compare to
[23:52:07] <Hrafnbjorn> Tyr was often the 'leader' of the Aesic gods
[23:52:21] <DawnBatGuano> ahhh
[23:52:33] <DawnBatGuano> well I was curious cause of Fenrir and Sleipnnir
[23:52:58] <Hrafnbjorn> the brreding aspect is common among the Germanic mythic beings... gods, elves, giants, all sorts of things can procreate together
[23:53:19] *** Joins: oath (oath@sorcery-15ldgn.client.mchsi.com)
[23:53:19] <Abraxas> Welcome, oath. Enlightenment doesn't occur from sitting around visualizing images of light, but from integrating the darker aspects of the self into the conscious personality.
[23:53:34] <Hrafnbjorn> Sleipnir is the product of Loki (as a mare) and a stallion... Fenrir is 2 giants (Loki and Angrbodha)
[23:53:39] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa oath!
[23:53:53] <DawnBatGuano> Ahhh
[23:54:49] <DawnBatGuano> how was the World Tree created
[23:54:49] <Hrafnbjorn> one main difference rgarding the gods is that they could not, or do not seem to change gender... Loki does quite often (but he isnt one of the gods)
[23:55:05] <DawnBatGuano> he's half though right?
[23:55:30] <Hrafnbjorn> its not an existing thing, it is a metaphore, but when Odin, Vili, and Ve gave structure to the cosmos, it was organized in a tree pattern
[23:55:36] <DawnBatGuano> ahhh
[23:55:41] <DawnBatGuano> Odin is the oldest right?
[23:55:44] <Hrafnbjorn> no Loki is 100% giant
[23:56:06] <Hrafnbjorn> Odin and his 2 brothers are the oldest of the sentient beings, yes
[23:56:21] <DawnBatGuano> Fun
[23:56:36] <DawnBatGuano> how did Loki even come to be in Asgard? (if he evr was)
[23:57:00] <Hrafnbjorn> the first 'being' was Audhumbla, which was a primal, androgynous bovine... it shaped 2 forms out of salt/ice, by licking the salt... those 2 beings were Odins parents
[23:57:34] <DawnBatGuano> ew
[23:57:50] <DawnBatGuano> sounds yummy :P
[23:57:54] <Hrafnbjorn> Loki was allowed ino Asgard because he became Odins blood-oathed brother... he was never allowed into the gods' council though, so he was never accepted into the actual structure, just the residence
[23:58:28] <DawnBatGuano> ahhh
[23:58:37] <DawnBatGuano> and Asgard is described yes?
[23:58:48] <Hrafnbjorn> Lokissenna is the funniest of all the sagas, and is about when the gods were having council, and Loki was jealous cause he wasnt allowed, so he busted in and started insulting all the Aesir and Vanir
[23:59:02] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, Asgard has some vague description
[23:59:23] <Hrafnbjorn> Valhalla has better description, but there is some for Asgard as a whole
[23:59:29] <DawnBatGuano> may I have a glimps of this description?
