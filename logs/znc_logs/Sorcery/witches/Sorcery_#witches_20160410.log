[04:01:54] <MissSugar> cute
[04:01:57] <MissSugar> hey Dawn
[04:02:09] <DawnBat> em hotep MissSugar ^^
[04:03:41] <DawnBat> I don't know if this is odd of a question but, is there such a thing as a Voodoo Wedding?
[04:06:52] <MissSugar> yes
[04:07:02] <DawnBat> What are they like?
[04:08:27] <MissSugar> usually when vodou or voodoo talks about wedding its marriage to a Lwa
[04:08:43] <DawnBat> oh
[04:08:43] <MissSugar> an intimate spirit relationship 
[04:08:53] <DawnBat> I kinda meant like...mortal and fleshy
[04:09:06] <DawnBat> Although that is kinda cool
[04:09:17] <MissSugar> actually not as common as weddings to the lwa
[04:09:26] <DawnBat> wait what?
[04:09:39] <DawnBat> So marrying a Spirit/Divine/Entity etc. is quite common?
[04:09:58] <MissSugar> yup
[04:10:11] <DawnBat> that's a new one for me
[04:10:57] <MissSugar> a voodoo wedding in the flesh is mostly similar to a pagan handfasting
[04:11:13] <MissSugar> a wedding to a lwa is mostly a catholic type wedding
[04:11:19] <MissSugar> which is weird
[04:11:21] <MissSugar> but hey
[04:11:31] <DawnBat> Intriguing
[04:11:44] <DawnBat> I was thinking jumping the broom ( Now I sound racist I guess )
[04:12:23] <MissSugar> no that actually is an African tradition
[04:12:38] <DawnBat> Ahhhhh
[04:13:03] <DawnBat> I know that, just considering Voodoo's Origins and other such things I thought they might be present
[04:13:18] <MissSugar> you would be correct
[04:13:58] <DawnBat> So what's the reason for marrying an lwa?
[04:15:21] <MissSugar> to be closer to your Met Tet, to show your love and devotion to that Lwa
[04:15:31] <DawnBat> Makes sense
[04:15:48] <DawnBat> also Tet as in tete being the French word for head?
[04:16:30] <MissSugar> yup
[04:16:37] <DawnBat> funnnn
[04:16:37] <DawnBat> :D
[04:16:37] <MissSugar> the Lwa that resides in your head
[04:17:31] <DawnBat> for some reason I feel connected to Voodoo in a way. Unlike when I learn about other faiths.
[04:20:00] <MissSugar> well its one of those things that you really have to dedicate study too or you might end up in trouble
[04:20:21] <DawnBat> that I understand. I find it real fascinating though
[04:22:57] <DawnBat> Another odd question, is there any kind of vampire-esque entities in Voodoo?
[04:24:25] <MissSugar> there is the Baron Criminel who eats flesh but is often called on by those who wish to do crimes undetected
