[03:31:37] <Iona> SpiritSong: currently international sociopolitics...
[03:31:55] <SpiritSong> ahh, so you're interestin in using your knowledge to help people?
[03:32:01] <SpiritSong> that sounds interesting iona
[03:32:41] <Raggiedmon> I try
[03:33:16] <SpiritSong> ah, so are you interested in healing?
[03:33:40] <Raggiedmon> I have tried healing, sometimes I think I am good at it
[03:33:58] <SpiritSong> faltering in confidence at times?
[03:35:09] <Raggiedmon> Sometimes I think I am having amazing sucess but looking at it am unsure of if have been benifical
[03:36:22] <SpiritSong> i think the energy flow ebbs and flows naturally. dont doubt yourself though, trust in the success
[03:36:23] <SpiritSong> :)
[03:36:24] <Raggiedmon> Hopefully my attempts do not harm, but my ablity to sense is rather low and damaged
[03:36:49] <SpiritSong> as long as you cleanse yourself and your space beforehand, you should be fine in terms of doing harm
[03:37:11] <SpiritSong> why do you say that, have you been low in energy yourself? feeling sick or down?
[03:38:09] <Raggiedmon> honestly I recover easily from damage, just smoke some pipe tabacoo
[03:38:37] <SpiritSong> are  you shielding before healings?
[03:38:43] <Raggiedmon> How do you think is the best way of cleanseing yourself
[03:38:51] <Raggiedmon> no I dont sheild much anymore
[03:39:08] <Raggiedmon> visulization is damaged an my sheild were likly to offensive
[03:39:14] <SpiritSong> i usually use sage smoke before "brushing" negativity from my aura
[03:39:42] <SpiritSong> offensive? how so
[03:40:48] <Raggiedmon> ummm say you put up three shields, one basic, the one under it designed so the sheild itself is sharp in places designed to cut
[03:41:02] <Raggiedmon> like attaching spinning razor blades
[03:41:18] <SpiritSong> nods
[03:42:05] <SpiritSong> maybe try a gentler one if intution says that method is offensive
[03:43:24] <Raggiedmon> my visulization is to damaged/interfeared with, but I am healing an recovering from attacks much more rapidly
[03:44:07] <SpiritSong> you will prolly be ready to get in there again after some time :)
[03:45:09] <Raggiedmon> possibly, I seem to get attacked a fair amount so my recovery by getting hit so many times is likly my path to recovery
[03:45:40] <SpiritSong> people sending attacks or just negative energy
[03:46:27] <Raggiedmon> likly both
[03:46:33] <Raggiedmon> its not really a bother
[03:47:08] <SpiritSong> i hope you  recover enough to block them soon
[03:48:08] <Raggiedmon> I spent most of my life dreaming, visulizing story after story when sitting around or going to sleep, I miss it but now I spend more time "active"

[04:28:42] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, she hunts all sorts of little critters, birds, lizards, rats... she has gotten a couple opposums
[04:29:12] <BansheeTears> Opossums are pretty darn big
[04:29:21] <BansheeTears> Does she eat them?
[04:29:26] <DawnBat> how about New York Rats?
[04:29:27] <DawnBat> :p
[04:29:35] <Hrafnbjorn> no, she leaves them by the front door
[04:29:48] <Hrafnbjorn> kinda cat like in that respect
[04:30:38] <DawnBat> heard that cats do that cause they think their owners suck at hunting xD
[04:31:01] <SpiritSong> whats the difference between a possom and an opossum
[04:31:11] <Hrafnbjorn> ?
[04:31:13] <DawnBat> i think they're the same
[04:31:25] <Hrafnbjorn> just different spelling I think
[04:32:23] <BansheeTears> Lol!! Like here ya go... You cook it!
[04:32:34] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[04:32:43] <DawnBat> I'd a possum
[04:32:46] <DawnBat> eat**
[04:33:02] <Hrafnbjorn> she likes to roll in her catches if I dont find them soon enough, so I always have to look around to make sure I got them
[04:33:25] <BansheeTears> Hahaaaaa!!

[04:36:19] <Hrafnbjorn> Sasha likes to hunt with me.  One of the only things I have taught her is to inspect where I tell her too.  I can either point a finger, or walking stick, and she will inspect

[04:36:21] <BansheeTears> ;)
[04:36:32] <SpiritSong> they proly give us hunts our of worry for our health

[04:36:58] <SpiritSong> thats so clever Hrafnbjorn
[04:37:04] <Hrafnbjorn> she learned sit, and stay all on her own... she learned lay down too, but she thinks 'drop it' means lay down, lol
[04:37:10] <BansheeTears> Lol
[04:37:13] <SpiritSong> hehehee
[04:37:17] <Hrafnbjorn> she goes after snakes unfortunatly
[04:38:06] <Hrafnbjorn> there is a mint green one here that I would swear plays with her in the tall grass, cause it never goes into hidding, just goes back and forth, and its really fast

[04:56:48] <BansheeTears> North:  have you read cs Lewis? Out of the silent planet?
[04:57:11] <North> I have the book, but been ages since I've read it...if at all

[05:00:53] <BansheeTears> I vote for vodka, if you don't have to work
[05:01:02] <BansheeTears> Coffee if you do
[05:01:34] <North> vodka if work especially sucks
[05:01:36] <BansheeTears> You sound like you embrace some eastern philosophy

[05:14:46] <BansheeTears> ...Netflix marathon?
[05:14:57] <MissSugar> i wanted to do some painting
[05:15:10] <BansheeTears> Hard to art when your grays
[05:15:24] <BansheeTears> Gray
[05:15:24] <MissSugar> Spirit sent me some water color so i wanted to do the tarot with mixed medium, acrylic and watercolor 
[05:15:40] <BansheeTears> Ohh sounds lovely
[05:16:10] <BansheeTears> How many card to go?
[05:16:14] <MissSugar> i have had problems with water color in the past, i had an art teacher once tell me that i painted like i was icing a cake
[05:16:35] <BansheeTears> Ever tried oils
[05:16:44] <MissSugar> i havent tried oils yet
[05:16:54] <BansheeTears> Oils stumped me
[05:17:06] <MissSugar> i do want to get there eventually i know they are all about texture 
[05:17:07] <BansheeTears> Couldn't get the knack
[05:17:35] <BansheeTears> Like water colors tho
[05:17:51] <BansheeTears> They're subtle or bold
[05:18:10] <MissSugar> well i figured i would give watercolors another go 
[05:18:21] <BansheeTears> What card are you working on?
[05:18:41] <MissSugar> the first one still, the more i look at the more i hate it LOL
[05:18:58] <BansheeTears> Why not start again?
[05:19:17] <BansheeTears> I do that when I go back and look at my jewelry
[05:19:35] <BansheeTears> I see only the flaws
[05:19:36] <MissSugar> i am thinking that i might do that
[05:20:29] <BansheeTears> It's hard to not pick everything apart
[05:20:55] <MissSugar> being a creator is hard, everything you create is like "i could do better"
[05:21:04] <BansheeTears> Yup totally
[05:21:18] <MissSugar> or you loathe it entirely
[05:21:23] <BansheeTears> It would be hard to be a god
[05:21:28] <BansheeTears> Yup
[05:22:08] <MissSugar> or you see some art that is so good that you are like "welp i am going to go dig a hole over here"
[05:22:18] <BansheeTears> Yup!!'
[05:22:37] <North> <Sugar>  "I hate you, First Card."   <Card>  "No you don't."   <Sugar>  "Yes, I do."   <Card>  "Do you, really?"   <Sugar>  "Really, really."   *interval of silence*   <Card>  "You've won this battle."
[05:22:39] <BansheeTears> It costs money to practice
[05:23:00] <BansheeTears> Shits expensive
[05:23:27] <MissSugar> LOL thats why i am using house paint to go over the canvas
[05:23:44] <BansheeTears> Lol!!
[05:23:47] <BansheeTears> Love it
[05:24:40] <BansheeTears> Acrylic... Does it lend well to layering?
[05:24:55] <MissSugar> it does
[05:25:03] <BansheeTears> Cool :)
[05:25:40] <BansheeTears> With watercolor .. I go through a butt load of paper
[05:26:47] <MissSugar> thats why i prefer canvas boards
[05:26:50] <BansheeTears> Has anyone done a tarot of the lwa?
[05:27:01] <BansheeTears> Like the Orishas
[05:27:54] <MissSugar> the Voodoo tarot of new orleans is the biggest one

[05:29:54] <BansheeTears> I can't
[05:30:08] <MissSugar> it took me a while to get use too, because while it follows the tarot format the meanings differentiate from the traditional tarot

[05:30:59] <BansheeTears> Love it
[05:31:11] <MissSugar> if i have to do a reading, like i am being paid, then i will get the reading done, but i dont like too
[05:31:13] <BansheeTears> But the interpretations are a bit different
[05:32:19] <BansheeTears> I hate trying to read when I'm gray... I feel like it bleeds through
[05:33:00] <MissSugar> i can understand that

[05:39:07] <SeekTheLimitless-ICTX> Rider-Waite
[05:39:28] <BansheeTears> That was my first :) good deck
[05:39:48] <MissSugar> to tell the truth the lady i replaced as a reader in the occult store use to charge $5 for a reading and she would have her little booklet in hand while she just read out the readings, so i wasnt that nervous the bar was set pretty low
[05:40:18] <BansheeTears> Ahh, that would help
[05:40:50] <BansheeTears> I have a cheat sheet

[06:31:32] <Keith> what part of canada?
[06:31:32] <Iona> That works
[06:32:25] <Escovan> uhh, the part where some other girl lives ... Near Ontario I believe
[06:33:06] <Keith> lol ok
[06:33:19] <Keith> so CST
[06:33:29] <Keith> and ontario is a province
[06:34:16] <Escovan> My Canada clock says it´s 0:33 now
[06:34:26] <Keith> so that is eastern.
[06:34:36] <Keith> oops... CST is Manitoba i thinks
[06:34:59] <Keith> anywhos.... it is great to keep track of a friends time.
[06:37:11] <Escovan> I´m gonna add some special herb to my cigarette...
[06:38:06] <Escovan> In dutch we call it: ¨Een joint in de morgen, is een dag zonder zorgen¨ - Which means: ¨A reefer in the morning is a day without worries¨ but it doesn´t rhyme in English

[06:49:53] <Escovan> The´d better!
[06:50:08] <Escovan> They need to compensate for 6 euros of food
[06:50:40] <North> how many, altogether?
[06:50:47] <Escovan> just 2
[06:51:25] <Escovan> But someone already promised us 2 youngers ones if these got too old.
[06:51:43] <Escovan> -s
[06:53:08] <North> not sure how long those things live
[06:55:07] <Escovan> on average they don´t get older than 10 years. 3 years for bio-industry chickens till up to 20 years for specially bread chickens
[06:55:15] <North> ah, k
[06:56:56] <North> clucky goodness
[07:02:50] <Keith> i got some friends just west of me getting some chickens shortly.  once they prep the coops

[07:21:52] <Escovan> did you notice coffee takes less time to be cooled down to drinking temperature?

[07:22:05] <Keith> compared to?
[07:22:09] <Escovan> tea
[07:22:19] <Keith> i find them about the same
[07:22:46] <Keith> i dont see anything that would make them different
[07:22:48] <Escovan> It´s because tea water get´s boiled, and put in a glass, and coffee goes throug a machine
[07:23:04] <Keith> i do my tea through a coffee maker
[07:23:13] <Escovan> :D
[07:23:40] <North> I get my coffee from the planet Venus
[07:23:43] <Keith> and.... not all tea water is boiled.
[07:23:44] <North> nothin' hotter than that
[07:23:58] <Keith> the proper temp for most black teas is at 88C
[07:24:38] <Iona> That's hot
[07:24:40] <Keith> and green or herbal teas are at less than that
[07:24:57] <Keith> if your water is to hot your tea becomes bitter
[07:25:09] <Keith> :)
[07:25:18] <Keith> 12C below boiling :)
[07:25:22] <Iona> 88 Celsius?
[07:25:32] <Keith> 100C is boiling
[07:25:38] <Iona> No
[07:25:42] <Escovan> yes
[07:25:45] <Keith> yes it is
[07:25:48] <Keith> 212F
[07:26:07] <Escovan> We use that system. And -40F equals -40C
[07:26:31] <Keith> for every degree you go up in celcius you go up 1.8 degrees F
[07:26:51] <Iona> Ahhh... That's still hot...
[07:27:03] <Keith> yes it is.
[07:27:08] <Iona> Thank you
[07:27:16] <Keith> can leave serious burns on your skin if not careful
[07:28:34] <Keith> but....... i must check my tea.... brb
[07:28:35] <Escovan> Yes. I once had a coffeemaker that boiled the water, and I was sleepy: I got 2nd degree burns
[07:29:54] <Iona> Oops...
[07:30:02] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ouch
[07:30:04] <Keith> that sucks... I am back
[07:30:56] <Iona> I once fell asleep in the southern Arizona summer sunbathing... 2nd degree sunburns on my legs...
[07:31:05] <Keith> ye-ouch
[07:31:17] <Escovan> sunburn is the worst.
[07:31:26] <Iona> (The tan lasted for years...)
[07:31:34] <Escovan> :D
[07:31:43] <Keith> i had my face sunburned.... worst feeling ever.... blistered and peeled.
[07:31:48] <Iona> ((Not suggested))
[07:32:07] <North> good heavens, Pris
[07:32:08] <Keith> i burn fairly easily
[07:32:17] <Iona> My skin peeled like potato chips...
[07:32:25] <North> :/
[07:32:32] <North> crazy times
[07:32:34] <Keith> for us the summer i burned my face it was about 45 C
[07:32:47] <Escovan> I actually got slightly burned each summer till 3 years back... then I heard this song: 
[07:32:49] * Escovan is now listening to: Quindon Tarver - Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)
[07:32:54] <Keith> it was about 113 F
[07:33:29] <Keith> i need more fruit
[07:33:45] <Keith> to put in my tea
[07:36:35] <Keith> have any of you tried that?
[07:36:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I've tried honey in my tea.
[07:37:41] <Keith> take a blender and chop up some fruit then add it to a pot of tea, let it sit for about30 minutes.  then strain out the fruit...... tastes yummy
[07:38:05] <North> interesting

[07:47:55] <Escovan> As you get older, odds for a dejavu get smaller, you might actually have lived through a very similar situation once before.
