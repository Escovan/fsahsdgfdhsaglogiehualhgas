[00:24:53] <Hrafnbjorn> hellos
[00:25:03] <North> hey there, Hraf
[00:25:11] <North> how's this 'n that?
[00:25:28] <Hrafnbjorn> all good thanks... you?
[00:25:44] <North> same!
[00:25:49] <North> I have a question
[00:25:55] <Hrafnbjorn> ?
[00:26:10] <North> does table salt ever expire?
[00:26:32] <Hrafnbjorn> not unless it gets mixed with something
[00:26:46] <North> excellent
[00:27:10] <North> found a box that might be around 10 years old
[00:27:24] <Hrafnbjorn> is it like a rock? lol
[00:27:52] <North> no, no, my friend...flowing like the sands of Time
[00:28:13] <Hrafnbjorn> wow, musta been in a nice dry hidding place then
[00:28:20] <North> also: I found this box in my cupboard...not, say, in the oleander bushes behind some 7-11
[00:28:31] <North> over the oven
[00:28:33] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[00:28:53] <Hrafnbjorn> I have a funny story about a type of salt (not the type to eat though)
[00:29:01] <North> do tell
[00:29:18] <Hrafnbjorn> in Minnesota they put a type of salt down on the roads in winter to prevent black ice
[00:29:36] <North> <-- well familiar with that thing
[00:29:44] <Hrafnbjorn> first year I was there, when the snow melted, I started finding all these huge crystals layin around
[00:29:46] <Quadpod88> you could eat that salt
[00:29:56] <North> hm
[00:30:08] <Hrafnbjorn> I was SSSOOOO excited... but then someone broke the bad news to me that it was just road salt, lol
[00:30:24] <Hrafnbjorn> I felt silly
[00:30:44] <North> people aren't born knowing these things
[00:31:04] <North> glad you didn't learn via searing abdominal cramps, at least
[00:31:26] <Hrafnbjorn> perhaps ya could Quadpod88... I didnt try to eat it, but I wouldnt trust salt thats been soaking the dirty snow and asphalt
[00:31:34] <Hrafnbjorn> lol, true, North
[00:31:54] <North> aye, Hraf....table salt's not *that* expensive
[00:32:57] <Hrafnbjorn> Im excited, just ordered a couple new books :) so forgive me if I seem a bit over excited
[00:33:32] <North> nice to have something to look forward to
[00:33:45] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed
[00:34:10] <Quadpod88> i ordered a new kilt
[00:34:21] <Hrafnbjorn> one is about the god Freyr, which is my family patron traditionaly, AND written by an author I already like a lot, and trust :)
[00:34:46] <Hrafnbjorn> Quadpod88.... be prepared to recieve a 'hard time' from me if ya post photos
[00:35:06] <Quadpod88> i'm so posting photos
[00:35:16] *** Quits: Chiaro (Chiaro@sorcery-njk172.compassbank.com) (Quit: SorceryNet Kiwi WebChat)
[00:35:28] <Quadpod88> lots of photos
[00:35:34] <Hrafnbjorn> lol, I fully support folk wearing kilts, I just like to give them hard time over it.  Kilts are actualy a fairly popular military uniform in several countries
[00:35:42] <Quadpod88> scary, scary photos
[00:36:28] <Quadpod88> from questionable angles
[00:36:31] <Hrafnbjorn> you need to do a photo like that Marylin Monroe one where she is standing over the subway grate blowing her skirt up, lol... that would be a greatly funny photo
[00:36:52] <North> don't give him any ideas     :/
[00:36:59] <Quadpod88> i just need a good wig
[00:36:59] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[00:37:38] <Quadpod88> can borrow some garments from the wife
[00:38:32] <Hrafnbjorn> the description of how the Scandinavians wore their cloak during viking period implies it was worn similar to a kilt
[00:39:24] <Quadpod88> alot of ppl wore garments similar to kilts
[00:39:45] <Quadpod88> celts are the only ones ridiculed for it
[00:41:33] <Hrafnbjorn> the Scots likely got it from the Pictish tribes rather than Celts.... no real evidence of Celts in Scotland. The continental Celts arent described as wearing them, but it is safe to assume, looking at where similar garments are popular, that they did
[00:41:42] <Quadpod88> i mean, have seen togas?
[00:42:17] <Quadpod88> i always felt that picts were celts
[00:42:19] <Hrafnbjorn> like in Kazikstan (sp?) that had a large Celtic population, a kilt like skirt is still popular
[00:42:51] <North> kilts seems somewhat disadvantageous in less than balmy climes
[00:42:59] <Hrafnbjorn> Pics are closely related to Celts in many of the pan-northern-Euro cultural traits, but different language group
[00:43:19] <Quadpod88> but similar blood ties
[00:43:44] <Hrafnbjorn> since it is language that seperates Celts form other N Euro cultures, they are classified different
[00:44:17] <Quadpod88> but celts all speak different languages
[00:44:23] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, same genetic groups made up both European Celts, and Picts... main difference is that the southern Celts, and the Asian Celts would be different genetic group
[00:44:37] <Quadpod88> hell, look at the iberians
[00:44:59] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, there were several Celtic languages, but all in the Celtic language group... same as hw there are many Germanic languages,but all in the Germanic group

[00:45:31] <Quadpod88> thats a fair analasys
[00:45:43] <Quadpod88> and that looks wrong
[00:46:07] <Quadpod88> analysis*
[00:46:10] <Quadpod88> better
[00:46:25] <Hrafnbjorn> there is still a lot of tenssion with linguists over whether the modern Gaelic languages should be included as Celtic or not... they show very very little Celtic influence, but who knows for sure
[00:47:00] <Hrafnbjorn> so, they invented a branch just for the Gaelics from the isles
[00:47:02] <Quadpod88> well, currently welsh is the closest
[00:47:36] <Hrafnbjorn> Celtic gaelic is almost completely unknown now, except the southern version, which is close to Greek
[00:48:18] <Quadpod88> hmm
[00:48:18] <Hrafnbjorn> infact the proto-Celtic dictionaries still use several Greek letters cause non-Greek languages dont actualy have the right sounds
[00:48:38] <Quadpod88> i should learn
[00:49:23] <Hrafnbjorn> we us compound letters for the Greek words in English, for example... all of the words with 'ph' to make the f sound are all from Greek.. but in Greek that ph is a single character
[00:49:53] <Quadpod88> gods i'll need help
[00:50:06] <Hrafnbjorn> once the site is up and running, I will post a Celtic gaelic dictionary
[00:50:24] <Quadpod88> you're awesome
[00:50:37] <Hrafnbjorn> its short, but at least it allows comparison with other languages
[00:50:44] <Quadpod88> i don't care what endor says
[00:51:14] <Hrafnbjorn> much is already familiar, familial terms, for example, are roughly same... mother, father, brother are all common to both Celtic gaelic, and Germanic languages
[00:51:35] <Hrafnbjorn> Endor is just jealous that Im not an Ewok :)
[00:52:15] <Quadpod88> we should get him some shampoo for that btw
[00:52:25] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[00:52:49] * Quadpod88 shivers
[00:53:06] <Hrafnbjorn> is it cold there?
[00:53:35] <Quadpod88> no, just thinking of ewoks
[00:53:43] <Hrafnbjorn> oh, ok
[00:54:32] <Quadpod88> nasty little critters
[00:54:50] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[00:55:16] <Hrafnbjorn> we should rename their planet Fleaheim instead of Endor
[00:56:26] <Quadpod88> ok, i can't keep this up, it's mean talking about endor's medical problems like this
[00:57:07] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[01:04:26] <Quadpod88> so
[01:04:46] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed
[01:06:10] <Quadpod88> the gauls
[01:06:19] <Quadpod88> thoughts?
[01:06:39] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm
[01:07:06] <Hrafnbjorn> I dont think they get credit where its due
[01:07:19] <Quadpod88> no they don't
[01:07:54] <Hrafnbjorn> for example, we give Rome all kinds of credit for their roads, but the Gaulish Celts built a way more vast network... they just used wood instead of cobblestone
[01:08:38] <Hrafnbjorn> plus the earliest evidence of European's visiting the Americas is a Celto-Iberian axe found down by the Amazon
[01:08:52] <Quadpod88> sadly, my history books gave the germans credit for roads
[01:10:24] <Hrafnbjorn> Germanic culture was still east of the Rhine at that time... it was not until the Frankish tribes moved in that central Europe was German.
[01:10:45] <Quadpod88> i mean ww2 germans
[01:10:54] <Hrafnbjorn> oh
[01:11:06] <Quadpod88> had bad history books
[01:11:32] <Hrafnbjorn> many of the Celtic roads are a bit hard to find since they are mostly decayed and/or buried in bogs

[01:13:54] <Quadpod88> stole everything
[01:14:20] <Hrafnbjorn> one problem with schools up to college level is that most teachers have educatiion in education, not the topic in question, so many history teachers simply dont understand whats going on, their job is to teach the text book

[01:34:14] <Hrafnbjorn> dates to the late Roman period though, so thats way earlier than 1000ce, which is the ealiest 'proof' of european settlements... the ax could possibly have been a family heirloom brought by Spaniards, and lost

[01:47:00] <raevynskkyyemt> Hi Emanon
[01:47:00] <Quadpod88> it's an interesting subject, but i get called a "stupid anglo" and it usually settles it
[01:47:01] <Emanon> hai
[01:47:09] <Neymei> Nice to meet you. :)
[01:47:19] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, 6 foot horns, and size of small elephant
[01:47:37] <Quadpod88> so awesome
[01:47:51] <Hrafnbjorn> aurochs is the simple meaning of one of the runes too
[01:48:18] <Hrafnbjorn> although the detailed meaning is the middle ground, and interaction of the wild and domestic
[01:48:21] <Quadpod88> never looked into it
[01:48:40] <Hrafnbjorn> it is the ur/uruz runne
[01:48:58] <Quadpod88> nice
[01:49:58] <Quadpod88> i remember you talking about it, well not the auroch angle
[01:50:44] <SpiritSong> talking runes?
[01:50:47] <raevynskkyyemt> I've never heard the word. But if it's pronounced urock instead of awerock it makes sense

[01:52:59] <raevynskkyyemt> Like I said. I've only ever seen auroch in print. Never spoken 
[01:53:06] <Quadpod88> i'm thinking this topic is turning more satire
[01:53:11] <Hrafnbjorn> been well thanks, you?
[01:53:20] <EronGari> there is potential for that

[01:54:03] <Love> 4I've been ok Hrafnbjorn, Thanks for asking.
[01:54:11] <Quadpod88> i've heard it pronounced or-rock in final fantasy
[01:54:48] <Love> 4Thanks SpiritSong ðŸ˜€
[01:55:06] * SpiritSong hugs lovr
[01:55:07] <Hrafnbjorn> 'och' is typical for Germanic language to mean bovines... such as with muskochs
[01:55:10] <SpiritSong> love
[01:55:16] <Hrafnbjorn> and were he modern 'ox' comes from
[01:55:47] <Quadpod88> i've heard something like that

[01:55:56] <EronGari> a lot of liberties were taken with modernizing English
[01:56:00] <Hrafnbjorn> so aurochs could mean 'golden ox' or even 'primal ox'

[02:17:26] <raevynskkyyemt> I like apocalypse books. I think I'd like the new division gsme
[02:17:34] <raevynskkyyemt> Too expensive right now though
[02:17:42] <Quadpod88> rainbow six wasn't supposed to be like rainbow six
[02:17:46] <Hrafnbjorn> Rainbow 6 Vegas 2 was a good game

[02:18:16] <EronGari> not sure I've played computer games since Space  Quest or Leisure Suit in the Land of the Lounge Lizards
[02:18:17] <DawnBat> you people and your fancy schamncy gaming
[02:19:13] <Hrafnbjorn> been trying to get a d&d game (here in irc) going for a long time, but never any luck
[02:19:22] <Quadpod88> DawnBat: you're the biggest gamer here
[02:19:24] <EronGari> that was the 80's, pre-internet stuff   Sierra Adventure games - upping Zork by the addition of graphics
[02:19:54] <raevynskkyyemt> One of the first games I ever played was in dos on a floppy disk
[02:20:11] <DawnBat> Quad : I play on a potato
[02:20:23] <Quadpod88> i'm not big on the new battlefront either
[02:20:25] <EronGari> yes - so nice whenI got my super XT witha HARD DRIVE!!
[02:20:27] <raevynskkyyemt> It was a castle. You had to find a way out. Everything was made up using ASCII characters. Even walls
[02:21:01] <DawnBat> Quad : I have Battlefront II :D
[02:21:13] <Quadpod88> i remember floppies
[02:21:23] <EronGari> no Windows - customized COLORED DOS by using ansi escape sequences
[02:21:26] <EronGari> fancy stuff
[02:21:39] <Quadpod88> oregon trail ftw
[02:22:08] <raevynskkyyemt> The other was an education game. Alf taught me math
[02:22:21] <raevynskkyyemt> Or at least tried. I'm not good at math
[02:22:24] <EronGari> except my first monitor was amber monochrome

[02:24:43] <DawnBat> nah
[02:24:47] <DawnBat> It's a cheat code for a game
[02:25:11] <EronGari> getting the idea there are others than me here who played their first vidwo games with Pong and were jazzed how much fun Space Invaders was...  then Pac-Man revolutionized the industry
[02:25:43] <Hrafnbjorn> lol, I remember my first Atari

[02:25:50] <EronGari> lol   yeah

[02:26:52] <raevynskkyyemt> Didn't have Atari. But I did have an NES. Must have been a first or second year release
[02:27:14] <EronGari> I had to go visit friends to play with their Commodore 64
[02:27:16] <DawnBat> psssstg
[02:27:32] <Quadpod88> i played castle wolfenstein and doom
[02:27:34] <DawnBat> "nothing says I love you like 50 shades and chill"
[02:27:34] <Hrafnbjorn> game consoles have sure come a long way since the 80's

[02:37:48] <Quadpod88> yeah, not old enough for foot switches being part of the job
[02:38:46] <EronGari> yeah, were foot switches to re-designate track and lock-on when the rest of your hands were too full
[02:39:47] <EronGari> but earlier on I used a photo tracking mount where the foot switches/pedals were for azimuth
[02:40:01] <Quadpod88> yeah, we don't generally switch targets once fired
[02:41:01] <EronGari> lucky you - I was on radio to the control room on the mainland and often told to switch tracks
[02:41:39] <Quadpod88> had manually run the fire direction though
[02:41:55] <EronGari> or when the shooters were in a gaggle and changed direction I had to stay on the lead plane, and they would get mixed around with their turns

[02:50:23] <Hrafnbjorn> I could, yeah, just angry that they didnt warn me it was a comic version of the novel... so now I have to go buy the novel still

[02:53:11] <Quadpod88> wendy's sounds good
[02:53:55] <EronGari> about the worst I saw, only fatalities - 2 - was a tug that went under in about 90 seconds after its hull ripped open on the stern plane of a sub transferring a crew member off that was being discharged
[02:54:26] <Quadpod88> i think i'd like a change in topic

[03:00:14] <Quadpod88> was he a roman merc?
[03:00:28] <Hrafnbjorn> he was for a while, yeah
[03:00:52] <Quadpod88> i think a saw a special on him, but it's been a while
[03:01:11] <Hrafnbjorn> his strategy, which he shoulda known better, was to hide in a walled town, so Rome just built a wall around their wall, and waited him out
[03:01:16] <Quadpod88> wiped out 3 legions?
[03:01:25] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah
[03:01:31] <EronGari> wow
[03:01:32] <eeems> Magnentius?
[03:01:55] <Quadpod88> i thought he fought them in the forest?

[03:03:25] <Hrafnbjorn> he fought small groups in the forest, but then fled to Alesia (not sure if thats spelled right)... you may also be thinking about Arminius, who was Germanic, and later

[03:09:45] <Hrafnbjorn> Rome was a vile beast
[03:10:04] <Quadpod88> they were
[03:10:13] <eeems> It didn't help that Rome increasingly made it extraordinarily difficult to survive to receive a diploma in the lands they conquered. In general, their culture became more inward facing and exclusive, and could no longer embrace the lands they conquered as truly Roman. And so, they went from builders and bringers of order to oppressive conquerors. 
[03:11:01] <Hrafnbjorn> one of the legions got the snot kicked out of them by some Chinese soldiers

[03:19:18] <Quadpod88> still, makes think there was more to it
[03:20:03] <Hrafnbjorn> Rome was already fairly weak by then though, so I wonder if there was some conspiracy that isnt part of the wrotten history now, by some Roman senators or something with the Pictish Scots
[03:20:16] <Hrafnbjorn> *written
[03:20:42] <Quadpod88> are there books on it?
[03:21:09] <Hrafnbjorn> theres obviously hidden aspects, cause there is no major military effort without the use of spies, but we never hear about that side
[03:21:35] <ForestFox> Hi
[03:21:35] <Hrafnbjorn> It is mentioned in several books, dunno if there are books about it specificaly though
[03:21:48] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa ForestFox, how are you?
[03:21:56] <MissSugar> hey ForestFox 
[03:22:05] <ForestFox> Hey Hrafnbjorn, im good, yourself? Hi MissSugar 
[03:22:23] <Hrafnbjorn> am well thanks
[03:22:50] <Hrafnbjorn> MissSugar, I have an issue with the novel you suggested!!! I bought it on kindle, and it was a comic book!
[03:22:59] <MissSugar> which book?
[03:23:17] <North> ForestFox, is your usual nick some other fox-related thing I can't recall off the top of my head?
[03:23:24] <Hrafnbjorn> only difference I could find is that the actualk novel is more expenssive for kindle than print (6.99)
[03:23:38] <ForestFox> I usually go by Zallikex
[03:23:43] <North> aha
[03:23:46] <Hrafnbjorn> the Mercy Thompson book
[03:23:52] <MissSugar> whats the title?
[03:24:01] <Quadpod88> i like books
[03:24:01] <Hrafnbjorn> hold on
[03:24:15] <Quadpod88> kindle is only temp
[03:24:36] <Hrafnbjorn> I like kindle for fiction, but not for stuff I am trying to learn from
[03:24:52] <MissSugar> because i dont think i have heard of Mercy Thompson
[03:25:08] <Hrafnbjorn> "Moon Called"
[03:25:23] <MissSugar> i have never heard of that book
[03:25:28] <raevynskkyyemt> I like my kindle. But I've been listening to audio books more than print lalely
[03:25:47] <raevynskkyyemt> So I use my phone
[03:26:28] <Hrafnbjorn> both the comic and the novel have the same cover, both called Patricia Briggs's Mercy Thompson
[03:26:38] <Quadpod88> i like to follow along with the audio book, especially when i'm driving
[03:27:07] <MissSugar> i dont think that was the book i recommended, because i have never read her stuff
[03:27:12] <MissSugar> tell me if its any good
[03:27:12] <raevynskkyyemt> I can listen while I'm cleaning. Or while I'm playing games 
[03:27:30] <Quadpod88> seriously, that was funny
[03:27:35] <raevynskkyyemt> I like the mercy thompson series
[03:27:54] <Hrafnbjorn> yu and Archr were discussing it... I had to check lods to get the title
[03:27:58] <Hrafnbjorn> *you
[03:28:17] <Hrafnbjorn> *logs
[03:28:34] <MissSugar> weird
[03:28:52] <Hrafnbjorn> not important though, lol
[03:29:15] <MissSugar> well i do have short term memory loss 
[03:29:25] * Quadpod88 sheds a tear
[03:29:27] <MissSugar> so getting something out of me that i discussed days ago would be impossible
[03:30:21] <MissSugar> i would be a terrible spy
[03:30:23] <Hrafnbjorn> I bought a bunch of books today, but that was the only fiction one
[03:30:37] <Quadpod88> :(
[03:30:40] <raevynskkyyemt> You can return Kindle books
[03:30:51] <EronGari> for a few years working on the island I drove to work once a week, stayed in the barracks, and had a 3-hour commute - so audio books got popular with me then
[03:30:59] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, I will have to look into that
[03:31:13] <raevynskkyyemt> One of the options is accidental purchase
[03:31:49] <raevynskkyyemt> In my account look under digital orders
[03:32:00] <Hrafnbjorn> groovy, thanks
[03:32:16] <EronGari> fiction is fine, schi-fi ala Philip K Dick for instance
[03:32:32] <raevynskkyyemt> I had to return one last week. Accidently purchased for myself instead of for a gift
[03:32:43] <raevynskkyyemt> Yw hraf
[03:32:54] <Hrafnbjorn> I have a hard time with fiction, just doesnt hold my attention like it should
[03:32:56] <MissSugar> lol in fact every time i do a reading and someone comes back and is like "remember that prediction?" "Nope"
[03:33:48] <raevynskkyyemt> I'm listening to a Sci first book now actually
[03:34:07] <raevynskkyyemt> Sci fi
[03:34:23] <EronGari> was trying to eat a donut with my tea but my dog was demanding I share it - I get the icing part and he got the bottom plain part
[03:35:13] <EronGari> and he wants more but it is gone now
[03:36:07] <North> so sorry, poochie...there is no more donut for you
[03:36:09] <EronGari> pugs are very friendly and loving, but they are demanding and wilful
[03:36:12] <North> ONLY DESPAIR
[03:36:20] <raevynskkyyemt> Lol North 
[03:36:52] <Hrafnbjorn> thanks raevynskkyyemt... I had no clue ya could get refunds for kindle books :)

[03:38:47] <EronGari> my pug is like the ones bred 100 years ago, he doesn't have the smooshie face but a wrinkled snout and sculptured body - my wife's pug female has a body shaped like a watermelon

[03:40:43] <EronGari> I didn't want another one - I hate the loss, but  my wife bought him and gave him to me then got herself a female - I am old enough now the dog will probably outlive me - if he stays off the donuts
[03:41:00] <raevynskkyyemt> My last dog had a bad habit of sleeping in the middle of the floor. Almost broke my nose because of it
[03:41:10] <North> yikes
[03:41:21] <raevynskkyyemt> ND 
[03:41:35] <EronGari> nope, my dog sleeps on my bed and tries to push me off it

[03:52:59] <Edward> A few hours, heh
[03:53:29] <EronGari> yeah, then I had to pack my clothes and head over to the casita, so got to sleep after midnight finally

[03:58:21] <EronGari> Mom would not part with hers even for a run to the store
[03:58:41] <EronGari> she insisted on driving me, and griping now and then

[03:58:52] <EronGari> but was mostly amiable

[04:02:12] <EronGari> not sure when I first injured those ribs but for many years I can remember I keep re-injuring them

[04:03:05] <EronGari> at least they didn't bother me until after I was done with the ,moving

[04:06:38] <Edward> I personally think you might have taken it a little too seriously.

[04:22:09] <EronGari> Poog has been eating well - my tastes are not right, most stuff doesn't taste right still - I cooked a pork steak just now and he will get most - Jello and sweets are the onloy things that taste like they should to me - it is a wonder I shared my donut wit him
[04:22:44] <Edward> I had meatloaf today

[04:23:39] <Edward> Did you ever get it?
[04:23:57] <EronGari> I did manage to enjoy a pastrami8 sandwich, which was more a priority - no, didn't get the meat loaf
[04:24:50] <EronGari> I used very little salt on the pork and it tastes too salty
[04:25:12] <Edward> Hmm
[04:25:38] <EronGari> next time I'll cook with none at all
[04:25:38] <Hrafnbjorn> I put honey and rosemary on any pork I make
[04:26:14] <Edward> Honey and rosemary .... aww man you guys are making me hungry
[04:26:24] <EronGari> it happened to the chicken breasts I fixed at my mom's house also - too salty and used very little in the cooking process
[04:26:55] <EronGari> oh, good stuff - I don't have any rosemary at the casita right now
[04:27:06] <Hrafnbjorn> WHAT!!!

[04:49:43] <EronGari> but I was seriously sick enough to warrant it
[04:51:49] <EronGari> in Morelia (Mexico) I first went to the ticket counter and they sent me to immigrations first, then immigrations sent me back to the ticket counter - then I told them I requested assistance, and the rest went smooth as snot
[04:52:00] <EronGari> slicker than...
[04:52:57] <EronGari> I may use it again if I travel, even if I feel better then - don't want a relapse

[04:53:58] <raevynskkyyemt> Hi
[04:54:08] <Keith> howdy raevynskkyyemt
[04:54:23] <EronGari> was worth giving a $20 tip to the guy pushing me around
[04:54:23] <Keith> how is y'all
[04:55:47] <MissSugar> hey Keith
[04:55:51] <raevynskkyyemt> Alright. You? 
[04:57:15] <Keith> hey there MissSugar
[04:57:27] <Keith> I am well thanks raevynskkyyemt.  a bit tired.  but ok :)
[04:58:04] <EronGari> airlines are getting chincy these days - it was a low rate, no frills, but if you wanted coffe or anything on the plane you had to buy it - dinner used to be a comp
[04:58:10] <Hrafnbjorn> wow, just saw a comercial for a Dr. Strange movie :)
[04:58:13] <EronGari> part of the ticket price
[04:59:22] <raevynskkyyemt> Benedict Cumberbatch is playing doctor strange hraf
[04:59:32] <Hrafnbjorn> yep
[04:59:41] <EronGari> I missed a lot of good movies being down here - not new now but saw parts on YouTube - anyone wee Warm Bodies?    Zombies recovering back to the living
[04:59:56] <raevynskkyyemt> I skipped that one eron
[05:00:00] <EronGari> see*
[05:00:11] <Hrafnbjorn> um, if its a few years old I thin I saw it, yeah
[05:00:15] <Keith> I cant wait to see Doctor Strange
[05:00:32] <EronGari> looked interesting to me, a different twist - otherwise not really into the zombie thing myself
[05:02:15] <raevynskkyyemt> I like zombies. But this seemed more like a romance. I'd rather have the hlror
[05:02:19] <raevynskkyyemt> Horror
[05:02:23] <Hrafnbjorn> I like zombie movies
[05:02:32] <EronGari> a teenage zombie meets a living girl and doesn't eat her, protects her instead, which starts a friendship and love brings him back into the living, slowly - the girl's father shoots him and he bleeds, proving he is no longer dead
[05:04:00] <Hrafnbjorn> oh poo, I was watching news, and I guess lions are attacking folk so much in India right now, that they think there may be a new type of rabies going around :(
[05:04:13] <EronGari> I dunno, guss I am turning soft in my old age - a little romance is a sweet memory - my dog is my best friend these days - wife just has me around for looks, I think
[05:05:00] <EronGari> her gringo trophy husband
[05:05:05] <Hrafnbjorn> I seem to remember that yes there was romance in that movie, it was more about the zombies trials in getting back to a somewhat normal state of being
[05:06:30] <EronGari> yeah, that was more to the point of it, but romance helped start the turn back - what I saw of it was funny, seeing the zombies try to make sense of what was happening to them and losing memory of what living was like
[05:06:55] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[05:07:06] <EronGari> then when they did return to life it was a slow process learning how to live again
[05:07:15] <EronGari> funny stuff, really
[05:07:57] <EronGari> well, I want to see it all now, what I saw of it was interesting
[05:08:15] <raevynskkyyemt> Might be on Netflix by now

[05:11:40] <Eighteenboy> wow, its been a long time
[05:11:53] <EronGari> at least upi suspect Canada - others think Mexico is trying to take over
[05:12:00] <Hrafnbjorn> whats your question Eighteenboy?
[05:12:03] <EronGari> you*
[05:12:20] <Eighteenboy> Are you guys actually magicians? like actual spells and stuff
[05:12:31] <Eighteenboy> I mean everyone knows magic does not exist

[05:54:13] <Hrafnbjorn> we could discuss the Alcis paradigm?
[05:55:51] <Hrafnbjorn> or not
[05:56:13] * Hrafnbjorn changes room name to #zombie.shuffle
[05:56:19] <MissSugar> i dont know what that is
[05:57:17] <Hrafnbjorn> Alcis is the concept of the twin deities, and also appeared in Greek humanity in form of all the Cleopatra's.... usually the twins are married
[05:57:44] <Hrafnbjorn> the name Alcis is specific to a proto-Germanic pair, but also aplied to the concept aside from just them
[05:58:06] <MissSugar> ohhh ok
[05:58:27] <Hrafnbjorn> I think about it often... things like why, and why is it so widespread in Indo-European civilization
[05:58:45] <MissSugar> twins are often a common theme representing the duality of humans and the balance between the male and female 
[05:59:03] <Chiaro> like the good twin and the evil twin?
[05:59:07] <Hrafnbjorn> Heathenism has a few versions... Freyr and Freya, Njord and Nerthus, Ziu and Zisa
[05:59:26] <MissSugar> in Voodoo there are the Marassa 
[05:59:29] <Hrafnbjorn> no they werent usually good and evil, although some could say the last Cleopatra bordered on evil

[06:00:46] <Hrafnbjorn> do yu think it represents that gender balance, or does it go beyond that into the duality creating the myriad
[06:01:37] <Hrafnbjorn> in Taoism they have the belief that there is the 'one chi' which becomes the yin-yang (comparable to the Alcis?), which becomes the 5-elements, which becomes all possible things
[06:01:45] <MissSugar> i think that the gender aspect is deeper than most practitioners give it credit
[06:01:52] <raevynskkyyemt> Maybe it's because they represent humanity. We imagine them in our image. Twins are common enough that they would be included 
[06:02:11] <Chiaro> Romulus & Remus
[06:02:20] <Hrafnbjorn> so, if it is an iinteraction between the duality, whether deity, or yin-yang that creates, is it really a duality, or is it triple?
[06:02:38] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, perhaps
[06:04:11] <Keith> raevynskkyyemt, you working tongiht??
[06:04:13] <Chiaro> Once you have two, then you can begat multiplicity
[06:04:59] <raevynskkyyemt> Yes. But so far it's slow Keith 
[06:05:07] <Hrafnbjorn> I wonder if the commonality of birthing twins gave borth to the Alcos concept... seeing as how if a couple has twins once, they are more likely than other to have twins again, so perhaps folk observed how certsain families gave birth to twins at uncommon rates, and thought there was someing special goin on
[06:05:32] <raevynskkyyemt> Maybe in prehistory twins were sacred
[06:05:47] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[06:05:47] <raevynskkyyemt> Especially identical ones
[06:05:53] <Keith> raevynskkyyemt well how do they expect your night to pass by if it is so slow?? :(
[06:06:12] <raevynskkyyemt> Well I am watching force awakens again 
[06:06:22] <Keith> an over rated movie in my opinion
[06:06:37] <Keith> so is dawn of justice
[06:06:49] <Chiaro> What did the Zen master say to the hot dog vendor?
[06:06:52] <raevynskkyyemt> Haven't seen dawn of justice
[06:06:58] <Hrafnbjorn> with other animals, when they give birth to multiples, there is usualy one that gets all the bad genes, so I see a utilitarian aspect in nature, but humans seem exempt from that natural tendancy
[06:07:33] <Keith> i would advise against it. most people weren't pleased with it.  and i am saddened by it
[06:07:47] <Keith> they are trying for too much to quick
[06:07:55] <raevynskkyyemt> I put force awakens between the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. Ot being the best and pt being the worst
[06:08:04] <Hrafnbjorn> I wouold see it for Wonder Woman ;)

[06:08:21] <Keith> Hrafnbjorn you dont see her for that much of it
[06:08:32] <Hrafnbjorn> unfortunate
[06:08:39] <Keith> i suppose
[06:08:41] <Hrafnbjorn> that actress is a bad ass though, lol
[06:08:53] <Hrafnbjorn> she was a combat instructor for the IDF
[06:09:09] <Keith> wonder woman?
[06:09:14] <Keith> ohhhh
[06:09:24] <Hrafnbjorn> the actress that plays her in the movie, yeah

[07:32:25] <Abraxas> Welcome, eeems. Only one thing registers on the subconscious mind: repetitive application. Practice. What you practice is what you manifest.
[07:34:48] <raevynskyyemt> Hraf have you seen turn? 
[07:35:08] <Hrafnbjorn> doesnt sound familiar
[07:35:30] <raevynskyyemt> You like history so I thought it would be up your alley 
[07:35:30] <Hrafnbjorn> what is it?
[07:36:02] <raevynskyyemt> It's about the American Revolution. Washington creates a spy ring
[07:36:29] <Hrafnbjorn> groovy... I like spy stuff too, so thats two +'s
[07:37:05] <Hrafnbjorn> although most of my study about spy stuff is from the Asian countries
[07:37:08] <raevynskyyemt> Season 3 just started on AMC. But the first two seasons are on Netflix
[07:37:24] <raevynskyyemt> Inhave no idea how accurate it is. But I like ir
[07:37:26] <raevynskyyemt> It
[07:37:40] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, I wonder if its out on bluray yet
[07:38:25] <raevynskyyemt> I don't know. I don't buy physical media anymore. But if it's on Netflix there's a good chance it's on bluray
[07:38:57] <Hrafnbjorn> I would stream everything if only my connection allowed it
[07:39:41] <Hrafnbjorn> I have stolen a lot of movis and series off youtube though...  I have to download them when I am at work though, which only happens once a month or so
[07:40:47] <Hrafnbjorn> American history is a weak area of history for me... never really got into it much
[07:41:40] <Hrafnbjorn> I have read that Washington made extensive use of spies though, so that show doesnt sound far fetched
[07:42:28] <raevynskyyemt> I prefer 1000 years ago or more for my history. My bad memory makes it an adventure at times
[07:43:26] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, my main interest is around 1000 years or more, except Japanese history, which I enjoy studying up to the 1800's
[07:44:48] <eeems> Can always just watch it unfold over and over again. The window shades change, but the view doesn't. At least not often.
[07:44:58] <Hrafnbjorn> Japan hardly changed from 300's to 1800's though, so it makes it a bit hard cause often you can file the info away according to cultural change... when its that long with little change, it makes it hard to keep a time-line in you minds eye
[07:45:18] <raevynskyyemt> Yeah
[07:46:44] <Hrafnbjorn> I like the amount of litterature left from feudal Japan though... it makes it nice to read the words of folk that lived it rather than academics writing about what the evidence suggests
[07:47:41] <Hrafnbjorn> there are hundreds of books written by samurai... some mainstream samurai stuff, some shinobi stuff.  So you get a good picture of what pre-western culture was like there
[07:48:15] <Hrafnbjorn> the shinobi stuff is fascinating, but at times gets a bot gross too
[07:49:00] <raevynskyyemt> Detailed? 
[07:49:44] <Hrafnbjorn> it gets into the magic they used, which involved a lot of dog parts... plus theres a lot of animal poo in some of their kajutsu (fire-techniques) recipes
[07:50:27] <raevynskyyemt> Yuck

[07:52:17] <Hrafnbjorn> one, which is for evading the detection from guard dogs is to find 2 mating dogs, kill them while still 'connected' and remove the reproductive organs... dry them in the sun for a while, then bury them fo a while, then turn it into a powder... never says just what to do with the powder though

[16:44:25] <SpiritSong> how do?
[16:44:45] <SpiritSong> its only computer generated, so no need to take it as true :)
[16:45:13] <Quadpod88> probly cause i did it when i was depressed, and it made me feel worse

[16:45:51] <Quadpod88> i will success in my nonexistant career

[16:51:09] <Quadpod88> Present, Four Cups
[16:51:10] <Quadpod88> You feel low right now, apathetic, washed out and even hurt. But you don't have to feel like this, past events were not your fault. Time to grit your teeth, move forward, and wow the world again - you can do it.
[16:51:29] <Quadpod88> it gets better

[19:53:16] <Hrafnbjorn> they are an easy target
[19:53:45] <eeems> There's something almost apophatic at being contrarian towards him\her\it.

[20:16:45] <Hrafnbjorn> well isnt that special, lol
[20:18:01] <meeb> Look, I'll probably be dead in a year or two. A little salty language is meager trivia.
[20:18:47] <Hrafnbjorn> I cannot disagree that 'salty' labuage is trivial
[20:19:01] <Hrafnbjorn> *language
[20:20:20] <Hrafnbjorn> especialy seeing as how most of English's swear words are only profane BECAUSE they are English, or Old Norse
[20:20:59] <Hrafnbjorn> ass for example is the English word for 'a god'
[20:21:21] <meeb> Or it could be referring to a donkey.
[20:21:49] <Hrafnbjorn> it does now, yeah, but thats a recent addition
[20:22:03] <meeb> The pin around which a wheel rotates. The axis mundi. :D
[20:22:30] <meeb> It's a fine enough concept for a divine entity.
[20:22:50] <H-> ass?
[20:23:00] <H-> ;)
[20:23:30] <meeb> Well, there's a reason so many churches were built atop (or sometimes functioned as) brothels... ;)
[20:24:11] <Hrafnbjorn> the word originated as a Saxon/Dansk word to refer to the folk that settled the Baltic coast, and established the Germanic cuture... the Greeks called them Aes (people of iron)
[20:24:32] <Hrafnbjorn> later they would be called Aesir
[20:24:59] <meeb> Yes, but "ass" specifically, is saxon for the center of something, which is moving around it.
[20:25:16] <AllisonWonderland> I wish I could drop the f bomb :(
[20:25:29] <H-> funny that, people of iron, makes you woned about the whole concept of " god " or divine
[20:25:42] <H-> woned=wonder
[20:25:46] <AllisonWonderland> It's such a beautifully diverse word
[20:26:43] <Hrafnbjorn> not exactly, that was aesis
[20:26:55] <meeb> Been poking through enough old documents to have picked up a little of the language.
[20:26:56] <Hrafnbjorn> or yrmin
[20:27:04] <H-> the dutch word for axis is as though, not ass ;)
[20:27:09] <meeb> Though I certainly wouldn't claim to speak it.

[20:34:53] <AllisonWonderland> like a tree of life image? or like a yggdrasil image?
[20:34:55] <AllisonWonderland> yeah
[20:34:58] <AllisonWonderland> just go with spirals

[20:35:17] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, like a yggdrasil
[20:36:04] <Hrafnbjorn> spirals, in heathenism represent wells though, so its appropriate... doesil for clockwise, inward... widdershins for counterclockwise, outward

[20:50:49] <Hrafnbjorn> I try to teach about runes and seidh as well, but not much interest these days in traditiional runology or seidh
[20:50:58] <H-> what style ?
[20:52:01] <Hrafnbjorn> depends on the person... mostly I teach Kosho Ryu, and Yagyu Ryu... but for some folk I will teach escrima or a couple of the Chinese wu-shu
[20:52:36] * H- wishes he knew a LOT more about the subject
[20:52:48] <H-> my lack of knowledge in that areas is astronomical
[20:53:15] <H-> I only like the defensive ones... or are they all defensive ? not sure
[20:53:50] <AllisonWonderland> lol H- of course I'm a woman :P
[20:54:03] <Hrafnbjorn> they are all both defensive and offensive... some just focus more on the yin than the yang

[20:55:17] <AllisonWonderland> I'm not a vampire
[20:55:36] <Hrafnbjorn> but they all have yin and yang aspects... or in some cases, such as Kosho Ryu they break it down as onno atemi waza (female striking tricks) or otoku atemi waza (male striking tricks)
[20:55:42] <H-> and you also claim not to be a man ;)
[20:55:51] <meeb> Agreed. I had fun with a few people I met from dating sites, but no one I wanted to settle down with. I'm glad to be married now. Though we're open-ish, neither of us seems to have much interest in anyone else these days.

[20:57:00] <H-> don't mind me, I'm tired, I get talkishy
[20:57:15] <meeb> Plenty of trans guys without schlongs. Plenty of trans women with. Plenty of intersex people too.
[20:57:16] <AllisonWonderland> ffs
[20:57:29] <H-> AH! shemale then
[20:57:34] <AllisonWonderland> I was born female, I am female, I will always be female
[20:57:42] <AllisonWonderland> even if I'm on the internet
[20:58:31] <meeb> Likewise. Though I was born genetically intersex, and raised male. It did not make for a happy childhood, and I was essentially robbed of my girlhood. Alas. That's how life is sometimes.
[20:58:52] * AllisonWonderland blinkblinks
[20:58:59] <AllisonWonderland> that escalated quickly
[20:59:18] * meeb shrugs.
[20:59:23] <AllisonWonderland> I didn't want my girlhood tbh
[20:59:39] <AllisonWonderland> I didn't want makeup and frilly dresses and precious knick knacks
[20:59:57] <AllisonWonderland> I was always out trompin round the woods with my slingshot and books

[21:00:10] <AllisonWonderland> when I got older I started draggin my bb gun around :D
[21:00:55] <H-> I guess people still can't except individual uniqueness eh? shame really
[21:01:05] <H-> accept.. my god my typing gets worse

[21:02:19] * Hrafnbjorn smacks connection for being jealous at me looking at AllisonWonderland's photos
[21:03:14] <AllisonWonderland> That sounds great meeb! I grew into appreciating the long, flowy hippy skirts and how great my legs look in em ;)
[21:03:26] <AllisonWonderland> lol Hrafnbjorn
[21:04:55] <Hrafnbjorn> hippy skirts look great on women IMO... I also like the baggy straight legged pants that look almost like a skirt (hope that makes sense)
[21:05:10] <H-> nope, not to me
[21:05:17] <H-> don't worry, not many things do these days
[21:06:16] <Hrafnbjorn> I dunno how else to explain it... lots of the dancers at the dance school I used to drum for wore them

[21:07:51] <meeb> Honestly? I'm occasionally glad for my upbringing. A lot of women are slowly trained to feeling less capable than they are growing up. I don't think that would've necessarily been the case with me, mom being a programmer and all, but there's still so many outside sources reinforcing these old notions of what women should and shouldn't do that it's impossible to say. I would've
[21:07:52] <meeb> been different, that's certain. Just not sure how.
[21:08:01] <H-> once again it prooved to be too much for poor Hraf's connection

[21:09:52] <AllisonWonderland> and the mug hits your front tooth
[21:09:57] <meeb> Ow!
[21:10:00] <AllisonWonderland> and not only does that hurt like hell
[21:10:07] <H-> oh yeah I have that with beer occasionally
[21:10:24] <AllisonWonderland> but you spill approx. half a cup of hot coffee down your shirt

[21:16:28] <meeb> It's Denver. We have rock shows several times a year.
[21:16:44] <H-> rock show ?
[21:16:54] <meeb> Yes, in the geological sense, not musical.
[21:17:01] <H-> (we don't have anything like it where I live)
[21:17:05] <H-> yeah I figured :D
[21:17:08] <meeb> Though I am about 15 minutes from Red Rocks. :D

[21:18:36] <meeb> It's 23 C out there today. Tomorrow it'll be below 0 and blizzarding. Yay Colorado! I've missed being on such a powerful circuit. :D
[21:19:13] <AllisonWonderland> ffffff
[21:19:42] <AllisonWonderland> my browser is effin up, can't see where I'm typing x.x
[21:19:53] <H-> install a better one then
[21:20:08] <H-> * typical IT guy sollution *
[21:20:19] <AllisonWonderland> gah, I can't, it's better now tho
[21:20:36] <AllisonWonderland> work computer you see? don't have admin passwords, you seeee?
[21:20:43] <H-> must hack you see ?
[21:20:47] <H-> ahw yiss
[21:20:52] <H-> motha f*ckin hacks
[21:20:54] <meeb> It's fun to watch the drama unfold over the front range. We're right on the edge of it, and it's a 5 minute walk to a wonderful view of the flatirons (though it's in the middle of a coyote habitat, so come respectful).
[21:22:37] <H-> I just looked up the song whiskey hangover by godsmack and typed whiskey in the searchbar.. first result: whiskeydick
[21:22:39] <H-> right
[21:22:44] <H-> today is NOT a good day
[21:25:17] <meeb> Download the installer for virtualbox. Reboot into safe mode, and install. Download roms for the linux or other OS of choice and install them in a virtual machine. Privacy, and admin rights within your new sandbox, achieved, especially if you also encrypt the image file for the virtual OS, assuming they're not running keyloggers on the host OS.
[21:25:44] <H-> meeb: Linux, good choice
[21:26:04] <H-> damn cat tries to steal beer again
[21:26:52] <meeb> And security can't really even bitch, because it's not really possible for the virtual OS to damage the host, short of some targeted, bespoke 0 day sploit, as long as you're updating virtualbox..
[21:27:20] <H-> just delete windows I'd say
[21:27:27] <H-> kill it with fire and install a proper OS
[21:27:37] <H-> BUT thats a whole different discussion
[21:29:03] <H-> now my other cat joins in to steal my beer...
[21:29:33] <meeb> Windows just presents a larger attack surface than any other OS. Exploiting it is more widely understood.
[21:29:49] <H-> ah, someone is forgetting servers it seems ;)
[21:30:50] <meeb> No, just stating a fact. *n?x is certainly more prevalent on servers. And then there's IOS (not the mobile kind)...
[21:31:04] <H-> true ;)

[22:53:01] <AllisonWonderland> lmfao
[22:53:30] <AllisonWonderland> so... the socially awkward handy man who lives on site here at the hotel (I'm at work btw) just came in and struck up a conversation
[22:53:47] <H-> at work ? its 10:52 pm here
[22:54:11] <AllisonWonderland> and we are chatting about wood working and natural crafting gates and entryways out of vines and saplings and stuff like that
[22:54:13] <H-> I have a socially awkward friend.. I just imagined him talking to a woman.. haha.. it was terrible
[22:54:26] <AllisonWonderland> lol it's just onto 5pm here
[22:54:31] <H-> :O
[22:55:05] <AllisonWonderland> and we got to talking about my hometown in the next town over and he asked if I graduated from the high school there and I said yes and threw in that I graduated in 2010
[22:55:30] <AllisonWonderland> and he just covers his mouth, giggles, says "Oh my gosh you are just a baby!" and walks out of the office
[22:55:32] <AllisonWonderland> thanks guy.
[22:55:34] <AllisonWonderland> thanks.
[22:55:57] <H-> hahahaha :D
[22:56:35] <H-> I have no idea of the average age to graduate over there though
[22:56:42] <AllisonWonderland> btw I turn 24 next month, I don't really think that makes me a baby D:<
[22:56:54] <AllisonWonderland> 18ish H-
[22:57:08] <H-> ah ok :)
[22:57:17] <EronGari> depends on what age you start to consider 'old'
[22:57:26] <H-> meh old is relative ;)
[22:57:45] <EronGari> unless you have no living relatives left
[22:58:08] <H-> well that depends tbh :p
[22:58:57] <EronGari> but if old is relative then so is young - we're all in this together, and no one here gets out alive
[22:59:08] <AllisonWonderland> EronGari: long time no chat! :)
[22:59:19] <EronGari> yes, thought that was you
[22:59:27] <AllisonWonderland> aye, tis meh!

[23:05:31] * AllisonWonderland does teh flirteh eyes
[23:05:42] <AllisonWonderland> lulz
[23:05:59] <EronGari> not really, I just paid attention to details when I was IRCop
[23:06:08] <EronGari> I remember everything
[23:06:24] <AllisonWonderland> you know what
[23:06:30] <EronGari> probably
[23:06:34] <AllisonWonderland> I was just examining my thumbprints
[23:06:38] <AllisonWonderland> and as it turns out
[23:06:52] <AllisonWonderland> my right thumby has a spiral pattern
[23:06:54] <EronGari> you have a clone?
[23:07:03] <EronGari> ah, and left is a loop
[23:07:19] <AllisonWonderland> and the lefty thumby has a double spiral, much like starhawk's spiral dance
[23:07:35] <EronGari> oh, cool
[23:07:40] <EronGari> even better
[23:07:42] <AllisonWonderland> aye

[23:07:54] <AllisonWonderland> I've had too much coffee today
[23:08:27] <EronGari> my life story - I had too much of everything, and now...
[23:08:31] <AllisonWonderland> http://imgur.com/dZFUFex
[23:08:49] <AllisonWonderland> I want to IRCop there
[23:08:51] <AllisonWonderland> but I cannot
[23:09:05] <AllisonWonderland> modding from my phone is difficult as it is
[23:09:19] <AllisonWonderland> and I don't have a home computer
[23:09:58] <EronGari> opping is one thing, IRCop is that whole thing on steroids, and more
[23:10:21] <AllisonWonderland> which I would love to learn and commit my time and energy to doing but real life and stuffs
[23:11:39] <AllisonWonderland> brb
[23:11:42] <EronGari> I use an over-size monitor so I can keep about 8 screens up at once and a few more indicators on the rest I am not seeing - then everyone I didn't know I'd run their IP, and etcetera
[23:12:05] <AllisonWonderland> oh
[23:12:12] <EronGari> used*  that is  -  glad to not be doing that anymore - it was hectic
[23:12:22] <AllisonWonderland> I erm, do that on my phone, while I'm modding, I run EVERY IP I don't recognize
[23:13:01] <AllisonWonderland> hell, I even set up my own channel and added a bot one night on my phone XD
[23:13:05] <EronGari> yep, and that was just part of it all
[23:13:23] <AllisonWonderland> mhmm brb
[23:13:47] <EronGari> 'k

[23:15:34] <EronGari> still don't know what or where 'Wado' is from - no one to me
[23:15:47] <EronGari> new one*
[23:16:37] <H-> so.. you run IP's .. then what ?
[23:17:19] <EronGari> just keeping track of who was on our network when I was adminning it
[23:17:28] <H-> ah :)
[23:17:37] <H-> I'm just curious :)
[23:17:42] <EronGari> me too
[23:18:01] <EronGari> I was then, but don't 'have' to care now
[23:18:31] <H-> are IRC channels even active anymore?
[23:18:38] <EronGari> sure
[23:18:46] <EronGari> some
[23:18:58] <H-> hmm
[23:19:09] <EronGari> those with web sites that get them there
[23:19:59] <EronGari> the vast majority seem kinda dead though
[23:20:25] <H-> yeah, went through a few channels before I found this one
[23:20:38] <EronGari> nice to find an active place
[23:20:42] <H-> nothing but tumbleweed and crickets
[23:20:48] <H-> yeah it is
[23:21:24] <EronGari> but it can be deceptive, even the lively ones are dead sometimes
[23:23:07] <EronGari> even if 20 people are 'parked' on a channel it still can be dead for hours
[23:31:16] <H-> yeah
[23:31:21] <H-> just being idle
[23:31:38] * H- went out for a smoke
[23:32:12] <H-> or reading everything but never typing
[23:33:24] <AllisonWonderland> I hath return'd

[23:35:18] <H-> evidence denied, still a man

[23:40:56] <H-> cheat
[23:41:29] <EronGari> playing against a computer, it won't let me...
[23:41:31] <H-> I think I'm off to bed
[23:41:38] <H-> it's getting late
[23:41:44] <EronGari> but there are ways I make the losing games not count in my tally
[23:41:55] <AllisonWonderland> buhbai Helga, sweet dreams

[23:42:41] <H-> well cya

[23:42:51] <EronGari> Mexico time is still a quarter to 5, not even close to siesta time

[23:43:39] *** Quits: H- (ik@sorcery-926u53.direct-adsl.nl) (Quit: WeeChat 1.4)
[23:46:28] <EronGari> I am camping a few days at my 'casita' while the rest of the family moves to a new house - movers came today and moved the furniture but still a few days of getting the house ready before I join them
[23:47:36] <EronGari> got to build a 3rd baÃ±o for me yet so I can have my privacy
[23:47:37] <AllisonWonderland> I want to go camping
[23:47:41] <AllisonWonderland> right now
[23:48:36] <EronGari> I just got back from a week in the US, visiting with my mom, staying with her ,,,    so was not going to stay long
[23:49:29] <EronGari> visited a couple old friends but didn't have a car so California without wheels gets old quick
[23:51:02] <AllisonWonderland> I bet lol
[23:51:16] <AllisonWonderland> Anywhere without wheels gets old quickly
[23:51:22] <AllisonWonderland> except perhaps venice
[23:51:59] <EronGari> haven't had to deal with that for a long time - haven't left Mexico since 2007 and drove my SUV down here then
[23:53:02] <EronGari> yeah, but Venice was an hour away - was gong to stop at a couple places along the coast highway if I could, Neptune's Net by Trancas - I was a Malibu kid
[23:53:18] <EronGari> my mom lives in Camarillo
[23:53:40] <EronGari> made it to Oxnard to vist a couple friends though
[23:54:27] <AllisonWonderland> I meant Venice, Italy
[23:54:31] <EronGari> oh, Venice Italy?   Venice, 'muscle beach' is cool without wheels
[23:54:35] <AllisonWonderland> lol
[23:55:01] <EronGari> I forgot, other places have a Venice too
[23:55:26] <EronGari> but not the apartment building where Jim Morrison used to live
[23:55:36] <EronGari> with his mural painted on the side of it
[23:56:40] <EronGari> like I said, I was a California kid
[23:57:25] <EronGari> camping on the beach was not considered homeless when young
[23:57:49] <EronGari> probably is now though
[23:59:34] <AllisonWonderland> camping is camping
[23:59:51] <AllisonWonderland> whether on a beach or in the woods or onna mountain!
