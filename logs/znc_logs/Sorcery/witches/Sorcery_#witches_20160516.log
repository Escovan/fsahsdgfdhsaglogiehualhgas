[00:13:29] <BansheeTears> Itsy
[00:13:54] <BansheeTears> Too hot to leave the whole window open, so we fitted a cat door in
[00:14:01] <BansheeTears> He's terrified of it
[00:15:03] <North> maybe you could place a cat treat on the other side of the pet door, and then open the pet door, showing him the glorious reward on the other side

[00:16:49] <SpiritSong> lolol
[00:16:59] <BansheeTears> Gary got it fast
[00:17:13] <BansheeTears> We put another in the family room window
[00:17:14] <North> pretty soon he'll discover that being able to open a door is sort of like having a minor superpower
[00:17:37] <SpiritSong> lol yes xD
[00:17:40] <BansheeTears> It leads to the enclosed patio
[00:17:59] <BansheeTears> So outside is just a catflap away
[00:18:03] <SpiritSong> my mother had my dad build a cat run for minnie. she wants to be outside but its hot, so its got a roof to shade her
[00:18:11] <BansheeTears> Need more treats...
[00:18:15] <SpiritSong> she isnt going to like it or stay in it...its like a cage :/
[00:18:32] <BansheeTears> Baby loves her outside cage
[00:18:35] <SpiritSong> and yes...hot in ireland O_o
[00:18:42] <SpiritSong> is it big?
[00:19:07] <BansheeTears> Yup it's two utility shelves chicken wired together
[00:19:27] <North> <-- curl of blue smoke emerging from left ear, while attempting to reconcile 'hot' with 'Ireland'
[00:19:39] <BansheeTears> It's 4 levels and 5 ft long and 7 foot tall
[00:19:48] <SpiritSong> thats really cool
[00:20:11] <BansheeTears> She gets in through the window and out through a hole at the bottom
[00:20:11] <SpiritSong> i tried to tell my parents there needs to be levels for the cat to feel safe...and not bored. but they didnt listen to me
[00:20:25] <BansheeTears> She can get fresh air and still feel safe
[00:20:32] <SpiritSong> thats awesome
[00:20:41] <SpiritSong> can she get into it from the house?
[00:20:56] <BansheeTears> Yup and out if she wants into the yard
[00:21:06] <SpiritSong> thats awesome ^_^
[00:21:09] <BansheeTears> But we can close the bottom hole
[00:21:27] <BansheeTears> It keeps her safe from dogs in the hood

[00:27:16] <North> my cat was a big fan of that
[00:27:20] <SpiritSong> well she goes out anyways, this is mainly so she can be out and contained to a shady area

[02:38:16] <North> after putting in all that time
[02:38:52] <Witchit> Yeah :) I got the most commissions when I was starting out. I still get commissions, just from less people

[03:06:37] <North> ;)
[03:06:56] <Witchit> I mean, I've seen people use dirt or blood for paint
[03:07:17] <North> barbarians
[03:07:30] <Witchit> And honestly, I'd rather see that than someone sneeze on a canvas with food in their mouth and call it art
[03:07:54] <North> I seem to recall your outrage at something similar

[03:08:21] <Witchit> Definitely that
[03:08:22] <North> ah, right
[03:08:30] * North nods
[03:08:30] <Witchit> That's the biggest thing I rage at XD

[04:33:52] <MissSugar> if you keep gesturing vaguely your gonna knock stuff over

[04:51:59] <Jacinda> chicken pot pie?
[04:52:22] <SpiritSong> lol, i think you are the only person who gives out about the quotes who actually suggested alternative quotes
[04:52:37] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Good idea, MissSugar. Except, Abraxas might randomly keep repeating the same ones.
[04:52:53] <SpiritSong> nah just chicken
[04:52:56] <MissSugar> like the one about cutting roast beef with a screwdriver

[11:43:09] <Keith> at one point someone bound away my abilities.... i believe some still maybe.  but over time i managed to use the energy of the inding and used it to help in other situations :)
[11:43:21] <Aria> I've had that happen too....
[11:43:24] <Aria> It's very scary
[11:43:51] <Keith> I think it was also my rage that helped me break free.
[11:43:58] <Aria> My rage didn't help me
[11:44:01] <Aria> I felt helpless
[11:44:05] <Aria> I couldn't ground
[11:44:08] <Aria> I couldn't connect
[11:44:11] <Aria> I was cut off from the astral
[11:44:13] <Aria> it was horrible...
[11:44:14] <Keith> do you have much rage to begin with?
[11:44:18] <Aria> No...
[11:44:23] <Keith> then that isn't for you.
[11:44:31] <Aria> Unless I have a reason to get angry, but then usually my rage is called cute by some people...
[11:44:37] <Aria> my rage is usually not taken seriously
[11:44:47] <Keith> I reign mine in pretty good :)

[11:45:30] <Keith> under the right .... or some may say wrong conditions, my rage and hatred know no bounds :)
[11:45:33] <Aria> it reminds me of that scene from The Golden Compass
[11:45:42] <Keith> havent seen that in forever
[11:45:46] <Aria> where children get cut off from their magickal companions that are part of their souls
[11:45:59] <Aria> When you cut it off, it's not just your abilities that get bloked
[11:46:02] <Aria> blocked*
[11:46:04] <Aria> it's part of you...
[11:46:13] <Keith> oh gotchas.
[11:46:22] * Aria sighs...
[11:46:24] <Aria> Let's change the subject
[11:46:27] <Keith> that could have been something that happened.  evryone is different
[11:46:37] <Aria> To something less horrifying
[11:46:44] <Keith> do you have to work?? or are you still in school?
[11:46:50] <Aria> I study at home
[11:46:59] * Keith nods
[11:47:07] <Keith> what do you study?? if you dont mind me asking
[11:47:43] <Aria> Web design at the moment, music production soon
[11:47:57] <Keith> awesome.  i wish you the best of luck Aria :)
[11:48:02] <Aria> Thank you Keith :)
[11:48:10] <Keith> of course :)
[11:49:01] * Aria shivers
[11:49:18] <Keith> whats wrong?
[11:50:07] <Aria> worst part is, I hadn't hurt anyone, the binding was a dramatic overreaction that came from the thought that I "didn't know what I was doing" when it came to sensing and scanning people... I never cursed anyone and I know people who do intentional harm with magick who *don't* get bound, yet I got bound for some simple scanning...
[11:51:07] <Aria> Well... I guess it makes you realise how fragile it all is...
[11:51:22] <Keith> indeed
[11:51:41] <Aria> I want to learn to defend myself against people who haphazardly bind for no good reason...
[11:52:31] <Keith> I think of bindings like being tied up in rope with lots of knots.... undo a knot at a time... the binding falls apart
[11:53:11] <Aria> What if it's tied to a physical poppet that keeps it in existence?...
[11:53:38] <Keith> everything only has so much energy
[11:53:52] <Keith> before the workings fall apart
[11:53:54] <Aria> Ohh!
[11:54:04] <Aria> But how do you undo a knot if your access to the astral is cut off?
[11:54:29] <Keith> astral isn't the only place there is energy
[11:54:42] <Keith> energy is everywhere... in everything
[11:55:16] <Aria> Okay, let me rephrase that: If your access to energy manipulation is cut off
[11:55:50] <Keith> the truth??
[11:56:18] <Aria> yes
[11:56:32] <Aria> Basically that binding blocked all connections to everything
[11:57:06] <Keith> the only thing will truly limit your use of energy is you.  if you believe it can be done, then it can be.  you just need to believe in yourself.
[11:57:37] <Aria> Ohh!!...
[11:57:50] <Aria> So even if all connections are blocked off, I can still use my own energy to untie myself?
[11:58:05] <Keith> yup.
[11:58:33] <Aria> And they can't block my energy itself? or energy manipulation?
[11:58:35] <Keith> you know how if someone shoots down your confidence you usually dont do things as good as you normally could??
[11:58:40] <Aria> Yes...
[11:58:57] <Keith> it is all your personal strength and belief within yourself.
[11:59:16] <Keith> energy is in everything and everywhere.... you will never be without energy.
[11:59:33] <Keith> you need only faith the faith and strength within yourself.
[12:02:50] * Keith ponders making some food
[12:04:00] <Keith> though words can have great power over ones mindset
[12:05:15] * Aria nods...
[12:05:17] <Aria> They can
[12:05:49] <Keith> indeed
[12:06:12] <Keith> so just trust your mind and your heart, and you can never truly be stopped :)
[12:06:55] * Aria nods :)
[12:09:23] <Keith> :D
[12:19:05] * Keith sheds a single tear cuz he is waiting for tea to be made once more
[12:20:15] * Keith sucks up the tear back into his eye, because he now has more tea

[13:55:03] <Aria> for visitors
[13:55:15] <Aria> I was talking to a specific person
[13:55:20] <Aria> I could feel myself filling with anger
[13:55:23] <Aria> very strong anger
[13:55:25] <Aria> ...
[13:55:30] <Aria> it was hard to get rid of
[13:55:35] <Keith> usually is
[13:56:30] <Aria> i don't know whether it was my anger or his anger
[13:56:40] <Aria> usually i'm able to tell whether it's external..
[13:57:11] <Keith> through chat it can be awkward
[13:57:35] <Aria> usually even through chat i can tell
[13:58:06] <Keith> can't be accurate all the time.

[14:01:01] <Keith> Aria... when you felt angry, what was it towards?
[14:01:11] <Aria> Him.
[14:01:20] <Keith> what was he talking about?
[14:03:40] <Aria> He was trying to get my friendship by pitying himself, also he was denying things he did

[17:02:24] <Abraxas> Welcome, Witchit. Every decision you make is not a decision about what to do; it’s a decision about who you are.
[17:02:30] <Witchit> Hey guys :)
[17:02:34] <Keith> morning Witchit
[17:02:38] <Witchit> Hey Keith!
[17:02:43] <Keith> I seem to be the only one about
[17:02:51] <Witchit> Ah
[17:03:00] <Witchit> Well that's too bad, because something odd just happene
[17:03:03] <Witchit> *happened
[17:03:08] <Keith> please share
[17:03:30] <Witchit> So I made a scrying mirror to sell, and I said "might as well take pictures for Facebook"
[17:03:45] <Keith> uh huh
[17:04:05] <Witchit> So I did, not noticing that my phone was randomly on flash, which I didn't touch in the first place. I thought that was kind of weird until the flash went off
[17:04:07] <Witchit> And THEN
[17:04:08] <Witchit> I saw this
[17:04:12] <Witchit> http://imgur.com/gCo2JRg
[17:04:17] <Witchit> Right in the mirror
[17:04:30] <Witchit> No other person or object was there in the reflection
[17:04:38] <Witchit> Except that
[17:04:41] <Keith> it looks kinda smudged
[17:05:20] <Witchit> I guess it could be smudgings, but it looked like a person which scared me at first XD
[17:05:53] <Keith> i see a kinda birdish figure.. but i think it is just finger smudges
[17:06:14] <Witchit> Oh no, I see a full on person with a face and stuff
[17:06:17] <Witchit> But that's just me
[17:06:57] <Keith> not me personally
[17:07:11] <Witchit> Eh, I knew it wasn't anything special anyway :)
[17:07:16] <Keith> maybe in person it is easier to see.
[17:07:17] <Witchit> I was just weirded out at first
[17:08:24] <Keith> i am sure all is good
[17:08:28] <Witchit> I guess....I saw a bunch of things move in the scrying mirror, but I don't think it works in the middle of the day :P
[17:08:48] <Keith> i've never used one
[17:09:01] <Witchit> Me neither...but I thought it would be nice to learn more about it
[17:09:15] <Keith> I wish you the best of luck
[17:09:45] <Witchit> Thanks! Once I clean the mirror a little more, then I won't be as superstitious :P
[17:10:21] <Witchit> Right now it's on Facebook for $10, but I know it'll take a while until someone actually sees it
[17:10:29] <Witchit> FB can be really overwhelming
[17:10:39] <Keith> how so?
[17:10:50] <Witchit> (Thanks for the high-five by the way)
[17:10:57] <Keith> yer welcome :)
[17:11:32] <Witchit> It seems to be filled with either quotes from god or just inspirational quotes and friends who think it's a good idea to take pictures of the most random stuff
[17:11:48] <Witchit> I clicked on a friend's video of him just walking down the street for 5 minutes
[17:11:54] <Keith> lol
[17:11:55] <Witchit> It was strange 0_o
[17:12:26] <Witchit> And then they fill up so much that when I put down one post they put down like twenty-three
[17:12:31] <Keith> I dont think it is really something to be over whelmed about
[17:12:58] * Keith hugs da Witchit
[17:13:48] <Witchit> -hugs- :)
[17:13:51] <Keith> looking at your post for the scrying mirror, I dont see a pic up of it
[17:13:57] <Witchit> Really?
[17:13:59] <Witchit> That's weird
[17:14:02] <Keith> yup

[17:20:53] <Keith> I am glad you are learning new things
[17:22:59] <Witchit> I wish I knew how to be a better witch...takes a lot of practice to manipulate your body like that
[17:23:30] <Keith> lol she healed someone else.... but yes it takes practice
[17:24:09] <Witchit> Well yeah, I knew that. Totally. Not really. :P

[17:36:31] <Witchit> I've never seen you do divination, so I wouldn't know
[17:36:41] <Witchit> But it just takes practice...
[17:36:42] <Keith> that is cuz I never do it lol
[17:36:53] <Keith> oh I know :)
[17:36:55] <Witchit> I guess XD

[17:46:17] <Iona> I suspect that it'll be routine in a while...
[17:46:42] <Keith> it is getting to be that way already :)

[17:47:51] <Witchit> I heard about a space elevator or something
[17:48:02] <Keith> i dont think that will happen anytime soon.

[17:49:13] <Keith> we'll get there in time Witchit :)
[17:49:33] <Witchit> Yay :D
[17:49:58] <Witchit> Just as long as nothing happens that ends up hitting the elevator
[17:50:11] <Witchit> One little piece of shrapnel and we all die :/
[17:50:15] <Keith> i'm not to worried about that.
[17:50:39] <Keith> it would be a quick and painful, agonizing death :)
[17:50:49] <Witchit> Yaaaay.

[17:51:09] <Aria> down
[17:51:27] <Keith> stupid forest fires
[17:51:29] <Witchit> Aria, you still hyper?
[17:51:38] <Aria> I just shot some of my hyperness at someone (with consent) and they felt it and they were seriously hyper for some time and then they had like the equivalent of the after-effect of a sugar rush
[17:51:38] <Witchit> Ouch....that sucks Keith
[17:51:47] <Aria> Yea, a  ibt
[17:51:50] <Aria> a bit*

[17:52:24] <Witchit> Okay....well I'm sure you will calm down soon. Maybe you can do something to pass the time besides being on chat..?
[17:52:37] <Witchit> That's good at least
[17:52:51] <Witchit> But that's also a shame that forest fires are starting to become more common
[17:53:16] <Keith> yeah.... lack on rains are doing it.... and higher than average temperatures as well
[17:53:27] <Keith> green house effect and all that

[18:34:35] <Keith> morning H-
[18:34:39] <H-> o/
[18:34:43] <Witchit> pepperoni :3 I started cooking for the first time a few days ago and now I can't stop
[18:34:46] <Keith> how's you?
[18:34:48] <Witchit> Hi H-!
[18:34:59] <Keith> pizza is a good start :)
[18:35:01] <H-> a bit meh.. I'll survive ;)
[18:35:02] <Witchit> Today we're talking about...um...er....I like pizza?
[18:35:04] <Keith> did you make your own dough?
[18:35:12] <Witchit> Oh god I wish
[18:35:20] <Witchit> I'm not that advanced yet
[18:35:23] <Keith> hehe
[18:35:36] <Keith> H-, I am sure you'll pull through
[18:35:44] <Witchit> The first cookbook that I got though was a Hershey's cookbook
[18:35:49] <Witchit> You could imagine why I started :P
[18:35:59] <Keith> cuz of chocolate?
[18:36:10] <Witchit> ......
[18:36:11] <Witchit> -hides chocolate-
[18:36:15] <Witchit> No
[18:36:18] * Keith chuckles
[18:36:36] <Keith> i make simple treats quite a bit
[18:36:39] <Witchit> H-, here for you if you ever need to talk :)
[18:36:55] <Witchit> Like what?
[18:36:57] <Keith> yummy rice krispy squares
[18:37:02] <Keith> with real fruit
[18:37:10] <Witchit> Oh god that sounds amazing
[18:37:26] <Keith> yup... my favorite is with strawberry, or raspberry
[18:37:37] <Keith> cranberry aint bad as well :)
[18:38:29] <Witchit> The first thing I ever made cookbook wise is chocolate pudding
[18:38:40] <Witchit> Only one person ever got to taste it besides me XD
[18:39:01] <Keith> yer b/f?
[18:39:18] <Witchit> Nope, my mom for like 2 seconds before I devoured that one too
[18:39:24] <Keith> lol
[18:39:34] <Keith> rice krispy squares are so easy
[18:39:40] <Witchit> I'll cook something for my bf one day
[18:39:50] <Keith> do something for his birthday :)
[18:40:05] <Witchit> Yeah, I think my dad made those rice krispy squares
[18:40:10] <Witchit> I might ^ ^
[18:40:15] <Keith> :D
[18:40:16] <Witchit> It would be fun
[18:40:27] <Witchit> Rice krispy squares are super easy
[18:40:36] <Keith> and when you cook for special occassions it is something that comes from the heart
[18:40:37] <Witchit> Though I was five and most of the time set things on fire instead
[18:40:44] <Keith> lol
[18:41:09] <Witchit> I am a pyromaniac and (slightly) proud!
[18:41:38] <Keith> same here.... I enjoy the flame :)
[18:41:40] <Witchit> Nah, in truth it was by accident
[18:42:08] <Witchit> Well, I don't light things on fire anymore
[18:42:19] <Witchit> But I used to be a complete moron
[18:42:22] <Keith> not even campfires?
[18:42:32] <Witchit> "Sarah, would you hand me the-- WHY IS THE CEREAL ON FIRE"
[18:42:37] <Witchit> "Berkfest!"
[18:42:46] <Keith> yeah when i was younger i use to run the lighter along the coffee table in the house
[18:42:58] <Witchit> ...ooooh dear
[18:43:07] <Keith> but never caught it on fire
[18:43:19] <Witchit> Good, that's a relief XD
[18:43:23] <Keith> yuppers
[18:43:37] <Witchit> Would you get scolded?
[18:44:02] <Keith> oh yes......... at least a smack on the hand or a belt across the ass
[18:44:14] <Witchit> Oh wow...
[18:44:25] <Witchit> I never got physically punished
[18:44:31] <Keith> but i understand the serious of it, so it doesnt bother me
[18:44:39] <Keith> i did quite a bit.
[18:44:51] <Keith> but i was dumb and deserved it... cuz I knew better lol
[18:45:21] <Witchit> One time my dad threw a chair at me, but then hugged me and said he was sorry. That's like the only physical thing that ever happened
[18:45:30] <Witchit> (that was during punishment)
[18:45:40] <Keith> oh wow... that is kinda harsh
[18:45:53] <Keith> but at least he apologized for that
[18:46:05] <Witchit> He regrets it to this day
[18:46:15] <Witchit> It's because his dad physically punished him in the past
[18:46:22] <Keith> gotchas
[18:46:32] <Witchit> It really depends on the kid for physical punishment
[18:46:36] <Keith> there is a thin line between punishment and abuse
[18:46:41] <Witchit> Yeah
[18:47:18] <Witchit> I never really want anyone to go through what happened to my dad
[18:47:27] * Keith nods
[18:48:01] <Witchit> Especially since his dad and mom both died when he was 24. They died of cancer, and it was the scariest thing to him
[18:48:32] <Keith> yikes.... tobad
[18:49:04] <Witchit> Not saying that his dad was completely at fault though. There was abuse when my dad's dad was alive, and then it goes back and back
[18:49:19] <Witchit> We were a really harsh family, especially on my dad's side
[18:49:22] <Keith> yeah... it usually carries through.
[18:49:43] <Witchit> My dad broke the cycle though :) I'm happy that he's happy
[18:50:00] <Keith> it takes a lot of personal strength to stop something like that
[18:50:41] <Witchit> Yeah...I love my parents dearly. Almost every single person in our family has these weird stories
[18:51:05] <Keith> I hope they live long full lives

[19:28:49] <Aria> I crashed
[19:28:51] <Aria> I feel so exhausted
[19:28:53] <Aria> Keith
[19:28:56] <Aria> This is new to me
[19:29:02] <Hrafnbjorn> whats the topic npw?
[19:29:02] <Witchit> We're talking about Peter Popoff
[19:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> *now
[19:29:05] <Keith> like i said... you have to take it easy
[19:29:12] <Aria> I couldn't, Keith ...
[19:29:14] <Aria> After what I did
[19:29:19] <Witchit> A priest who scams through letters
[19:29:20] <Aria> It was surging
[19:29:22] <Aria> I needed to release
[19:29:26] <Keith> hence you need to learn self control :)
[19:29:37] <Aria> What kind of self control?
[19:29:42] <Aria> I didn't dump it into anything without consent
[19:29:43] <Keith> you need to learn how to ground then
[19:29:43] <North> Witchit, what was the gist of the letter?
[19:29:44] <Witchit> Yeah, sometimes channeling energy to another can be dangerous :(
[19:29:46] <Aria> Except maybe the TV
[19:29:58] <Witchit> So I never got one, but I've seen others who have
[19:30:04] <Aria> but the person gave me consent and she loved the rush
[19:30:05] <Keith> Aria.... just ground the energy into the earth
[19:30:11] <Aria> Yes....
[19:30:18] <Aria> I tried that, Keith, but it kept regenerating
[19:30:32] <Keith> so keep doing it lol
[19:30:36] <Aria> Good point..
[19:30:39] <Aria> Until it's depleted?
[19:30:48] <Keith> not depleted, just manageable
[19:30:51] * Aria nods
[19:30:52] <Witchit> He targets mainly the sick, poor, disabled, and others who can't think straight with life. He goes 'Need joy in your life again? Just give me $50 and I'll pray for you"
[19:30:54] <Aria> I'm depleted now
[19:30:58] <Aria> i'm exhausted
[19:31:08] <North> despicable
[19:31:14] <Aria> also hi North :)
[19:31:16] <Witchit> He got so much money though
[19:31:27] <Keith> that is so sad, a person would use such a position to screw people over.
[19:31:28] <Aria> gods
[19:31:29] * North waves to the depleted Aria
[19:31:31] <Aria> I come in here
[19:31:34] <Aria> I tell all these things
[19:31:38] <Witchit> After being revealed, he STILL does it to this day
[19:31:40] <Aria> Tales of advanced magick
[19:31:44] <Aria> And you guys are just supposed to believe it
[19:31:52] <Aria> im glad you do, though
[19:31:54] *** Iona`broody is now known as Iona
[19:31:55] <Aria> but uuuugh
[19:31:55] <Keith> I have no reason not to believe you
[19:32:02] * Iona hugs Aria
[19:32:03] <Keith> welcome back Iona
[19:32:03] <Aria> Wow...
[19:32:06] * Aria hugs Iona 
[19:32:09] <Witchit> I believe you Aria :)
[19:32:18] <Edward> I believe that Witchit believes
[19:32:20] <Aria> You all believe me? O.O
[19:32:27] <Aria> They're such big things to claim
[19:32:27] <Edward> What we talkin' bout
[19:32:29] <Aria> Without showing proof
[19:32:29] <Witchit> Yeah!
[19:32:30] <Keith> Aria- are you lying?
[19:32:32] <Aria> No
[19:32:38] <Keith> then I believe you :)
[19:32:38] <Edward> Aria what are you talkin bout
[19:32:44] <Iona> Aria, it's yet another day in my world...  
[19:32:47] <Witchit> You're my friend, of course I believe you ^ ^
[19:33:07] <Iona> to me, things like that are common.
[19:33:12] <Aria> :)
[19:33:15] * North believes in astral wine, at the very least ;)
[19:33:15] * Aria hugs Iona 
[19:33:15] * Hrafnbjorn is lost in the convo
[19:33:26] <Aria> Even healing physical ailments, Iona?
[19:33:46] <Aria> uuuuugh im so exhausted
[19:33:47] <Witchit> Hrafnbjorn: She healed someone over skype, and then was super hyper
[19:33:52] <Iona> Yes, Aria
[19:33:58] <Iona> Hello Hrafnbjorn 
[19:33:58] <Aria> thank you Iona :)
[19:34:06] * Keith ponders going for a nap
[19:34:16] <Hrafnbjorn> oh, I see, thanks Witchit
[19:34:23] <Aria> yes.. I was super hyper and needed to release the energy
[19:34:24] <North> naps do a fella right
[19:34:26] <Hrafnbjorn> hey Iona, how are ya today?
[19:34:31] * North spouts folksy wisdom
[19:34:40] <Aria> and I did, for like 30 minutes, and now I'm wiped out
[19:34:40] <Keith> indeed they do, North :)
[19:34:55] <Aria> I was seriously amazed at myself
[19:35:03] <Witchit> 30, wow...that's gotta take a lot out of you
[19:35:07] <Aria> Yes...
[19:35:24] <Witchit> Yeah, just relax right now :) It's over
[19:35:27] <Aria> yeah..
[19:35:37] <Iona> Things for me are well, if complicated.  Thanks for asking, Hrafnbjorn 
[19:35:42] <Aria> relax.... rest...
[19:36:01] <Keith> like i said... take a break from magic for a bit, and just relax.  let yourself recover
[19:36:07] <Aria> maybe even more than 30, Witchit 
[19:36:18] <Aria> Keith: A friend was in need of healing and so I tried...
[19:36:27] <Aria> I mean, she's one of my practice partners so
[19:36:46] <Aria> It kinda was a situation that was presented to me and I was like.. okay, let's try this
[19:36:47] <Witchit> Wow....you probably should have breaked longer between the astral plane session and healing someone
[19:36:49] <Keith> a sprained ankle isn't really that bad.... icing it, or a tensor bandage wuld have helped as well
[19:36:58] <Aria> it was her entire leg, i think
[19:37:09] <Aria> i'll ask her
[19:37:34] <Witchit> I think it's a big accomplishment, but it might take too much energy to help her when you already had done so much already
[19:37:36] <Aria> but yeah.. once I saw what I did.. I just went completely hyper
[19:38:02] <Aria> Witchit: Yeah.. it did take quite a lot of energy.. But somehow, it gave me a LOT of energy in return. Like I haven't been that hyper in YEARS, I think
[19:38:31] <Witchit> It's still not healthy to be that energetic though :( Especially for that long
[19:38:37] <Aria> Trueeee...
[19:38:41] <Aria>  it just had to release
[19:39:17] <Witchit> Well now you're tired and I'd rather you stay that way for now XD
[19:39:26] <Aria> yeaaaaaahhh....
[19:39:30] <Keith> once you learn to ground better you should be fine in those situations
[19:39:37] * Aria nods
[19:39:41] <Aria> Keith,I have a grounding problem
[19:39:48] <Keith> so practice
[19:39:58] <Aria> it's hard for me to ground, because I link directly into the core of the earth, but the core of the earth is sometimes hard to find
[19:39:58] <Hrafnbjorn> IMO the use of ones vital energy in any sort of doing is like a river, and sometimes, once that flow gets started, if ya dam it up (or in this case stop too soon perhaps) it causes a flood.  Hyperactivity is not good for the soul, so when ya feel hyper after a doing, perhaps it is wise to use that energy up
[19:40:28] <Keith> you can also ground yourself with the air.... just release the energy outwards
[19:40:35] <Keith> that is usually what i do
[19:40:44] <Aria> Wait... really? oh wow... but...
[19:40:48] <Aria> Doesn't the energy then spread around?
[19:41:10] <Keith> energy will travel no matter through air or earth
[19:41:10] <Hrafnbjorn> it spreads through Earth too
[19:41:11] <Aria> Hrafnbjorn: That's what I did - I used it all up
[19:41:20] <Aria> Ahhh....
[19:41:26] <Aria> Doesn't it have bad effects though?
[19:41:33] <Aria> If I just release energy into the air around me?
[19:41:43] <Keith> i havent had any issues
[19:42:08] <Keith> but okies... i a gonna go nap :)
[19:42:12] <Aria> I'll try it...
[19:42:18] <North> happy sleeps
[19:42:20] <Aria> I do sometimes kind of.... um...
[19:42:26] <Aria> Release energy as a sort of blast outwards
[19:42:29] <Witchit> Bye Keith!
[19:42:30] <Aria> into the air
[19:42:39] <Keith> laters Witchit :)
[19:42:50] <Aria> I think that may be a bit too intense though
[19:42:51] <Aria> good night Keith :)
[19:42:56] <Aria> have a nice nap ^^
[19:43:03] <Keith> thankies :)

[23:18:28] <AntleredGirl> Oh my it was an experience--an eye-opening, soul-wrenching experience.
[23:18:35] <Iona`gone> Oh my...
[23:18:48] <AntleredGirl> Just an amazing place to be and amazing people to share it with. 
[23:19:10] <Edward> Ohai AntleredGirl 
[23:19:11] <AntleredGirl> Got to dance around the Beltane fire like a heathen, experienced a Red Tent, met an amazing tribe that took us under their wing.
[23:19:28] <AntleredGirl> There just was nothing better at that point. I'm still mentally there.
[23:20:09] <Iona`gone> :D
[23:21:06] <AntleredGirl> I'm glad to be home, though. Brought home a new wand and a new statue.
