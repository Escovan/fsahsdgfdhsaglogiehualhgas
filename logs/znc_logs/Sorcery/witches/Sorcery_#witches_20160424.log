[01:54:17] <Keith> doing good... just finisheds making supper :)
[01:55:20] <SpiritSong> oh damn
[01:55:39] <Keith> an easier way to clean carpet stains..... simply pour water on the carpet where the stain is to dilute the darkness of what you spilled on the carpet... takes long to dry but it works
[01:56:10] <Keith> takes longer even
[01:56:48] <Widdershins> i used oxyclean
[01:56:56] <Widdershins> its pretty darn good
[01:57:00] <Keith> that works as well
[01:57:23] <SpiritSong> i use avoid carpetine 
[01:57:29] <SpiritSong> O_o
[01:57:32] <Widdershins> our carpet is from the 80's

[02:29:31] <North> I was a bit disappointed with the new Star Wars one
[02:29:32] <SpiritSong> black and whites can be great
[02:29:37] <SpiritSong> i havent seen enough of rthem
[02:30:04] <North> not that it was a terrible film, by any means
[02:30:14] <SpiritSong> i havent seen it,,or the odl ones
[02:30:46] <Widdershins> i was too tbh
[02:30:50] <North> the original trilogy: highly recommended
[02:31:02] <Widdershins> but i did enjoy it... just not thrilled
[02:31:08] * North nods
[02:31:15] <North> bit too much of a carbon copy
[02:31:20] <Widdershins> too much formula and trite dialogue
[02:31:27] <North> indeed
[02:31:51] <Widdershins> its funny 
[02:32:10] <Widdershins> ive noticed dialogue in films had suffered in the texting age
[02:32:30] <North> how so?
[02:32:37] <SpiritSong> the texting age has ruined peoples vocabulary 
[02:32:51] <North> does seem to be a trend there
[02:32:53] <Widdershins> it seems...kinda predictable 
[02:33:08] <Widdershins> not really fluid
[02:33:22] <Widdershins> maybe its poor acting..
[02:33:30] <North> that may be true for the majority of films
[02:34:10] <North> really liked the Birdy-recommended 'Inside Out', though
[02:34:12] <Widdershins> so much seems like its kinda cut and paste conversations
[02:34:26] <Widdershins> the cartoon?
[02:34:27] <SpiritSong> inside out is awesome
[02:34:42] <SpiritSong> yeah
[02:35:00] <Widdershins> that one was adorable
[02:35:09] <Widdershins> i liked the good dinosaur too
[02:35:10] <North> so much good stuff
[02:35:18] <North> haven't seen that one
[02:35:47] <Widdershins> its another pixar / disney thing
[02:35:52] <Widdershins> but well done
[02:36:07] <SpiritSong> i wanted to se that one

[17:45:12] <SpiritSong> heys H-
[17:45:44] <Hrafnbjorn> not yet, gonna take some when I get them polished a bit
[17:46:21] <SpiritSong> including any stones?
[17:47:57] <Hrafnbjorn> not yet... I thought about putting a round blood red stone on one, so the spiral makes the back base, but I need to get some thin coper wire cause I only have silver wire (except the thick copper the pendant is made from) and I dont know if the copper and silver will match well
[17:49:15] <SpiritSong> better off with just the copper imo:P

[17:52:01] <Hrafnbjorn> sorry about that
[17:53:30] <Hrafnbjorn> been also working on an article for reading/translating rune stones... but I cant figure out how to do so for webpage without using images, cause many folk may not have runic fonts on their computer, or have their browser set to override the page font
[17:54:00] <SpiritSong> thats ok
[17:54:26] <SpiritSong> hmm
[17:54:31] <Hrafnbjorn> plus... grammar ICK, lol
[17:54:40] <SpiritSong> your grammar is fine haha
[17:54:47] <SpiritSong> you explain things well
[17:55:16] <Hrafnbjorn> Dansk Tonga grammar was bad... got a little better later in Old Norse, but the languages of Viking Period and before was horrid
[17:55:19] <SpiritSong> maybe an imported image next to the explaination?
[17:55:46] <SpiritSong> hahha it was probably considered good grammar back then :P
[17:55:48] <Hrafnbjorn> certainly making image isnt hard, its just having to upload a bunch of images

[17:55:55] <SpiritSong> lanuage changed
[17:56:00] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed
[17:56:06] <SpiritSong> yeah that is a pain in the backside
[17:56:59] <Hrafnbjorn> I just thought it might be useful for folk to understand ya cant just replace Latin alphabet character with a rune stave and expect it to work
[17:57:44] <Hrafnbjorn> too many think its as easy as just substituting, but they end up with way misspelled stuff
[17:58:33] <Hrafnbjorn> its actualy easier (phoneticaly) than Latin alphabet, because there are no odd spellings with runes... it is spelled exactly how it sounds
[17:58:41] <SpiritSong> that wouldk make it more confusing no doubt :/
[17:58:49] <Hrafnbjorn> no doubled letters, no silent letters, etc....
[17:59:28] <SpiritSong> hah i like that about runes...being able to actually pronounce them xD
[17:59:39] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[18:01:27] <SpiritSong> Why not do it in another programe then upload one big image
[18:01:50] <Hrafnbjorn> I upset Velim once cause he used rune staves on his BOS, but just replaced the letters in "Book" and I pointed out that with runes multiples of same character, like the 'oo' are only done as magic formula, and evens are for cursing, so he ended up cursing his own book by using doubled o stave
[18:02:32] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, I may be able to do that, but it would show up small on the actual webpage, folk would have to load the image seperate
[18:02:57] <Hrafnbjorn> ... I will figure it out... probably have to go ahead and just upload images
[18:03:12] <SpiritSong> lmao!!!!!1

[18:03:58] <SpiritSong> try it both ways and see which people find easier to read maybe?#
[18:04:06] <Hrafnbjorn> something I think might fascinate folk is that runes were not typicaly carved on stuff with goal of others reading it... evidenced by how common professions of love were.  And it was illegal to write love letters to women back then
[18:04:09] <SpiritSong> you gotta log in H-
[18:04:31] <H-> I hate computers, It usually auto logs me in, it doesnt now :P
[18:04:36] <H-> thanks
[18:04:41] <SpiritSong> :)
[18:05:08] <SpiritSong> oh so runes were used to write love letters?
[18:05:40] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, and isnce it was illegal to write them, they were written in code
[18:06:52] <SpiritSong> why on earth would such professions of love be illegal
[18:07:12] <Hrafnbjorn> the letters were called mansongur.... it was considered ergi to write them, as well as for a woman to read them, however ergi aplied to males means unmanly, aplied to women means easy/trashy/lustful, etc
[18:07:44] <Hrafnbjorn> they were illegal because there was a belief that they came from a mans mind being bewitched and manipulated
[18:08:05] <SpiritSong> oh wow
[18:08:25] <Hrafnbjorn> it showed an obsession instead of action
[18:08:42] <Hrafnbjorn> it was good to act upon love, but not to obsess over it

[18:09:08] <SpiritSong> expression of love is important too haha
[18:09:20] <SpiritSong> otherwise they um,,get no action
[18:09:26] <SpiritSong> sorry i couldnt resist..omg
[18:09:58] <Hrafnbjorn> it wasnt so much illegal to express love, just the writing of love letters and such (even though it was common)
[18:10:12] <SpiritSong> so was the knowledge of runes more widespead because of this use?
[18:10:17] <SpiritSong> ahhh
[18:10:25] <SpiritSong> heys Emanon
[18:11:34] <Emanon> heya
[18:11:57] <Hrafnbjorn> perhaps... contrary to popular belief runes are NOT Heathen... while they came about during the HEathen period, there is NO mention of anything HEathen in any artifacts... and they were far more popular among Christians.  That being said, knowledge of runes was common, albeit probably not the magic aspect, just the writing of rune staves
[18:12:46] <Hrafnbjorn> during the Christian period the knowledge of the staves, as well as the magic become more popular
[18:14:03] <SpiritSong> so they were commonly known as a script, rather than a magic medium
[18:14:45] <Hrafnbjorn> yes, as magic it was likely specific to Odinist cults, which were very rare... mostly berserks and poets
[18:15:25] <Hrafnbjorn> vast majority of heathen folk back then wanted nothing to do with Odin, Freyr was most popular, followed by Thor
[18:16:03] <SpiritSong> why were the adverse to odin
[18:16:20] <Hrafnbjorn> because he is a trickster deity
[18:16:33] <Hrafnbjorn> he was THE trickster in Heathen lore
[18:17:27] <Hrafnbjorn> today Odin is most popular cause he is seen as the head god, and most powerful, both are true, but he is very manipulative and demanding
[18:17:36] <SpiritSong> a lot of people consider loki the trickster "god" ive read
[18:18:39] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, Loki wasnt one of the gods though, plus a tirckster uses manipulation and trickery to teach or cause change, Loki didnt do it for tht reason, he did it to cause harm and to work against those he claimed loyalty to
[18:19:50] <Hrafnbjorn> Loki was a jotunn (giant) that was only allowed in Asgard because he was Odin's 'blood-brother' but he was never accepted as a god, nor was he allowed in the counsel
[18:20:16] <SpiritSong> oh i know, i know people who worship him as a god, yet knowing he isnt one. it is a little confusing as ti why
[18:20:45] <Hrafnbjorn> one of the best sagas, and by far the most entertaining is Lokisenna, which is about when Loki was upset about not being allowed into the counsel, so he busted in, and started insulting all the gods
[18:20:49] <SpiritSong> loki doesnt sound like someone people should mess with
[18:21:17] <SpiritSong> did he satire them? or..
[18:21:51] <Hrafnbjorn> our definitin of god today is different... today it is any being that is worshipped, so by that definition, he is a god... back in Heathen period a god was a member of either Aesir or Vanir
[18:22:16] <Hrafnbjorn> he insulted them by pointing out their faults
[18:22:46] <Hrafnbjorn> like pointing out that the Vanic gods were incetuous, or that Odin participated in unmanly acts, etc...
[18:22:59] <Hrafnbjorn> *incestuous
[18:23:56] <Hrafnbjorn> of course this was all going on before Thor arrived... once Thor was close, Loki fled because he knew Thor was just waiting for a reason to squish him
[18:25:22] <SpiritSong> ahh ok i get you. 
[18:25:27] <SpiritSong> no doubt they didnt like that lol
[18:25:38] <SpiritSong> cowardly custard :P
[18:26:27] <Hrafnbjorn> nope... of course they tried to debate and argue, but one think not lacking in Loki was wit, so it made for funny interaction
[18:26:50] <Hrafnbjorn> think=thing
[18:27:19] <SpiritSong> i bet :P
[18:28:21] <Hrafnbjorn> I will give ya a quote to demonstrate the type of convo:
[18:29:03] <SpiritSong> kk
[18:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> Gefjun spake:
[18:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> 19. "Why, ye gods twain, | with bitter tongues
[18:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> Raise hate among us here?
[18:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> Loki is famed | for his mockery foul,
[18:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> And the dwellers in heaven he hates."
[18:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> Loki spake:
[18:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> 20. "Be silent, Gefjun! | for now shall I say
[18:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> Who led thee to evil life;
[18:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> The boy so fair | gave a necklace bright,
[18:29:04] <Hrafnbjorn> And about him thy leg was laid."
[18:29:06] <SpiritSong> :D

[18:30:36] <Hrafnbjorn> I think to understand why the bothered confronting him is to understand the concept of 'peace'
[18:31:12] * SpiritSong nods
[18:31:33] <Hrafnbjorn> peace in Old Norse is friðr, which implies a peace within ones folk, not peace as a whole.  It also has a defensive aspect where keeping frith also requires protecting it
[18:32:09] <Hrafnbjorn> ugh, I dunno why that came out as the accented s... it is supposed to be the edh character

[21:47:30] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah wood, or maybe stone
[21:51:01] <SpiritSong> what are you goin gto varve
[21:53:31] <Hrafnbjorn> dunno yet... I did a layout on the stone ya sent me (the one with the hole in it) so if I do go out and carve it will probably be that
[21:54:15] <Hrafnbjorn> gonna have rune-staves reading sÃ¦llir (blessed)
[21:54:47] <SpiritSong> nice :D
[21:54:52] <SpiritSong> its  hag stone
[21:54:58] <SpiritSong> hehe
[21:55:06] <Hrafnbjorn> :)
[21:55:25] <SpiritSong> it is for protection and in lore wheen you peer through the hole, you can see the astral realms
[21:55:27] <SpiritSong> :P
[21:55:57] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, maybe I should change the rune design to reflect that
[21:56:18] <SpiritSong> up to you :) 
[21:56:36] <SpiritSong> the faerie realm  specifically over here
[21:58:31] <Hrafnbjorn> are faerie considered land spirits?
[22:00:13] <SpiritSong> hmmm, i think so. there are different type of fae, may of which are lad and nature spirits
[22:00:24] <SpiritSong> the leshy is a big example
[22:00:28] <SpiritSong> literally...he is huge
[22:02:11] <Hrafnbjorn> so they would be most closely like the landvaettr from Heathen lore
[22:05:51] <SpiritSong> who are those?
[22:07:28] <Hrafnbjorn> labdvaettr are litteraly the landspirits
[22:07:56] <Hrafnbjorn> the spirits of the streams, trees, groves, etc...
[22:08:38] <Hrafnbjorn> in Icelandic lore it sorta includes he elves too, except they are specific to air and hills
