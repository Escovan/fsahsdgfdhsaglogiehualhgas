[03:49:54] * North imagines someone laying awake at night, dreaming this up
[03:50:31] <Keith> if the restraunt is still open it is called Vantage
[03:50:36] <Alyria> I often dream about what I would serve at a restaurant, were I to own one, as is the dream.
[03:50:59] <North> an menu item example, if you will
[03:51:07] <Keith> Alyria, if you open one... I will try to make it there and taste yer foods
[03:51:46] <North> suggested name:
[03:51:50] <North> Slop Shoppe
[03:52:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> There is a restaurant here in Milwaukee called Cafe Lulu that has a burger on their menu called "The 1/2 Pound Heart Attack".
[03:52:04] <North> because remember that time when you made delicious slop!
[03:52:27] <Keith> ArchrWndrMcRbrt, do you know what was in it?
[03:52:40] <Alyria> haha
[03:52:49] <Alyria> Remember, I'm always making slop
[03:52:51] <Keith> I would eat delicious slop
[03:52:54] <North> lol
[03:53:14] <North> always a huge crowd pleaser
[03:53:15] <Alyria> It would be Three Sisters Cafe
[03:53:32] <Alyria> Open early for breakfast and lunch, closing at 4pm.
[03:53:37] <Keith> can I do dishes for free food?
[03:53:42] <Alyria> soups, salads, sandwiches...
[03:53:44] <Alyria> etc.
[03:53:46] <Alyria> Sure.
[03:53:51] <Keith> lol woohooo
[03:54:57] <Keith> well, when you get it up and running...*ever the optimist*...I will do what I can do go down and taste your food
[03:55:53] <North> and I will author many glowing press releases
[03:56:06] <Keith> I will do a video on youtube to advertise it
[03:56:10] <Alyria> Excellent
[03:56:20] <Keith> and throw the video on FB as well
[03:56:23] <Alyria> well hm - let's not get carried away
[03:56:34] <Keith> there is tons of time :)
[03:58:57] <Keith> and i am not that good at making youtube videos yet.... I'm not very fancy
[04:01:03] <Alyria> I made really great cookies today.
[04:01:07] <Keith> damn it... my back is kinda tensing up
[04:01:20] <Alyria> They were to be chocolate chips, but Evie insisted they be mendems.
[04:01:26] <Alyria> I couldn't say no.
[04:01:30] <Keith> ohhhh..... Alyria, do you ever make rice krispy squares?
[04:02:06] <Alyria> I don't think I ever have, not the regular kind, anyway. 
[04:02:15] <North> mendems cookies sounds fantastic
[04:02:42] <Keith> well, I have been experimenting with various fruits being added to the recipe for them.  the results were most delicious
[04:02:53] <Keith> yay cookies :)
[04:02:54] <Alyria> I've made some kind of butterscotch, peanut butter, chocolate layer rice krispy sqaures
[04:03:03] <Alyria> ie. Grandma Shirley squares
[04:03:12] <Keith> i have used strawberries, raspberries, and cranberries
[04:03:19] <Keith> in seperate batches of course
[04:03:43] <North> is Grandma Shirley the drunk one?
[04:03:53] * North can never remember
[04:04:02] <Alyria> No not at all.
[04:04:07] <Alyria> She's the sweet one.
[04:04:19] <Keith> lol
[04:04:20] * North nods, attempting to commit this to memory for the nth time
[04:04:32] <Keith> that was random
[04:04:34] <Keith> hehe
[04:04:49] <Alyria> Grandmother Karen is the one who enjoys vodka and water - old family trick
[04:05:01] <North> ah, yes
[04:05:06] <Alyria> Every Tuesday.
[04:05:11] <Keith> ewwwww..... why do people dishonour booze in such a way
[04:05:42] <North> why Tuesday, I can't help but wonder
[04:05:46] <Alyria> No hangover and you can't smell it on your breath. Tis the way of older ladies
[04:05:57] <Keith> you can still smell it
[04:05:59] <Alyria> It's her groceries day.
[04:06:03] <North> aha
[04:06:04] <Keith> not as strong, but you still can
[04:06:14] <Alyria> She doesn't drive, and someone's always taken her on Tuesdays.
[04:06:34] <North> well, once a week doesn't sound too drunky
[04:07:04] <Keith> yeah that aint too bad
[04:07:44] <Alyria> I guess it was worse when mom was growing up.
[04:07:56] <Alyria> Plus, midday, middle of the week - makes it seem worse.
[04:08:06] * North shrugs
[04:08:14] * Alyria also shrugs
[04:08:18] <North> conventions
[04:08:42] <Alyria> Eah, I don't know. When Alaren was working a 3rd shift and drinking in the mornings, I hated it
[04:09:11] <North> odd-seeming
[04:09:23] <Alyria> Yes, thinks were so out of place
[04:09:46] <Alyria> ...things
[04:09:49] <Alyria> but thinks works too
[04:10:02] <North> in a big way
[04:10:24] <Keith> but at least things are better now, yes?
[04:11:48] <Alyria> I don't know, I live in a different country
[04:12:03] <Alyria> She can't hardly feel her feet and legs from MS anyway, so drink up I guess
[04:12:06] <Keith> i mean with Alaren
[04:12:07] <Alyria> the worst is already there :p
[04:12:19] <Alyria> Oh lol, yeah he hasn't done that shift for years
[04:12:25] <Keith> ysy
[04:12:27] <Keith> yay
[04:12:40] <Keith> yikes that is bad for your aunt

[04:21:15] <North> a saw a t-shirt recently, depicting the Stanley Cup featuring the Leafs' logo
[04:21:31] <North> beneath it, the caption:  "Please, God...just once before I die."
[04:21:40] <Alyria> Awww lol
[04:21:48] <North> which caused me to let out a quick bark of laughter
[04:21:59] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Been a loooooong time since the Leafs won it.
[04:22:03] <Alyria> I would like it for my daddy. My heart is with the Penguins, though.
[04:22:14] <Alyria> And they've recently won.
[04:22:25] <Alyria> Probbbbbably going to be killed in this round, though.
[04:22:25] <North> sure did
[04:23:48] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yeah, Round 2 didn't start so good for the Preds, but they're still my team in the NHL. I'm just happy the Blackhawks are out.
[04:24:02] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I hate those guys.
[04:24:19] <Alyria> I don't have any special hate for them, but I'm glad they're out.
[04:24:33] <Alyria> I'm tired of hearing their fans go on and on.
[04:25:05] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, I'm from Wisconsin, and most here dislike ANY team from Chicago, regardless the sport.
[04:25:33] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I hate the way they disrespect the Anthem.
[04:26:25] <Alyria> Ah I see
[04:26:26] <North> I was reading a dystopian Philip K. Dick tale earlier, featuring Chicago
[04:26:31] <North> which wasn't doing so well

[04:33:44] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I didn't realize that
[04:33:54] <North> guess you were a bit too young for Sgt. Pepper, at the time
[04:34:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> So, the last time they won The Cup was 1967?

[08:20:46] <Keith> was your bithday just recently?
[08:20:51] <Iona> yes.
[08:20:51] <CantSirDraggin> not sure if picked up on it, maybe smacked with it lol
[08:21:03] * Iona blushes...
[08:21:08] <Keith> well hell, Happy Belated birthday :)
[08:21:14] <Iona> thank you
[08:21:51] <Keith>  :)

[08:23:04] <Abraxas> Welcome, Emily. Enlightenment doesn't occur from sitting around visualizing images of light, but from integrating the darker aspects of the self into the conscious personality.
[08:23:21] <Keith> howdy Emily
[08:23:32] <Emily> Hi
[08:23:40] <Keith> how is you?
[08:23:47] <Emily> Tired
[08:24:08] <CantSirDraggin> i may know the solution to that
[08:24:21] <Iona> welcome Emily.
[08:24:22] <Keith> ummm...get some sleeps?
[08:24:23] <Emily> Hi
[08:24:30] <Emily> Can't sleep
[08:24:38] <Iona> What's keeping you up, Emily?
[08:25:02] <Emily> School
[08:25:03] <CantSirDraggin> i'm wondering what's keeping me up myself
[08:25:25] <Iona> Ahh...  stress from assignments or projects?...
[08:25:32] <Emily> Yes
[08:25:45] <Emily> To.the point I broke down in tears
[08:25:54] <Iona> I'm sorry...  
[08:25:59] <Keith> so sorry to hear it Emily.
[08:26:24] <Iona> What would be kindness to yourself at this time?
[08:26:37] <Emily> Idk
[08:26:39] <Keith> whats subject/s are bugging you?
[08:27:10] <Emily> German..... English.....game development...... Music
[08:27:17] <Emily> Math
[08:27:34] *** Quits: Raggiedmon (IceChat9@sorcery-5clbqt.abhsia.telus.net) (Quit: Now if you will excuse me, I have a giant ball of oil to throw out my window)
[08:28:10] <CantSirDraggin> was a music major myself, i get that one part anyway
[08:28:20] <Iona> It sounds like there's another cause, and the school issues are a symptom?...
[08:28:41] <CantSirDraggin> striped the fun out of playing having to learn so much music so fast
[08:29:39] <Emily> I love learning music theory...almost 5 years of learning to play the piano
[08:29:49] <Emily> Friends
[08:30:09] <CantSirDraggin> theory was kinda the easy part, heh
[08:30:20] <Emily> .I have awful friends and I'm auditioning for a accapella group
[08:30:34] <CantSirDraggin> well there's a starting point
[08:30:35] <Iona> hmmmm...
[08:30:51] <Iona> Yes, it does sound like a starting point..  Thank you for being a friend to us, and being vulnerable.
[08:31:23] <Keith> I definitely had issues in english
[08:31:32] <Keith> music was tough for me as well
[08:31:45] <CantSirDraggin> i've certainly told enough so called friends to f*** off over the years to call it a release
[08:32:00] <Keith> I wish you the best of luck in your endeavours
[08:32:07] <Iona> sometimes that's necessary, CSD
[08:32:32] <CantSirDraggin> on the other hand, i have none locally anymore really, which is its own downside
[08:32:40] <Keith> I have done the same thing....sometimes you just have to dump the dead weight from slowing you down
[08:33:41] <Keith> if you wish I can try sending some positive energy your way
[08:34:06] <Emily> I'm trapped.....
[08:34:17] <CantSirDraggin> no such thing
[08:34:18] <Emily> Highschool....all the lies....drama
[08:34:28] <Keith> it can be a living hell
[08:34:44] <Iona> guess what - drama will exist everywhere outside of high school too...  
[08:34:48] <Keith> but I need you to keep pushing on through, as tough as it can be.
[08:34:56] <Iona> we've all been there...
[08:35:01] <Iona> and you're not alone
[08:35:18] <Iona> find people who are low-drama for a while...  
[08:35:39] <Emily> But I have no.friends to create drama with....in college I'm gonna be a quiet musician
[08:35:43] <CantSirDraggin> hs social stuff is unneeded anyway it goes, all of those peeps will be in the past within a year of graduation
[08:35:44] <Iona> find people who will support you when you trip and fall (and not take advantage)
[08:35:55] <Keith> I agree with Iona.  try finding  and easy going crowd... or just relax on your own
[08:36:22] <Emily> My cat?
[08:36:34] <CantSirDraggin> the wuestion for a musician early is marketability, trust me
[08:36:49] <Keith> Emily, that can be a good start :)
[08:37:03] <CantSirDraggin> i went on a tuba, bad market
[08:37:16] <Iona> mmmm...  maybe we should stop telling you what we think you should do...  what do you think would benefit you, Emily?..
[08:37:21] <CantSirDraggin> music, while a great thing for yourself isn't a great path
[08:37:59] <Emily> Music therapist that's my goal
[08:38:09] <CantSirDraggin> went on a full scholarship, i change tires now
[08:38:15] <Keith> i dont think i have heard of that path.
[08:38:58] <Emily> Honestly Iona anything u guys can advise me......I'm drained I just want to graduate and sleep.for years
[08:39:12] <Iona> It sounds like a good way to serve the needs of others, Emily...  
[08:39:30] <Iona> well, I know the feeling-drained part...  
[08:39:35] <Keith> it never hurts to hear opinions of others to come up with a plan of your own...
[08:39:54] <Iona> it takes effort and fun and things like that to banish feeling drained...
[08:40:06] <CantSirDraggin> hs ends, and all of the peeps from there stop mattering, college does too, and you may keep a few more of those
[08:40:07] <Emily> I went to prom.....
[08:41:13] <CantSirDraggin> all in all the lesson growing up seemed to be that kids have no tact
[08:41:25] <Emily> Indimt care about the peers I'm graduating with....they all hate me
[08:42:46] <Keith> .....
[08:42:59] <Iona> that hurts...  
[08:43:03] * Iona hugs
[08:43:08] <CantSirDraggin> likely hate themselves too
[08:43:14] <CantSirDraggin> if not now then later
[08:44:07] <Emily> Prom I looked pretty but inside screaming at the top of my lungs. I was at a piano playing it the while time...I felt happy and calm just pouring myself into.it...my sister comes and asks if I'm.fine and she lefte alone after that
[08:44:25] <Keith> there is probably something you are better than them at, and they dont like that fact.  so they try to shut you down.  just remember, that in the end the only opinion of you that matters is your own.

[08:45:06] <Iona> Emily, what has helped me most in maintaining a healthy mind is meditation - and not the zoning-out kind...
[08:45:10] <CantSirDraggin> pouring energy through an instrument is a great release
[08:45:20] <Iona> music is very meditative...
[08:46:01] <Emily> During my darkest times in the past my arms would be covered in cuts and my mom madee west short sleeves I was pucked on so much
[08:47:14] <Iona> I hope you'll find something that brings you joy...
[08:47:29] <Emily> Meditation is good...
[08:47:42] <Emily> I don't cut anymore....
[08:47:48] <CantSirDraggin> good
[08:47:52] <Iona> :)
[08:47:59] <Iona> Again, thank you for being vulnerable...  
[08:48:09] <Keith> that is a good start
[08:48:11] <Emily> What?
[08:48:20] <Emily> Vulnerable?
[08:48:22] <Keith> for being open with us
[08:48:32] <Keith> to let it out with people you dont know.
[08:48:34] <Iona> ^ what Keith said
[08:48:56] * Keith gives Emily a tender hug if she wishes one
[08:49:08] <Emily> I love hugs
[08:49:11] <CantSirDraggin> at the end of the day you need to release more personally than this though
[08:49:26] <Keith> Emily.. do you write music at all?
[08:49:50] <Iona> agreed, CSD; but it's not my place to pry, and meditation may help her identify it if she doesn't know...  
[08:50:11] <CantSirDraggin> idk if piano bleeds it out the way winds do, but pavanne by ravelle was a good one for me
[08:50:14] <Emily> Idk how
[08:50:29] <Keith> if you ever need a hug let me know :)  I am full of them
[08:50:40] <Iona> that's okay...  do you experiment with your music?
[08:50:59] <Keith> what kind of music do you like to play on the piano?
[08:51:28] <CantSirDraggin> nm like to, play what has what you feel
[08:51:55] <Emily> Honestly this is a good thing releasing to people I don't know but talked to occasionally and from two.years ago
[08:52:01] <Iona> yes, if you feel sad, play something sad...  allow yourself to express...
[08:52:19] <Iona> if you feel happy, express happiness...  
[08:52:26] <Emily> I play a lot of random
[08:52:36] * Keith nods softly
[08:52:41] <Iona> (hint - anonymous sound clips can be shared!)
[08:53:02] <Emily> I just do what's in the music books
[08:53:10] <Iona> that's fine :)
[08:53:11] <CantSirDraggin> ffs, the song happy as done by wote is looping through my head Iona
[08:53:13] <CantSirDraggin> thanks
[08:53:28] <Iona> oh no...  CSD, you too?...
[08:53:43] <Keith>  HAHAHA.... I dont know that song
[08:54:02] <CantSirDraggin> wote is canadian, get with it Keith
[08:54:21] <CantSirDraggin> walk off the earth
[08:54:33] <Emily> But I play play fur Elsie to feel good.....I play all songs in a major Keys if I'm sad
[08:54:51] <Keith> I don't listen to much music
[08:54:51] <CantSirDraggin> minor has all the sad stuff...
[08:55:07] <Iona> Yeah
[08:55:38] <Iona> I remember listening to the Star Wars' Imperial March in a major key...  and it sounded...  celebratory... 
[08:55:39] <Emily> When I'm.sad I listen to nightwish
[08:55:57] <Iona> <3 Nightwish
[08:56:03] <Emily> I wish I can share my music here
[08:56:08] <Iona> I like Within Temptation too
[08:56:35] <Keith> CSD I found yer song........ I think
[08:56:37] <Iona> Well, if you feel it's safe to, you can - I suggested anonymous for a reason though - safety is a fragile thing.
[08:56:42] <CantSirDraggin> i'm listening to this death metal thing to purge happy from my brain atm
[08:57:09] <CantSirDraggin> well, a vid of a drummer without the vocalist
[08:57:10] <Keith> so it is happy by wote?
[08:57:22] <Emily> How do I share my recordings of piano here
[08:57:24] <Keith> get me a link old man
[08:57:37] <Keith> if you have them online Emily, just post a link
[08:57:46] <Iona> Well, the thing to do is to get a recording
[08:58:02] <Keith> i would suggest putting them on youtube
[08:58:35] <Keith> youtube is the key for lots
[08:58:36] <Emily> I'll do.that tomorrow
[08:58:41] <Iona> Or you can host them privately, like on Google, or Dropbox, or something else...
[08:58:44] <Keith> :) would love to hear your music
[08:58:51] <Iona> But once you have a location - you can share it
[08:59:42] <Keith> yuppers
[08:59:44] <Iona> Lots of people use pseudonyms to have a quasi-anonymity...  just so you know
[08:59:51] <Emily> Keith I want another hug....please :)
[09:00:08] <CantSirDraggin> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SImHi16cwqc   not happy by wote, lol

[09:01:59] <Keith> the second one i just seen
[09:02:43] <Emily> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t6l4H689FtM
[09:02:54] <CantSirDraggin> love the first one, a good measure as a musician that there's always room to improve your art
[09:03:29] * Iona clicks...
[09:03:44] <Emily> I'm doing that nigjtwish song as a choir final
[09:04:04] <Keith> i likes it so far
[09:04:23] <Iona> it's good, thanks :)
[09:05:02] <Iona> Hmmmm *listens to the Nightwish*
[09:07:40] <Emily> I love nightwish
[09:07:59] <CantSirDraggin> ontoxicated by a major chord....sung in an augmented chord, heh
[09:08:06] <Keith> i dont listen to them much... but a friend of mine has a huge thing for the group
[09:08:30] <Emily> I have every song
[09:08:37] <Keith> awesome.
[09:08:37] <Emily> From tarja to floor
[09:08:46] <Iona> :)
[09:10:35] <Emily> Only the weak.are not lonely?
[09:10:52] <Keith> huh??
[09:11:21] <CantSirDraggin> title reminds me of alice in chains love hate love
[09:11:38] <Emily> Idk what that means
[09:11:50] <Emily> Only the weak.are not lonely
[09:11:59] <Keith> no clue
[09:12:02] <CantSirDraggin> the strong go about their thing without side
[09:12:08] <CantSirDraggin> aide*
[09:12:17] <CantSirDraggin> idk
[09:12:22] <CantSirDraggin> my best guess
[09:12:41] <Emily> Slow love slow
[09:13:26] <Iona> CSD, thanks for sharing wote ;)
[09:13:27] <CantSirDraggin> often in music uneasily interpreted phrases must be looked at in their reverse
[09:13:30] <Emily> I feel better
[09:13:37] <Emily> I noticed that.
[09:14:10] <CantSirDraggin> or....in context of the musician's larger body of work
[09:14:59] <Emily> I feel better...like weight came off
[09:15:08] <CantSirDraggin> the augmented chord thing talking about loving major chords thing tickled me though
[09:16:16] <CantSirDraggin> gotta love intelligent and educated musician jokes thrown in there
[09:17:05] <Emily> Yes
[09:17:11] <CantSirDraggin> intentional accidentals, heh
[09:17:16] * Keith is perplexed
[09:17:39] <CantSirDraggin> Keith is clearly not shrp in this case, lmao
[09:17:49] <Keith> i get that one
[09:18:48] <Keith> and i find that joke pretty flat
[09:19:03] * CantSirDraggin pictures Keith picketing the local diner over shanging hands
[09:19:05] <Keith> MWAHAHAHA
[09:19:27] <Keith> shanging or shaking?
[09:19:35] <CantSirDraggin> changing*
[09:19:43] <Keith> lmao.......

[09:21:00] <Keith> ummm... no lol
[09:21:12] <CantSirDraggin> yellowish rum, heh
[09:21:45] <Keith> what rum is yellow?? that hasn't been used....
[09:21:57] <CantSirDraggin> bacardi
[09:22:09] <Keith> i suppose amber is yellow to you
[09:22:17] <CantSirDraggin> close enough
[09:22:41] <Keith> lol
[09:22:50] <CantSirDraggin> respect your elders Keith
[09:23:01] <Keith> umm....... no. respect is earned.
[09:23:27] <CantSirDraggin> don't make me stuff you back under your rock again
[09:23:42] <CantSirDraggin> :P
[09:23:43] <Keith> i'm to fat to fit under it.. so I aint worried
[09:23:47] <Keith> :D

[09:25:36] <CantSirDraggin> 5 peeps, one guitar
[09:26:35] <CantSirDraggin> i think magic is my fav though
[09:27:03] <CantSirDraggin> esp with how b.o.b. was so flat with his delivery, and wote just killed it

[17:36:19] <agent199> its only 8.30am for me .. so its bound to be quiet
[17:37:03] <XCuteWitchX> 11:37 AM here.
[17:40:26] <agent199> whats new with you cutewitch?
[17:41:44] <XCuteWitchX> Not much. Just thought I'd hop on here to get my mind off of things. I've always had depression but it's like it's worsening and I can't find a way out to cope.
[17:42:23] <agent199> have you seen a psychiatrist? depression is dangerous if not treated.
[17:43:18] <XCuteWitchX> Psychiatrists make it worse
[17:43:35] <agent199> all the drugs hey
[17:43:45] <agent199> i dont like the drugs either
[17:43:57] <XCuteWitchX> Never been to one but They don't care. They just want to fill your system with drugs and send you on your way
[17:43:59] <XCuteWitchX> Bad idea
[17:44:08] <XCuteWitchX> My father passed from addiction to those drugs
[17:44:38] <agent199> aww
[17:44:46] <agent199> i dont blame you for not wanting

[17:45:13] <XCuteWitchX> And not only that but you're a Guinea pig until you find something that works for you and even then you can become immune to it. Not to mention all the side affects and suicide can be triggered through them. So at that point even though I have been suicidal before, I'd rather deal on my own.
[17:46:40] <agent199> what you say makes a lot of sense too
[17:47:27] <agent199> i guess the best way to cope is to find something that makes you happy in life .. i dont know .. just a thought
[17:47:54] <XCuteWitchX> I've tried but nothing really does make me happy.
[17:48:29] <XCuteWitchX> Things I used to like before, I became uninterested in

[17:48:33] <Abraxas> Welcome, Alyria. Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.
[17:49:13] <agent199> i have a mental illness too, and i also lost interest in all the old things i used to love .. it does that to you
[17:49:48] <agent199> so i found new things to replace those .. like tarot and the occult lol
[17:50:28] <XCuteWitchX> I'll be honest. I hate the term mental illness. Makes those people sound crazy. I'm battling anxiety on top of it all.
[17:50:45] <agent199> i dont like the term either
[17:50:55] <agent199> somedays i think there is really nothing wrong with me
[17:53:45] <XCuteWitchX> I'll have moments like that. Then there are days when it's so unbearable you just wished you never existed.
[17:54:22] <agent199> yup
[17:55:02] <XCuteWitchX> Sounds a little like bipolar depression. If that's even a thing.
[17:55:20] <agent199> i think it is actually
[17:55:37] <agent199> i knew someone who had bipolar and she was a cool lady
[17:56:34] <agent199> was on tons of meds  though
[17:57:56] <XCuteWitchX> Me too. One day I'll be like, oh I love my life and it's such an amazing morning, blah blah blah. Then the next it's like I just want to just die basically. The thing with me is, sometimes ill think of something and randomly work myself up to feeling like this, though I can't help it. And yep. Meds can definitely do that.
[18:00:27] <agent199> yeah that sounds like bipolar and depression i think
[18:00:42] <agent199> aww you can beat it
[18:01:06] <XCuteWitchX> Doubt it. I honestly have no one I can vent to. I've lost everyone in my life.
[18:01:25] <XCuteWitchX> People can't handle it so they just walk out.
[18:03:23] <agent199> i only have one friend who is a religios freak .. not exactly someone i can vent to either .. when i moved here i lost all my old friends .. my mother is constantly telling me oh you need to be around people, its not good for your mental health .. but the frustrating part is that if you live in a small town where its not easy making friends .. what the hell can  you do
[18:04:24] <agent199> but
[18:04:31] <agent199> we can always vent out on irc
[18:07:02] <XCuteWitchX> I'm in that exact situation and it's funny you mentioned it. I've lived in this small town for 8 years and I've lost contact with almost everyone and the few friends or acquaintances I do have, I've grown apart with or are users. And in my town, everyone's judgmental and stuck up and has their own little "cliques". Which is why I gave up on meeting people
[18:07:02] <XCuteWitchX> and yes I am very antisocial. I cannot connect with anyone it seems and when I think I do, I lose them.
[18:11:16] <XCuteWitchX> So I really understand where you're coming from completely.
[18:11:30] <agent199> sounds like your just waiting for the right people to come along
[18:11:38] <agent199> i know i am
[18:11:59] <agent199> i am so tired of people telling me to turn to god for help when they really dont know im actually a pagan lol
[18:12:13] <CantSirDraggin> amen to that
[18:12:16] <XCuteWitchX> Seriously!!! I agree.
[18:13:08] <XCuteWitchX> My grandma sent me a Christian card to convert me on my birthday when she knows. But she never sent my mom one on her birthday. My moms was a normal happy birthday card. Pisses me off.
[18:13:31] <Alyria> Because god can heal a chemical imbalance anyway :eyeroll
[18:14:05] <agent199> lol exactly
[18:14:13] <XCuteWitchX> I should write on my grandmas card on her birthday "may the goddess bless you." And make sure it's a wiccan card. Why the double standard.
[18:14:14] <agent199> i cant stand the christians
[18:14:20] <XCuteWitchX> Me neither
[18:15:27] <agent199> and yes i agree .. why the double standards .. pisses me off too
[18:15:38] <agent199> but we are better than they are
[18:15:53] <agent199> so i wont stoop to their level
[18:16:14] <XCuteWitchX> In my opinion. What goes around comes around.
[18:17:01] <agent199> yeah i hear ya there
[18:18:23] <XCuteWitchX> Hell always sounded better then heaven anyway lol
[18:18:28] <XCuteWitchX> Than*
