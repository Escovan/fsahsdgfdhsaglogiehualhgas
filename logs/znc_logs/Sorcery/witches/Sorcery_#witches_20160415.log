[00:00:22] <EronGari> so, is Eso still keeping a low profile?  He'd do better to leave the channels alone
[00:01:23] <EronGari> yeah, and more than once I cut down reed in the river mouth and made a grass shack

[05:30:35] <DawnBat> somewhat
[05:31:13] <EronGari> yep, much so, but we have a number of folks who still speak and their kids renewed interest in speaking P'urhépecha
[05:31:27] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Not dead, DawnBat. They just don't want to get involved.
[05:31:44] <EronGari> a section of the newpaper comes out in that language
[05:31:59] <DawnBat> All I know is that there's Qui'Che Mayan
[05:32:04] <EronGari> they were the last native folk here conquered by the Spanish
[05:32:16] <EronGari> the first ones that had metalurgy
[05:33:03] <EronGari> and the whole area around Patzcuaro is made up of artizan villages with different specialties

[05:39:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It's about a device found in an ancient wreck. A mechanical device that tracked the orbits of the 5 planets known at the time, as well as the Sun and Moon, including phases. It predicted eclipses. It's astounding! And more so because the original was over 2000 years old

[06:12:09] <Keith> awesome.
[06:12:13] <Keith> i might look into it
[06:12:17] <Quadpod88> wait, ur a vet?
[06:13:06] <DawnBat> No xDDD
[06:13:16] <Quadpod88> i've just done the opening on it keith
[06:13:52] <DawnBat> so the website has Blogs?
[06:13:55] <Keith> sweet.
[06:13:56] <Quadpod88> haven't added anything of note yet, just my own welcome
[06:14:47] <DawnBat> MissSugar has a blog on the AltFaith site O_O
[06:14:53] <Quadpod88> and SpiritSong has been beefing out the forums, so hurry up before she takes all the good topics
[06:15:17] <Keith> i don't see why two people couldn't have the same topic... just different outlooks :)
[06:15:26] <MissSugar> oh look at that
[06:15:41] <Quadpod88> hey, i'm just advertising
[06:15:57] <Keith> I'mma do a video and put it on my youtube channel for the site
[06:16:06] <DawnBat> most posts are by Widders husbando

[06:17:05] <Keith> howdy meeb
[06:17:08] <Quadpod88> i'm just doing my part to get the site buzzing
[06:17:24] <DawnBat> so
[06:17:31] <Quadpod88> so, hows things ArchrWndrMcRbrt
[06:17:39] <DawnBat> There's Kemetic Orthodoxy on the forums (which I pretty much avoid like the plague)
[06:17:55] <Quadpod88> ???
[06:18:05] <MissSugar> im gonna have to wait to talk to wids about putting something in my blog
[06:18:11] <Quadpod88> not sure what that is
[06:18:29] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Not too bad, Quadpod88. How's yourself?
[06:18:40] <Quadpod88> could be worse
[06:18:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I know that feeling
[06:18:57] <DawnBat> Kemetic Orthodoxy is Ancient Egyptian Faith revived.
[06:19:06] <DawnBat> It's basically just a butchering of the old as I have seen 
[06:19:08] <Quadpod88> ah
[06:19:29] <Quadpod88> not our place to judge beleifs
[06:19:57] <DawnBat> Five basic tenets guide the faith of members: Belief in upholding Ma'at, Belief in Netjer (the supreme being), Akhu (Ancestor) Veneration, Participation in and Respect for the Community, and Acknowledgment of Siuda as the Nisut. Members of the faith are known as Shemsu.

[06:20:44] <DawnBat> It seems like they're making it a monotheistic system
[06:23:46] <Keith> well if they are just using the ancient Egyptian as  platform, what they do after that is up to them
[06:24:05] <DawnBat> I know.
[06:24:11] <DawnBat> Just kind of rustles me xD
[06:24:19] <Keith> to each our own :)
[06:24:29] <Quadpod88> happens alot, faith is a personal matter after all
[06:24:33] <DawnBat> true
[06:26:36] <Quadpod88> although, if done respectfully you could debate it
[06:28:23] <Keith> yup
[06:28:30] <Quadpod88> sometimes it's how we gain greater understanding
[06:28:35] <DawnBat> true
[06:29:11] <DawnBat> Just feels to me like what Christianity did with say holidays
[06:29:14] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And never worry over doubts. They are actually a good thing. Any belief that cannot stand up to questions isn't apt to be much.
[06:29:48] <DawnBat> I like that Archr
[06:30:00] <Quadpod88> until you get into circular reasoning
[06:30:08] <Keith> well said ArchrWndrMcRbrt
[06:31:02] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I let circular people just go ahead and stew, Quadpod88. After all, circles ARE pointless, are they not?
[06:31:20] <Quadpod88> but it's funny
[06:32:07] <DawnBat> I just, a montheistic system based on Kemet?
[06:32:08] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> hehehe
[06:32:30] <DawnBat> the ancient egyptian faith was enormous and lasted for thousands of years
[06:33:08] <Quadpod88> isn't that just the same as pantheist worshiping only one?
[06:33:58] <DawnBat> Wait what?
[06:34:13] <DawnBat> Not really. It's like Amenhotep all over again and the faith of Aten
[06:34:39] <Quadpod88> knows little of this
[06:35:38] <DawnBat> Amenhotep was a Pharoah who overthre the ENTIRE pantheon, raised up a monothestic system which decimated Egypt

[06:36:23] <Quadpod88> hmm
[06:37:14] <Quadpod88> denying the masses of their religion would be catastrophic
[06:37:30] <raevynskkyyemt> I read a historical fiction about that once
[06:38:09] * Quadpod88 resists the urge to mention the mummy
[06:38:23] <DawnBat> It just bugs me HEAVILY (more so than most Abrahamic Faiths) that such a (butchery?) could happen for such an old faith.
[06:38:32] <DawnBat> Quadpod88: The ones with Brendan Fraser?
[06:38:41] <Quadpod88> of course
[06:39:11] <DawnBat> I actually kind of like those xD
[06:39:14] <DawnBat> a lot
[06:39:20] <Quadpod88> it happens repeatedly throughout history
[06:40:46] <Quadpod88> abrahamic faiths are far from the only offenders, just happened to be the most successful
[06:40:52] <DawnBat> Yes
[06:41:24] <Quadpod88> hell, look at babylon
[06:41:37] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Alas, Babylon
[06:42:02] <Quadpod88> changed faiths more times than any1 will ever know

[06:53:51] <Quadpod88> there's always the speech from footloose
[06:54:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I saw a graet FB meme concerning kilts, Quadpod88. A pic of Liam Neeson from "RobRoy", and the caption read, "It's called a kilt because we kilt everyone who called it a skirt."

[06:55:24] <Keith> hehe
[06:55:51] <Quadpod88> i have so many kilt memes
[06:55:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I loved it. And I believe my great Grandfather would have, too.
[06:56:10] <Quadpod88> mainly cause the wife saves them
[06:56:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Clan MacLean, he was
[06:56:34] <Keith> if any for me it would be Clan Henderson or something
[06:57:20] <Quadpod88> due to my last name, i have to sport welsh colors of house evans
[06:57:32] <raevynskkyyemt> I think my grandmother was a mclelland
[06:57:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> A good name, raevynskkyyemt
[06:58:28] <raevynskkyyemt> :) 
[07:05:30] <Keith> I think my last name is one of the most appropriate last names a person could have in my situation :)
[07:06:22] <Keith> Decendant of Henry :)
[07:07:32] <Keith> and me dad is Henry :)
[07:07:37] <Quadpod88> son of evan doesn't sound apropriate
[07:07:55] <Quadpod88> my real father's name was roy
[07:08:02] <Keith> doesn't quite thave the same ring
[07:08:54] <Quadpod88> and it's robertson on my mom's side
[07:09:05] <Quadpod88> down the line
[07:09:25] <Keith> perhaps that is decendant of Robert or something
[07:09:42] <Quadpod88> way down the line
[07:09:47] <Keith> thre you go
[07:10:20] <Keith> though you would need a der in the last name.... robertderson or something for decendant of robert
[07:10:23] <Quadpod88> sorry had to text her
[07:10:30] <Keith> no worries... I forgive you
[07:10:54] <raevynskkyyemt> Robertson is Robert's son
[07:11:06] <raevynskkyyemt> I don't think the Der is necessary

[07:13:42] <Quadpod88> or easter
[07:14:46] <Quadpod88> so someone changed their name on ellis
[07:14:51] <raevynskkyyemt> Might have been a change somewhere along the way

[22:25:23] <Keith> i would rather walk further
[22:26:14] <Hrafnbjorn> once upon a time I thought I had good insurance... then I needed to use it (house fire) but they gave the insurance $$ to my neighbor instead, so I saw none of it
[22:26:31] <SpiritSong> thats so fecked up
[22:26:39] <Keith> that's sucky balls
[22:26:55] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed, but what can I do, since it is my mom, lol
[22:28:03] <SpiritSong> :/ but her house wasnt damaged right?
[22:28:14] <Hrafnbjorn> was supposed to be 2 seperate properties, I bought one, she bought the other... when the insurance investigator came to investigate, we found out that it was an illegal sale, and both were supposed to be same property (even though its fenced seperate, and seperate address and such)
