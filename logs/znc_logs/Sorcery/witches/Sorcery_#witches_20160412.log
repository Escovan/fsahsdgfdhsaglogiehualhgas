[00:02:57] * North goodnaturedly chuckles
[00:03:53] <Iona> I would argue that love != clinging to love
[00:04:19] <North> that can certainly be a thing

[00:30:48] <Stormy> That's deep.
[00:30:56] <North> mm hmmmm
[00:30:59] <Stormy> I can't think that deep today. I have this headache.
[00:31:07] <North> sorry to hear
[00:31:21] <North> may it pass quickly
[00:33:21] <Stormy> Yea. I just took medication for it.

[00:40:05] <Stormy> Ooh~
[00:40:41] <North> a tale of incredulity, no less

[02:18:37] <North> good greetings, Victorian
[02:18:43] <XCuteWitchX> Hi North
[02:18:49] <North> how's the night?
[02:19:02] <XCuteWitchX> Sort of okay I guess, Your's?
[02:19:18] <North> same-ish
[02:19:26] <North> glad things are better in Tori Town
[02:19:38] <XCuteWitchX> Ehh
[02:19:47] <North> all things being relative
[02:20:07] <XCuteWitchX> Bad news about my job. 
[02:20:13] <North> tell of this thing
[02:20:21] <XCuteWitchX> This might take a bit to type..hold on a couple.
[02:20:29] <North> hokay
[02:25:50] <XCuteWitchX> So.. They f*cked me over on my check. I was supposed to be making $9.50 instead my last check I went to pick up got bumped down to minimum wage. I called Pepperidge farm and asked why. Apparently two no call no shows equal deducting your hourly wage from not finishing your assignment. Well, my hiring manager was on vacation for like a week and they HAVE
[02:25:50] <XCuteWitchX> records of me calling and letting them know I was quitting (before they practically begged for me to come back which I gladly accepted, but definitely not anymore). Called them 30 times and left messages. And no one had told me some guy was filling in for her. No one told me that. SO I called my temp service and went off on them. Then the receptionist at
[02:25:50] <XCuteWitchX> Spherion had the nerve to say "I'm so and so. You have no right talking to me like this. Do you know who I am? Are you handling this appropriately?" after telling her ass off and letting her have it. After that, I just hung up on her. They don't do their jobs anyway. Whenever I go in there they're always gossiping or flirting with the guys that walk in
[02:25:50] <XCuteWitchX> there. Temp services really f*ck people over. And I like how they never mentioned any of this what so ever in orientation. sorry this was so long.
[02:27:47] <North> no worries
[02:27:55] <North> what a frustrating process
[02:28:37] <North> was this the factory job?
[02:28:42] <XCuteWitchX> If I had money to hire a lawyer, trust me , i'd sue in a heartbeat.
[02:29:01] <XCuteWitchX> sort of, snacking factory/packaging.
[02:29:06] * North nods
[02:29:25] <North> sorry that didn't work out
[02:30:11] <XCuteWitchX> Then I went to the eye doctor after my glasses snapped and broke, and I have something going on with my cornea. Early stages of some big word they used.
[02:30:24] <North> :(
[02:30:51] <XCuteWitchX> Karetoconus I believe is what doc said.
[02:31:05] <North> hmm...not familiar with that
[02:31:09] * North googles
[02:31:44] <XCuteWitchX> apparently on the paper he gave me, only 1 in 1,000 people get it. I must be that 'rare' case. I have a string of bad luck it seems.
[02:32:12] <North> :(
[02:32:23] <North> has it affected your vision, thus far?
[02:32:57] <XCuteWitchX> A LOT. yes. Explains why things look distorted and why i'm blind in a part of my side vision.
[02:33:19] <North> jeez...
[02:33:45] <North> has a course of action been suggested?
[02:34:58] <XCuteWitchX> I have to see a specialist which the closest one in a hour or two away.  Which it would be a big waste of time, I know. I've had a lot of problems with my eyes in which ive already seen 2 specialists and none of them knew anything it seems so not at the moment, no.
[02:35:33] <North> soft contact lenses would seem to be one early stage option
[02:35:48] <XCuteWitchX> The thing is, i'm squeamish about eyes in general.
[02:36:03] <North> I have a confession
[02:36:07] <XCuteWitchX> Including inserting things in my eye.. lol
[02:36:17] <North> understandably
[02:36:32] <North> it took me a bit to get used to putting contacts into my eyes
[02:36:40] <North> but now it's the easiest thing ever
[02:36:52] <North> I could touch my eyeballs all day long, no problem!
[02:37:29] <XCuteWitchX> Lol, just watching someone put or take out contacts gives me shivers.. yet needles I'm okay with haha.
[02:37:43] <North> you may surprise yourself, my friend
[02:38:15] <North> all a matter of acclimation, I suppose
[02:38:35] <XCuteWitchX> May be. I take it, we're the only ones here? lol.

[02:38:49] <CantSirDraggin> others may be lurking, heh

[02:40:36] <CantSirDraggin> the sleep thing doesn't sound like a bad idea, missed the bulk of my napping yesterday
[02:40:43] <North> sleep-interfering?
[02:41:15] <XCuteWitchX> That's a good idea, maybe i'll sleep it off :P
[02:41:17] <North> (eating late)
[02:41:33] <XCuteWitchX> No, I just know eating at night can gain weight on a person.

[03:40:15] <MissSugar> no i want my stomach to stop hurting
[03:40:19] <oath> well i think i've recently got on voodoo/necromancy
[03:40:55] <oath> and i was thinking that this death magick 
[03:40:58] <MissSugar> welp voodoo is not inherently dark, like any practice its what you do with it
[03:41:12] <DawnBat> Persoanlly I think necromancy is a no no

[03:41:47] <MissSugar> here some information on necromancy
[03:42:08] <North> wb Keiffer
[03:42:11] <oath> so then i thought there is a method i had read about ... that you can temorarlily kill a person and revive them - then i got to thinking about lusid dreaming and i was wondering do you think its possible to master death in this manner to learn its secrets
[03:42:31] <Keith> thanks north
[03:42:33] * DawnBat slumps and sighs
[03:42:36] <oath> and then i read a story about a necromancer apprentice who was killed by his master to know death
[03:42:41] <DawnBat> Georgia O'Keith?
[03:42:51] <Keith> huh?
[03:43:07] <DawnBat> It's a play on words
[03:43:11] <oath> and then i thought that maybe there is a way to expose yourself to death in a manner similiar to lusid dreaming
[03:43:15] <DawnBat> Georgia O'Keiffe
[03:43:24] <MissSugar> i am pretty sure you dont want to kill anyone
[03:43:25] <oath> and you can explore it through this
[03:43:30] <oath> absolutely not
[03:43:32] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> It's getting to where it's almost impossible to have a serious conversation in here.
[03:43:37] <oath> serious
[03:43:46] <XCuteWitchX> Part of it was my fault, Sorry ;)
[03:43:47] <MissSugar> good you can do a lot of time for that
[03:43:49] <DawnBat> ArchrWndrMcRbrt : I'm sometimes serious :P
[03:44:20] <XCuteWitchX> I can be serious for about 5 minutes.
[03:44:35] <MissSugar> i suggest you read up on that site it has a lot of information, but i will tell you one thing voodoo and necromancy are completely opposite of one another
[03:45:01] <MissSugar> necromancy does not respect the dead, voodoo does, if you try to pull the two together you are going to suffer for it

[03:45:10] <oath> hmm
[03:45:41] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Like walking near a bonfire while soaked in gasoline
[03:45:41] <DawnBat> isn't necromancy like forcefully having the dead work for you
[03:45:55] <oath> i thought it was like reaching out and communing with them
[03:46:13] <XCuteWitchX> But on a serious note, why would people want to corpse bother? It seems rather.... disturbing. (Yes, even to me of all people.)
[03:46:14] <MissSugar> if you want to reach out to the dead respectfully then build an altar to your ancestors
[03:46:16] <DawnBat> I've always seen necromancy as kinda dark an un-natural
[03:46:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That's mediumship, oath
[03:46:37] <oath> whats the point of sacrafice?

[03:47:51] <oath> what if they want something else...
[03:49:10] <MissSugar> do you kill your own food?
[03:49:13] <XCuteWitchX> And on this note, i'm going to just.. stay out of this topic lol.
[03:50:02] <oath> i have
[03:50:09] <MissSugar> do you do it regularly
[03:50:13] <oath> not anymore
[03:50:16] <MissSugar> then no 
[03:50:22] <oath> what?
[03:50:35] <DawnBat> The dead still (probably) have free-will so you can't force em
[03:50:39] <DawnBat> to do anything
[03:50:43] <MissSugar> those blood sacrifices are done by those who are in touch with the food they kill and eat

[03:51:22] <MissSugar> someone who is removed from that part of life should not sully it

[06:31:28] <DawnBat> it's estimated at 7,500 years old
[06:31:39] <DawnBat> http://www.andrewcollins.com/page/articles/carahunge.htm
[06:32:03] <Hrafnbjorn> thats gonna take a while to load... how did they date it?
[06:33:00] <raevynskyyemt> Nice
[06:33:08] <DawnBat> I can't find it.
[06:33:14] <DawnBat> I'd assume records or carbon dating
[06:33:35] <Hrafnbjorn> carbon dating only works on organics
[06:34:16] <DawnBat> Oh oops
[06:34:18] <Hrafnbjorn> the article says it was dated by runing the nagle of a hole through an astronomy program to see when it lined up with a specific star... not a very accurate way to date something
[06:34:26] <Hrafnbjorn> *angle
[06:34:53] <raevynskyyemt> It could line up with other stars too
[06:34:55] <DawnBat> huh
[06:35:12] <DawnBat> still ancient
[06:36:47] <DawnBat> nothing is as ancient as moi
[06:37:05] <Hrafnbjorn> moi?
[06:37:15] <DawnBat> me
[06:37:55] <DawnBat> was gonna say you but that'd be rude :p
[06:38:00] <Hrafnbjorn> I suspect that article is fueled by nationalism, unfortunatly...
[06:38:32] <DawnBat> possibly
[06:38:44] <DawnBat> a lotta articles say the same age though
[06:38:54] <Hrafnbjorn> which you find common with all of the ancient sites, whether the megaliths in Europe, or the temples in southern India
[06:39:19] <DawnBat> though the oldest religious site is in turkey yes?
[06:39:22] <Hrafnbjorn> oh, Im not trying to say the age is inaccurate, just that the article is suspect
[06:40:08] <Hrafnbjorn> anything from bronze age forward is different, and shows higher tool forming... so it is certainly pre-3000 bce I would assume
[06:40:46] <DawnBat> YEah

[06:45:18] <Hrafnbjorn> it, Varna, and the southern Indian ruins are the oldest, but anything getting to close to 10k bce is best left to the label of "old as dirt"
[06:46:02] <DawnBat> omfg
[06:46:15] <raevynskyyemt> What? 
[06:46:21] <Hrafnbjorn> and vry hard to prove... there is a fragmented section of Rig Veda that was dated to 7500 bce, which predates the standard beginning of writting, so its disregarded
[06:46:40] <DawnBat> Apparently they're gonna be digging into the Dino Exntinction Crater
[06:46:59] <Hrafnbjorn> both cause it goes against academics, but also because its extremely hard to prove anything that old
[06:47:25] <raevynskyyemt> Hraf that's before the bottleneck, I think. Who knows for sure if there was writing before? 
[06:48:44] <DawnBat> maybe Hrafnbjorn invented writing? O_O
[06:48:51] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed... I suspect that since our begining is based on the material it was written on, before we were working clay and stone, IF humans were writing before then, the evidence is long been fertilizer
[06:50:42] <Hrafnbjorn> so cuneiform, while not our earliest evidence of writing, is just the oldest we can translate (even then its shakey translations), but there is evidence of writing way before it, we just can translate it, nor can we prove it was done for sake of writing
[06:51:04] <DawnBat> intriguing
[06:51:07] <Hrafnbjorn> and since it is written in clay, that evidence lasted the ages
[06:51:25] <DawnBat> Deimotic looks cooler :P
[06:52:14] <raevynskyyemt> The drawings in the caves could be some sort of writing. Not art. Or maybe both
[06:52:22] <DawnBat> wait
[06:52:29] <DawnBat> Demotic is the ancestor of Arabic yes?
[06:52:41] <raevynskyyemt> I don't know DawnBat
[06:52:44] <Hrafnbjorn> not to mentioin that before it can be deemed a writing system, it has to have evidence it was wide spread, and uniform... runes for example are not a full written language becuase it was never formulized into uniformity
[06:53:21] <Hrafnbjorn> runes are in no way in the running for the old writting though, just using it as an example
[06:54:29] <raevynskyyemt> Ogham would be a better example maybe? 
[06:54:58] <raevynskyyemt> I'm not sure I spelled that right
[06:55:10] <Hrafnbjorn> dunno... its in same boat as runes in many ways.  Ogham is older, but like runes it was not uniform
[06:56:00] <Hrafnbjorn> with runes we have the advantage that they become more popular in the early Christian period than the Heathen period, so more was preserved
[06:56:56] *** Quits: DawnBat (IceChat9@sorcery-jgnukr.client.bresnan.net) (Quit: ASCII a stupid question, get a stupid ANSI!)
[06:57:37] <raevynskyyemt> Because of the similarities with Latin letters, I assume 
[06:57:53] <Hrafnbjorn> by the Christian period Old Norse was the norm though, so there was uniform spelling, and they had a concept of grammar... durung the runic period there was no grammar at all, and spelling was all over the place... for exmple, during the runic period the f sound could be represented with the f rune, the b rune, or the p rune
[06:58:06] <Hrafnbjorn> *during
[06:58:59] <Hrafnbjorn> the f rune could also represent the English v sound (or German w), but so could the u rune
[06:59:11] <Hrafnbjorn> so runes were terrible for writing

[07:00:58] <Hrafnbjorn> not to mention that almost half of the examples of runes we have left to day have not been translated yet, cause they are often written in codes, and we have not unlocked all of the codes yet
[07:01:59] <Hrafnbjorn> the most common things it would seem folk wrote about with runes is as grave markers, or to profess love, or just to say "I wrote these runes"

[07:03:04] <raevynskyyemt> Or as place claims

[07:04:26] <raevynskyyemt> In the Americas I mean
[07:05:36] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm, the first settlements in North America were on the channel islands off California, was not until the early 1500's that folk started settling the continent (except in Meso America)

[07:15:51] <Hrafnbjorn> volcanos are scary
[07:16:53] <Hrafnbjorn> there are several in the mountains around here, and you can drive around, and find chunks of rock thrown out of them as big as houses... imagine being in the field when those were falling
[07:17:00] <DawnBat> they're terryfyung to me

[07:18:19] <DawnBat> unless you're like some beach on the East Coast
[07:18:35] <Hrafnbjorn> I remember whe St. Helens blew up in Washington state, we had an inch of ash way down in the middle of California
[07:18:51] <Hrafnbjorn> that wouldnt help, DawnBat

[07:19:14] <Hrafnbjorn> you may not die right away, but we will all die form it (unless we are on mars or somethin)
[07:19:14] <DawnBat> well actually
[07:19:32] <DawnBat> MOST of the U.S and (Canada?) would be drowned in ash
[07:19:42] <DawnBat> Then global weater patterns would be altered for decades

[07:21:10] <DawnBat> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419372/
[07:21:12] <raevynskyyemt> It all depends on how severe the eruption is

[07:33:42] <Hrafnbjorn> how do you guys observe, or celebrate holidays?
[07:33:57] <DawnBat> I haven't exactly yet
[07:34:10] <DawnBat> There's too many Kemetic ones. Realy only one seems the biggest atm
[07:34:35] <raevynskyyemt> I don't celebrate holidays really 
[07:35:46] <raevynskyyemt> Halloween would be the one that would be biggest for me if I did though 
[07:35:56] <raevynskyyemt> Err samhakn
[07:36:00] <raevynskyyemt> Samhain even
[07:36:03] <Hrafnbjorn> I suppose, being Heathen, I am a little lucky with holidays cause many of the holidays we still observe came from Heathenism (Yule, Easter, Veterans Day etc) and the way we celbrate them comes form Heathenism too
[07:36:26] <Hrafnbjorn> but I rarely celebrate the holidays
[07:36:49] <raevynskyyemt> I thought veterans day came from armistice day. The end of ww1
[07:36:52] <DawnBat> I want to celeberate Wep Ronpet this year.
[07:37:33] <Hrafnbjorn> I doubt we preserved the holiday directly from Heathenism, but it was practiced on same general day
[07:37:50] <raevynskyyemt> Huh. Didn't know that 
[07:38:02] <Hrafnbjorn> we did preserve Yule and Easter directly though, just changed the reason for them
[07:38:29] <Hrafnbjorn> and reduced Yule from 12 nights to 1 of course
[07:38:34] <raevynskyyemt> That I did know
[07:39:45] <Hrafnbjorn> some of the neo-Heathen sects, such as Asatru have gone a bit out of control with holidays... every historic Scandinavian figure has a holiday
[07:40:18] <raevynskyyemt> Lol. Kind of like ancient Greece and Rome 
[07:41:07] <Hrafnbjorn> like I really want to celbrate Erik the Red... he was outlawed in 2 countries for murder, yet modern Heathens celbrate him :(

[07:44:21] <Hrafnbjorn> so.... Star Wars :)
[07:44:35] <Hrafnbjorn> I finally watched the new one a couple days ago
[07:44:45] <raevynskyyemt> What did you think? 
[07:45:09] <DawnBat> II haven't seen it
[07:45:37] <Hrafnbjorn> I liked it... I didnt like the main actress though, seemd to me like she overacted... plus there were some scenes that were a little too scripted, but overal I though it was great
[07:46:22] <Hrafnbjorn> plus there is a trend with female heros that bugs the poo out of me
[07:46:26] <raevynskyyemt> I liked to too 
[07:46:41] <raevynskyyemt> Why does it bug you? 
[07:46:43] <DawnBat> and there's no female Norse heroes Hrafnbjorn?
[07:47:16] <Hrafnbjorn> there are many
[07:47:25] <Hrafnbjorn> its not them being female that bugs me
[07:47:34] <Hrafnbjorn> its a certain pattern
[07:47:40] <Hrafnbjorn> when a male is gonna be a hero, he has to go through a bunch of training... when its a female, she ends up being more powerful than the trained males as soon as she realizs her power
[07:47:41] <DawnBat> ah
[07:47:58] <DawnBat> ah
[07:48:22] <Hrafnbjorn> if a person needs training, they need training, male or female is irrelivent, except in how we are portraying them
[07:48:54] <raevynskyyemt> I see your point. Luke was more powerful than other jedi. Yes he needed training. But not a decade or more like others that came before 
[07:49:18] <Hrafnbjorn> like in the show Arrow... one of the females decided one day she was gonna learn boxing, as soon as she took it up, she was beating the crap out of all the bad guys... just too hard to believe IMO
[07:49:23] <raevynskyyemt> But rey does seem more powerful than him. Or maybe she's just more confident 
[07:49:55] <DawnBat> Jar Jar should've been the hero of Force Awakens
[07:49:59] <raevynskyyemt> Yeah. Laurel did pick up being black canary too fast. And Thea picked it up too fast as well
[07:50:34] <Hrafnbjorn> I dunno who is whom from that show, I just remember seeing a couple episodes
[07:50:59] <raevynskyyemt> Thea is Olivers sister. Laurel is his ex girlfriend
[07:51:05] <raevynskyyemt> If that helps 
[07:52:18] <Hrafnbjorn> but, there is a reason why the combat martial arts have the concept of male and female methods... although its not totaly gender based, females have a more effective way to fight (based on their physiology) than the typical masculine method

[08:01:40] <raevynskyyemt> I missed that
[08:02:22] <Hrafnbjorn> my fav thing is that they brought the old characters back, and they at least tried to make it feel like the originals... the middle 3 didnt even feel like Star Wars to me... 
[08:02:28] <raevynskyyemt> Anyway. That was probably my favorite. Though reys secret is driving me crazy. I don't want to wait to find out how wrong I am

[08:06:49] <AntleredGirl> And Hrafnbjorn 
[08:07:08] <Iona> Jackie Chan is all stage fighting... 
[08:08:10] <Iona> He's not fighting to hurt, he's fighting to tell a story
[08:08:57] <Hrafnbjorn> JC did make some wonderful movies though... Spiritual Kung Fu is among my favorites
[08:09:05] <AntleredGirl> Drunken Master. 
[08:09:08] <AntleredGirl> <33
[08:09:13] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[08:09:33] <raevynskyyemt> Can't remember the name right now. The one with Owen Wilson 
[08:09:42] <AntleredGirl> Shanghai Noon.
[08:09:44] <Hrafnbjorn> Jet  Li actualy has a very hard time with the choreography cause he has to slow way down
[08:09:50] <raevynskyyemt> Yes. Thanks 
[08:10:03] <AntleredGirl> :D
[08:10:51] <Iona> I hate to say it, but I loved the choreography of Kill Bill 1
[08:11:18] <Hrafnbjorn> of course Gordon Liu helped with it :)
[08:11:43] <Iona> Yes :)
[08:11:48] <raevynskyyemt> Did you see the video where they added lights ayers? 
[08:11:53] <raevynskyyemt> Sabers
[08:12:18] <Hrafnbjorn> he was in my all time fav kung fu movie... Master Killer (aka 36th Chamber of Shaolin) about the monk that invented the 3-section staff
[08:12:27] <Hrafnbjorn> no I dont think I did see it
[08:12:58] <Iona> Gordon Liu is excellent in it...
[08:13:06] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed

[08:13:27] <raevynskyyemt> If you're interesed
[08:13:31] <Iona> The personality of the beard stroking alone...
[08:13:38] <Hrafnbjorn> I cant load youtube :(
[08:13:42] <raevynskyyemt> In your case hraf when you get to good wifi
[08:13:50] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[08:14:25] <raevynskyyemt> Hishe edited the sabers in and changed some of the subtitles to fit
[08:14:50] <Hrafnbjorn> Kill Bill was supposed to be in part about paying respect to some of the old school actors and movies, but the ones they singled out (Gordon Liu and Sonny Chiba) actualy felt offended by it, even though both were in it

[08:15:22] <raevynskyyemt> Probably because it's about a team of assassins 
[08:15:39] <raevynskyyemt> I don't see martial arts practitioners being happy with that part 
[08:16:03] <Hrafnbjorn> anyone who has seen Sonny Chiba's Hattori Hanzo characted form Kage No Gundan would understand why it bothered him
[08:16:53] <Iona> The ethics are too westernized?
[08:17:05] <Hrafnbjorn> dunno
[08:17:36] <Hrafnbjorn> in Kage No Gundan Hanzo was a badass, and in Kill Bill he was kind of a novelty
[08:18:51] <Iona> True...
[08:18:57] <Hrafnbjorn> plus ALL of the Hattori Hanzo's were high ranking samurai, not swordsmiths.  In Kage No Gundan it is implied he was disguising himself as a bath-house owner
[08:19:15] <Iona> Hmmm....
[08:19:50] <Hrafnbjorn> Hanzo was just the title to whichever samurai was in charge of the Hattori clan
[08:20:26] <Iona> Bushido was better exemplified in the other roles I think...
[08:20:31] <Hrafnbjorn> the last Hanzo also left us a winderful shinboi book :)
[08:20:42] * Iona smiles
[08:20:45] <Iona> That's good

[08:22:11] <Hrafnbjorn> my favorite character for Sonny Chiba is his portrayal of Yagyu Jubei in "Yagyu Jubei Aberatabe" and "Samurai Rssurection"
[08:22:34] <Hrafnbjorn> but I am bias, Jubei is one of my favorite historical characters period

[08:23:16] <Abraxas> Welcome, raevynskkyyemt. Enlightenment doesn't occur from sitting around visualizing images of light, but from integrating the darker aspects of the self into the conscious personality.
[08:23:41] <raevynskkyyemt> Had to plug in the phone. It was complaining about its bsttery
[08:23:55] <Iona> :)
[08:24:31] <Hrafnbjorn> Miyamoto Musashi avoided all of the Yagyu's like they had the plague, cause he had 3 friendly bouts with the elder Yagyu Sekkishusai, and lost all 3... and Sekkishusai was an unarmed old man at the time, lol... so Musashi figured the other 2 famous Yagyu's owuld be too much for him

[08:24:53] <raevynskkyyemt> Ty
[08:26:43] <Hrafnbjorn> plus, Musashi had contact with a Zen monk that was tight with the Yagyu's, and he probably warned Musashi that the Yagyu's were killers
[08:26:55] <Hrafnbjorn> especialy Jubei
[08:28:32] <Hrafnbjorn> Jubei's father Munenori was the kenjutsu instructor for the shogun, but also controled the oniwaban (assassins) and shinobi (spies) rings... Jubei got bent out of shape over osme of the unethical uses of them, so he traveled around killing all his dads assassins and spies... nobody knows just how many he slayed, but its in the hundreds
[08:30:14] <Hrafnbjorn> ugh, I hate rodeo season... when rodeo is coming, thats all ya here about here
[08:30:24] <Iona> That's simultaneously awesome and awe inspiring...
[08:30:41] <Hrafnbjorn> I agree
[08:30:53] <Iona> He out-assassined so many assassins...
[08:32:27] <Hrafnbjorn> chances are, he had help... we know he lived with the Negoro shinobi, who were part of the Iga shinobi, for a long time, so he may have had their help
[08:33:51] <Iona> Relationships matter...
[08:34:07] <Hrafnbjorn> especialy good relationships :)
[08:35:58] <Iona> :)
[08:38:56] <raevynskkyyemt> Yep
[08:40:55] * Hrafnbjorn yawns... I seem to have run out of ramble fuel, lol
[08:41:06] <raevynskkyyemt> It's alright

[17:34:43] <Babebarian> there are stories though about heroes going to her for advice and power
[17:35:12] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> She especially liked dining on rude and disrespectful children.

[17:36:57] <Babebarian> so I'm debating if I want to go

[17:38:00] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, I would say the learning possibilities are worth the trip.
[17:38:14] <Babebarian> Yeah...that's what I've been thinking
[17:38:59] <SpiritSong> she wont hurt you Babebarian
[17:39:14] <Babebarian> You don't think?
[17:39:17] <SpiritSong> simply talking is harmless
[17:39:22] <SpiritSong> i dont think so no
[17:39:26] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I would go into it like any situation where I know nothing, and am dealing with those who do. I'd keep my eyes and ears and mind open, and my mouth closed, unless spoken to.
[17:39:28] <Babebarian> it's when you get more involved 
[17:39:31] <Babebarian> yeah
[17:39:41] <SpiritSong> i dont see why she would have reason to hurt you
[17:40:10] <Babebarian> Yeah I don't think she would...I guess in the back of my mind
[17:40:19] <Babebarian> this could be the beginning of a great adventure 
[17:40:23] <SpiritSong> the ledgends niggling at you?
[17:40:25] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, unless she is actually fae, and not just a witch, she's been dust for a long time.

[17:41:19] <Babebarian> but I mean, making that jump to heroics

[19:21:08] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, someone came up with these cute little stuffed alligators wearing a shirt with a man in a business suit on it.

[19:55:28] <SpiritSong> what was thr story?
[19:55:43] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> There was an actor, a long y=time ago. Quite well known in his day, he was. 
[19:56:44] <SpiritSong> nods
[19:56:49] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> One day,he and a younger actor were discussing a criticism of a performance they had given. The younger actor said, "Well, I gues you have to ignore the bad reviews, huh?"
[19:57:14] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The older actor replied, "Dear boy, you must also ignore the good ones."
[19:58:47] * SpiritSong listens
[19:59:24] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> That's it. Simple, yes?
[19:59:39] <SpiritSong> very

[20:37:36] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> No worries
[20:38:08] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I can't remember the last time I went to see a stage play.
[20:39:17] <SpiritSong> i think my last time was in school
[20:40:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Wait, it was back in 1998. My g/f's younger sister was in her High School's production of "Sherlock Holnes", based on, the exploits of ...  well, you know who.
[20:41:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Holmes
[20:42:12] <SpiritSong> was it good?
[20:45:55] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> For what it was, yes. Some of the kids were very good, a few were "adequate".
[20:46:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Some were actors only in the sense that they called themselves that, but were rather wooden.
[20:47:18] <SpiritSong> aww hehe
[20:47:24] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Fortunately, those were the background folk, and not up front.
[20:47:27] <SpiritSong> but its cool they were brave enough to get on stage
[20:47:33] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yup
[20:47:43] <SpiritSong> hehe auditions sort that out
[20:51:04] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> As a rule. If the school is smaller, the Drama director may have to take whoever he can get.
[20:56:51] <SpiritSong> thi is true
