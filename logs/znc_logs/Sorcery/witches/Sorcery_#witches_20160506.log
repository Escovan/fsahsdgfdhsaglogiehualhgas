[03:40:25] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I liked it, myelf. I was a bit shocked they killed off Han, but overall, I liked it.

[03:59:19] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Hey, Hrafnbjorn
[03:59:23] <Hrafnbjorn> whats the topic??
[03:59:38] <North> badly animated tv shows
[03:59:53] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Old TV shows, and movies that were so bad they were good
[03:59:59] <North> such as 'Hercules' and 'Rocket Robin Hood'
[04:00:23] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Such as "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes"
[04:00:47] <Hrafnbjorn> hhmm.... ever see "The Last Dragon"?  Its a way cheasy martial arts movie, but really good in its cheese
[04:01:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yup, it was
[04:02:52] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Some of the ones from the early 70's, like "Five Fingers Of Death"
[04:03:18] <Hrafnbjorn> I grew up watching those, lol
[04:04:07] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I was working at a theatre in 1972, and on afternoon, we had a private showing for a martial arts school, and they were all laughing their butts off at most of it.
[04:05:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The scene where a guy tosses a rock in the air, and when it's coming down, jabs upward with his fingers and powderizes it.
[04:05:50] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah... the Chinese martial arts evolved with a theatrical aspect, so its no real surprise that they would be so .... theatrical, and humerous
[04:07:34] <Hrafnbjorn> and you can tell in movies which actor trained in a theatrical art, like with Jackie Chan, or a combat oriented, like Gordon Liu, or Bruce Lee... the of ocurse Jet Li is trained in all of them, since that was his official govt sponsored job
[04:08:23] <Hrafnbjorn> not to knock Jackie Chan, cause his movies are great
[04:09:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Oh, yeah. If I was forced to choose between those guys, no choice but to fight one, it would be Jackie before Gordon or Jet.
[04:10:49] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I'd still get my butt kicked, but it would likely be less painful and damaging.
[04:10:58] <Hrafnbjorn> and cant forget a mention for Chuck Norris, he was a BA in his day
[04:11:12] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> True statement\
[04:11:29] <Hrafnbjorn> He and my teacher ran a female full contact team together for a while

[04:12:04] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> There were some great martial artists from here, like Mike Stone and Bill Wallace, but Norris is about the best.

[04:19:11] <Hrafnbjorn> my only complain about American made ones, which is more a sighn of our culture, is how we make the hero figure too good, and without the theatrics in Chinese ones, it makes it hard to take

[04:19:25] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Aye
[04:20:29] <Hrafnbjorn> It goes the other way too though, Japanese movies tend to over fucus on the heroes weaknesses and faults
[04:20:36] <Hrafnbjorn> *focus
[04:21:17] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> "The Street Fighter", which was more of an "anti-hero" type story

[04:21:40] <Hrafnbjorn> But hey base most of theirs on historic characters, with well known reputations
[04:21:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Yup
[04:22:14] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah he Street Fighter movies were perfect examples
[04:23:05] <Hrafnbjorn> Sonny Chiba seemed to like that anti-hero mask, most of his popular characters were only 'good' guys cause the story is about them, lol
[04:24:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Aye
[04:27:06] <Hrafnbjorn> I started the layout for a woodburning project for Widders today
[04:27:45] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I have no doubt she's gonna be pleased with the final product.
[04:27:53] <MissSugar> its gonna be good
[04:28:14] <Hrafnbjorn> same 2 raven as the other one, but ots on a rectangle plaque, has knotwork corners in top right, and bottom left, now gotta aske her if she wants any kind of text to fill the other corners
[04:28:44] <Hrafnbjorn> ots=knots
[04:28:49] <MissSugar> i want to see pictures when its done
[04:28:58] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[04:30:07] <Hrafnbjorn> layout is the easy part though, once ya start burning, ya cant exactly erase I guess, so I could still mess up, lol
[04:30:25] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> True enough
[04:31:21] <MissSugar> but you can always add to the mess up like it was suppose to be there

[19:52:09] <AntleredGirl> TheAllison: Are you hanging out here now? 
[19:52:13] <TheAllison> aye
[19:52:36] <AntleredGirl> All I saw was the last post thing when someone tried to see when you were last there.
[19:52:47] <AntleredGirl> I was a bit...taken aback, but glad to see you here. :D
[19:52:59] * TheAllison shrugs
[19:53:32] * AntleredGirl offers a cookie? 
[19:53:43] <TheAllison> It's been a long time coming tbh. Newf letting pomegranate back on the network was the last straw
[19:54:11] <AntleredGirl> I don't really know what happened but seeing her back was a BIG surprise
[19:54:33] <TheAllison> right?
[19:54:48] <AntleredGirl> I thought she had sworn that place off.
[19:55:29] <AntleredGirl> BUT whatever now; that's someone else's drama from now on
[19:55:34] <TheAllison> she was only there to get to me. she started harassing me in PM and subtly fat shaming in the main channel as soon as newf reversed the ban I had set for ban evading
[19:55:53] * AntleredGirl sighs
[19:55:59] <TheAllison> Yeah, newf banned me after I deoped and walked XD
[19:56:48] <AntleredGirl> o.o
[19:58:07] <TheAllison> probably had something to do with me coming clean to Amira about having an affair with newf.... and sending her her own nudes (courtesy of newf) as proof.... yes, it was done out of spite. been keeping that secret since before I was even modded there. XD
[19:58:30] <North> wow
[19:58:34] <AntleredGirl> Oh...uh...wow. 
[19:58:34] * TheAllison shrugs
[19:59:02] <TheAllison> he's silly tbh, bans can't keep me out EVEN IF I wanted to be there, a VPN is a click of a button away.

[20:00:33] <TheAllison> He flipped out on me over Skype, he called me a evil psycho C U N * in one breath and in the very next threatened to open a multi-national cyber bullying case against me XD

[20:00:48] <AntleredGirl> Wow.
[20:02:12] <TheAllison> It's been a very revealing road to truth this has, I never realized just how much of a predator he is, he uses a religiously centered chat room to come onto anything with tits.
[20:02:42] <TheAllison> This is one of the things almost any crafting book warns you against when contemplating joining any kind of religious group.

[23:26:51] <SpiritSong> things change from day to day even then
[23:26:58] <SpiritSong> exactly!!!!1

[23:50:27] <SpiritSong> no idea
[23:50:49] <SpiritSong> i dobt think humanity is capable of following rules without reprucussuon
[23:51:29] <SpiritSong> rules set by overnemtn will be there to benifit the governments, not the people
[23:51:40] <SpiritSong> i dont have a very sunny view of humanity :)
