[02:59:27] <CircleReverse> today I told someone that crazy is such a relative term...
[02:59:37] <BansheeTears> That it is
[02:59:37] <CircleReverse> that they would have to prove that they're crazier than someone else.
[02:59:43] <MissSugar> ok Trump
[02:59:48] <CircleReverse> ...which is in itself crazy.

[04:41:41] <Alaren> ahh, yes, that stupid rail. It's still there.
[04:41:44] <CantSirDraggin> i'm on the fence on it
[04:42:02] <CantSirDraggin> looked like a decent rail to me
[04:42:15] <Alaren> well, it's certainly railevant, in your defence
[04:42:24] * CantSirDraggin nods
[04:42:59] <CantSirDraggin> being in an apt complex, that's more home improvement than i've done in years
[04:43:25] <CantSirDraggin> did the place with the creepy ass dungeon room ever sell?
[04:44:34] <Alyria> Almost - we actually might be in contract in a few days
[04:44:46] <Alyria> A lady who can't get up and down stairs so well.
[04:44:52] <Alyria> (no joke.)
[04:45:04] <CantSirDraggin> this other place keeps telling me that there's a lot of kink events in that area....might make it a sales point, js
[04:46:16] <CantSirDraggin> not sure why columbus would be a hotbed, but it is what it is
[04:52:29] * Alyria shrugs
[04:52:55] <Alyria> High Catholic population, I'm guessing.
[04:53:05] <CantSirDraggin> maybe
[04:53:16] <CantSirDraggin> i may be in the wrong faith, considering
[04:53:30] <Alyria> haha
[04:53:45] <Alyria> Those skirts alone...
[04:53:53] <CantSirDraggin> not sure funerals that last forever is a fair trade off though
[04:55:21] <Alyria> Not just funerals...I've been to the Catholic trifecta. Wedding, funeral, and a baptism.
[04:55:22] <CantSirDraggin> nm that i'm not exactly pagan of my own free will
[04:56:13] <CantSirDraggin> wasn't any prt of that triumverate that showed up in my 'hour of need'
[04:56:58] <CantSirDraggin> not exactly sure what it was that did, but i can't but help to go by what it says she was
[04:58:57] <CantSirDraggin> all i've read of the god of abraham says it would have never heppened like that if it were him though, so f--- it
[04:59:18] * CircleReverse smiles...

[05:27:40] <CantSirDraggin> so this weekend it's a study of karma as its own seperate force
[05:28:42] <CantSirDraggin> in general if i can feel it, i can nail it, so i hope this will be as well
[05:29:44] <Alyria> Night, friends.
[05:29:56] <MissSugar> have a good night Alyria 
[05:30:00] <CantSirDraggin> sweet dreams Alyria and Alaren
[05:30:34] <CantSirDraggin> evening MissSugar
[05:31:07] <CircleReverse> CantSirDraggin: karma as its own separate force...  a good subject...
[05:31:16] <CantSirDraggin> it is what it is
[05:31:34] <CircleReverse> As I understand it, it's relevant to emergent energies...  
[05:31:55] <CircleReverse> there is a pattern from what I've been observing...
[05:32:10] <CantSirDraggin> the law of three is a dumbed down version of intended unseen and unintended consequence
[05:32:41] <CantSirDraggin> a good law for the unfocused, to be sure
[05:34:19] <CantSirDraggin> x3 what you may forsee is a good starting point anyway
[05:35:04] <CircleReverse> yes...  
[05:35:06] <CantSirDraggin> but to feel it seperately is another subject, and i'm not convinced if i got it or no
[05:35:33] <CantSirDraggin> tonight drunk, but this has been an ongoing topic for me
[05:35:36] <CircleReverse> good luck ^^  
[05:36:04] <CantSirDraggin> not sure if that was a pun or not, lol

[05:37:00] <CircleReverse> no, it's no pun...
[05:37:35] <CantSirDraggin> nods
[05:37:40] <CircleReverse> from what I can see...  whether I'm in a state of other-selfness or not, karma still follows...  
[05:38:21] <CantSirDraggin> i do get the end of how far down i can go from here, and have financially prepared, and stashed several diff places, banked and hidden
[05:38:39] <CircleReverse> karma, because it's ever-changing, may very well be an emergent phenomena...
[05:38:53] <CantSirDraggin> a seperae force i still say
[05:39:01] <CantSirDraggin> nm the typo
[05:39:04] * CircleReverse smiles...
[05:39:21] <CantSirDraggin> think of a record needle on a sheet of rubber
[05:39:40] * CircleReverse listens...
[05:40:00] <CantSirDraggin> here and there it just pulls, and here and there it contracts back to what you would assume to be natural
[05:40:14] <CantSirDraggin> sometimes it just pulls and pulls
[05:40:23] <CantSirDraggin> why asshats get away with it
[05:40:55] <CircleReverse> ...and others do not...
[05:41:02] <CantSirDraggin> sometimes it gives in an exciting manner, which may be darwinism or just seemingly good peeps getting hell
[05:41:38] <CantSirDraggin> as a seperate force some peeps feel less resonate it seems though
[05:41:51] <CantSirDraggin> in a minor undertaking of the thing
[05:42:08] <CircleReverse> Well, in my perspective, I would have to approach it from the perspective of aggregate personal experience...  
[05:43:01] <CantSirDraggin> i've done much the same, but balance seems to be lacking
[05:43:17] <CircleReverse> balance as in a stable place to stand?
[05:43:25] <CircleReverse> or balance as in equiamity?...
[05:43:45] <CantSirDraggin> anything equal would need a timeline to look at
[05:43:53] * CircleReverse nods...
[05:43:55] <CantSirDraggin> which is another trick
[05:44:34] <CantSirDraggin> there are def tools to create an equilibrium for another, but you get the same in return, and it's hella hard to see where you stand

[05:53:21] <CircleReverse> kudos on picking a fairly random password though
[05:53:21] <Willow_FairChild> That's not even my password lmao
[05:53:36] <CantSirDraggin> looked good and random
[05:53:49] <Willow_FairChild> Yes, CantSirDraggin , because I could totally remember that when I can't even remember where my socks are. :|
[05:53:55] <Willow_FairChild> It was just the confirmation code
[05:54:37] <CantSirDraggin> your socks are and never will be any of my biz  :P
[05:54:46] <Willow_FairChild> The dryer eats them. 
[05:54:53] <CantSirDraggin> i assume them to be nearish stl
[05:54:56] <Willow_FairChild> That's what the dryer lint is. Cremated remains of my socks.
[05:55:20] <CantSirDraggin> rip, poor socks
[05:55:40] <Willow_FairChild> Yeah. poor wallet. I have to replace them.

[05:57:25] <CantSirDraggin> those were long ago, heh
[05:57:46] <CantSirDraggin> not attending, invite or no, but best of luck to yall
[05:57:52] <Willow_FairChild> We set the date, and we're actually trying to get our ducks in a row. I will NOT be wearing white, nor will it be "Traditional" Bwahahahaha
[05:58:13] <CantSirDraggin> stl is not close, heh

[05:58:35] <CantSirDraggin> also, got a move to abq in the works
[05:58:49] <CantSirDraggin> a lot less close to be sure
[05:59:28] * Willow_FairChild has two bookshelves on registery.....
[05:59:34] <Willow_FairChild> Think he'll notice? xD
[06:00:48] <CantSirDraggin> no idea
[06:01:15] <CantSirDraggin> you having two of my balls didn't matter, so i guess it wont' either
[06:03:08] <Willow_FairChild> I has them CantSirDraggin , and I even threatened to poison someone over them. They are sitting comfortably on my bookshelf, but the balls want their own bookselves, so they knock my moonstones down and throw them around and bully them. So they get their own bookshelves. xD
[06:03:23] <CantSirDraggin> lol
[06:04:24] <CantSirDraggin> maybe need a lead lined box if you want to silence them, but not sure if that would help
[06:05:09] <CantSirDraggin> but few tools will challenge them as it is
[06:05:50] <Willow_FairChild> They're fine as long as their on seperate shelves. Unfortunately....I'm running out of shelf room with the massive amounts of tarot cards I now own. xD
[06:06:03] <Willow_FairChild> I couldn't stop. They were so pretty, and shiny, and omg I want another deck.\
