[05:05:41] <Hrafnbjorn> ya mean connected it to my amazon acct? yeah
[05:06:26] <SpiritSong> coool
[05:06:44] <SpiritSong> is it better than the previous kindle
[05:07:07] <SpiritSong> i prefeer the plain olde kindle myself. ill only go online with a kindle fire
[05:07:31] <Hrafnbjorn> um, I kinda like the paper white better, except that I got a couple language learning apps for the fire, which ya cant get for the paperwhite
[05:08:06] <SpiritSong> thats pretty cool
[05:08:11] <SpiritSong> whats languages
[05:09:17] <Hrafnbjorn> one is for Japanese, the other is a translator that you can either type, or speak... plus you can take photo of signs or labels, and it will translate them for ya... it works for 50 languages I think

[05:12:59] <SpiritSong> yeah it isnt a kindle without the paper white really
[05:13:09] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[05:13:31] <DawnBat> I apologize, I am still trying to wake up
[05:13:45] <Hrafnbjorn> touch screen stuff drives me nuts to be honest... I just get a finger close and it acts like I touched it
[05:14:16] <DawnBat> it's cause you have a strong bio-electric field :P
[05:14:49] <Hrafnbjorn> somethin
[05:15:01] <SpiritSong> oober sensitive screens are a pain
[05:15:07] <DawnBat> touch screens cannot handle the epicness that is Hrafnbjorn
[05:15:15] <Hrafnbjorn> lol
[05:16:01] <Hrafnbjorn> its just sceered of the spear... it knows if it misbehaves I will spear it, so it jumps the gun to keep me appeased ;)
[05:16:06] <DawnBat> xD
[05:16:22] <Hrafnbjorn> kidding of course
[05:16:29] <DawnBat> I charged my kindle last night bit have been too lazy to use it
[05:16:58] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Took the quiz, SpiritSong. Posted it on Fb.
[05:17:15] <DawnBat> now sifting through youtube bored outta my mind
[05:17:16] <SpiritSong> it doesnt show your score archy, what did you get
[05:18:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> 100
[05:18:26] <SpiritSong> nice!!!
[05:18:29] <SpiritSong> i only got 80
[05:18:45] <DawnBat> that's spooky. I was thinking of 100. Probably a coincidence
[05:18:56] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> pROBABLY
[05:19:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> oops
[05:19:05] <DawnBat> :P
[05:19:20] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> hit lock instead of shift by accident
[05:19:27] <DawnBat> Doesn't help that earlier this week I predicted a ladies babies gender and was right
[05:20:01] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Nothing wrong with being a bit of a precog, DawnBat
[05:20:27] <SpiritSong> nice DawnBat
[05:20:50] <DawnBat> :3
[05:21:03] <DawnBat> oh gosh
[05:21:13] <Hrafnbjorn> did you know if you take a pin, or pencil, or something similar, draw 4 lines on piece of paper all as far apart as the pin is long, you can predict how many time it will cross a line when you drop the pin?
[05:21:17] <DawnBat> So I went to bed art 1:17 PM or and just woke up a bit ago.
[05:21:34] <MissSugar> just keep trusting your gut instinct and you can refine that
[05:21:53] <Hrafnbjorn> it will work out to pi
[05:22:04] <DawnBat> The universe is spooky
[05:22:50] <DawnBat> fun video on YouTube " Adam and Eve in The FriendZone "
[05:22:53] <SpiritSong> :p
[05:23:05] <Hrafnbjorn> you can also know either the straight line distance between a river source and the end, or know the total length with curves and such with pi as well
[05:23:57] <Hrafnbjorn> rivers always work out to straight.length/total.length=pi
[05:24:15] <DawnBat> Math makes my brain hurt xD
[05:24:16] <SpiritSong> cool
[05:24:21] <Hrafnbjorn> so divide the total length by the straight length, and the answer wil be pi, lol
[05:24:28] <SpiritSong> wow
[05:24:33] <SpiritSong> thats amazing 
[05:24:34] <SpiritSong> lol
[05:24:57] <DawnBat> My question is, why is the universe so spooky like that.
[05:24:58] <MissSugar> dont worry dawn i am in that boat with you
[05:25:03] <DawnBat> ^
[05:25:04] <DawnBat> xD
[05:25:28] * DawnBat starts to sing "Sailing"
[05:25:33] <SpiritSong> i dont understand math but it can be pretty amazing
[05:25:36] <MissSugar> if people only knew how little i understood math it would be embarrassing 
[05:25:48] <DawnBat> gurllllll
[05:25:53] <DawnBat> I can barely subtract
[05:25:55] <DawnBat> no joke
[05:26:02] <Hrafnbjorn> sorry, I was reading earlier about #'s that occur more often than they should... like the fibunachi (sp?) #'s and how spirals, and flower petals are almlmst always onw of the fibunachi #s
[05:26:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> MATH is the meaning of life, SpiritSong

[05:26:48] <SpiritSong> Hrafnbjorn what does fibunachi mean
[05:26:50] <SpiritSong> hi ForestFox
[05:26:53] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa ForestFox!
[05:26:56] <DawnBat> Fibonacci
[05:26:56] <MissSugar> hey ForestFox 
[05:26:57] <ForestFox> Hi SpiritSong  and Hrafnbjorn 
[05:27:02] <ForestFox> Hey MissSugar 
[05:27:09] <DawnBat> surprisingly I know fibonacci somewhat xD
[05:27:34] <ForestFox> A series of numbers
[05:27:38] <SpiritSong> nods
[05:27:39] <MissSugar> Fibonacci is a sequence of numbers that are constantly adding up out into a spiral
[05:27:41] * ForestFox hides
[05:27:44] <SpiritSong> ahhh
[05:27:48] <ForestFox> Ahh
[05:27:50] <ForestFox> Thought so
[05:27:58] <Hrafnbjorn> it is a number sequence where starting with 1, you add the new one with the previous, so they are 1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5 etc....
[05:28:02] <DawnBat> ^
[05:28:02] <MissSugar> its seen in nature quite a bit
[05:28:14] <SpiritSong> nods
[05:28:18] <DawnBat> Fibonacci was devised though by a sheep farmer to count sheep I believe
[05:28:21] <Hrafnbjorn> so, 1,2,3,5,8,13,21....
[05:28:40] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> M is the 13th letter of the alphabet, A the 1st, T the 20th and H the 8th. 13+1+20+8 = 42
[05:28:58] <SpiritSong> see...we had those in school. but they expected us to be able to figure it out without teaching us to actually do it
[05:29:14] <DawnBat> Why
[05:29:17] <SpiritSong> and tested our intelligence with it,,,something they didnt actually teach
[05:29:21] <SpiritSong> because they were nuns
[05:29:23] <SpiritSong> :P
[05:29:25] <DawnBat> Why do these weird thingshappens?
[05:29:44] <DawnBat> I don't think these seemingly random occurences are random
[05:29:51] <Hrafnbjorn> it is in part because of how mass fills space, DawnBat
[05:30:01] <DawnBat> Oh
[05:30:08] <DawnBat> So the cosmos is basically a giant prank?
[05:30:36] <Hrafnbjorn> a spiral, for example, has to follow what seems to be a formula in order to get larger (or smaller) as it get longer
[05:31:07] <DawnBat> ah
[05:32:10] <Hrafnbjorn> so, the math side is 1 part human made, 1 part nature made... the computations are all man made, but based off observations of nature and logic
[05:32:24] <DawnBat> intriguing
[05:32:37] <Hrafnbjorn> and thats about as much as I know about it, lol
[05:33:20] <SpiritSong> now i want to learn math
[05:33:26] <DawnBat> random totally off topic question.
[05:33:32] <DawnBat> What exactly is a Valkyrie
[05:33:34] <MissSugar> it also exists in the flower of life
[05:33:47] <SpiritSong> i hated it in high shcool because the teachers were rather abusive...
[05:34:00] <DawnBat> SpiritSong: You're not THAT old
[05:34:18] <SpiritSong> lmao how old did you think i was
[05:34:23] <DawnBat> 25
[05:34:24] <DawnBat> :P
[05:34:26] <SpiritSong> im 27
[05:34:28] <SpiritSong> :)
[05:34:49] <DawnBat> still too young for abusive teachers
[05:35:06] <SpiritSong> oh, nah , they were abusive with their words
[05:35:12] <Hrafnbjorn> sorry sepped away for a sec
[05:35:14] <DawnBat> Trueee
[05:35:21] <SpiritSong> but my infants teacher used to smack our hands with a rular
[05:35:36] <DawnBat> yikes
[05:35:53] <Hrafnbjorn> a valkyrjar are Odins fetch maidens... they fetch the souls of the battle slain.  In a few sagas it also implies it is part of a male warriors soul
[05:36:14] <Hrafnbjorn> literaly translates to "choosers of the slain"
[05:36:17] <DawnBat> So media usually gets them right?
[05:36:37] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Catholic school, SpiritSong??
[05:36:52] <SpiritSong> yeah archy
[05:36:53] <Hrafnbjorn> media kinda gets thm right, yeah
[05:36:58] <SpiritSong> whole way through
[05:37:18] <DawnBat> I just had a wonk thought.
[05:37:28] <SpiritSong> theyy arent like the movies...they're jjust normal high schools but you go to mass every now and then
[05:37:29] <DawnBat> I know almost nothing of ancient Egyptian creatures and sucg
[05:37:31] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Sorry you had to go through that, lass
[05:37:33] <Hrafnbjorn> one could theorize that male warriors become einherjar, female warriors become valkyrjar
[05:37:52] <SpiritSong> ah its grand, it didnt affect anything other than my liking of math
[05:38:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> ;)
[05:39:09] <DawnBat> Only creature I can think of is the Bennu bird, (basically a phoenix)
[05:39:17] <Hrafnbjorn> which may also explain what happens to Freyja's half of the battle slain... if she chooses the females.  Freyja is often calle Valadis (leader of the slain, or perhaps leader of the valkyrjar)

[05:47:53] <Hrafnbjorn> thanks
[05:48:10] * SpiritSong hugs DawnBat
[05:48:13] <SpiritSong> whats going on for you
[05:49:03] <DawnBat> other then the fact that the media is evil since it portrays everything as a happy go lucky world and in truth we live in an a cesspoolish existential void of anguish that is life.
[05:50:12] <Hrafnbjorn> what did I miss?
[05:50:23] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Life is as good or bad as you make it for yourself.
[05:51:28] <DawnBat> Hard to stay happy when the things that bring you down are all over
[05:52:33] <DawnBat> just getting tired of the charades of staying positive. Seems pointless what with everything going on these days.
[05:52:40] <SpiritSong> DawnBat the fakeness frustrates me too, i feel ya there, if they told us the truth it would at least be easier to process it and deal
[05:53:00] <SpiritSong> but i do agree, we sometimes have to focus on the positves to get by
[05:53:24] <Hrafnbjorn> what type of media are we speaking of?
[05:53:33] <DawnBat> visual
[05:53:55] <Hrafnbjorn> like movies?
[05:53:56] <DawnBat> I'm just hoping that these monthly injections that I'm gonna get will help my mood.
[05:54:09] <DawnBat> Anything really Hrafnbjorn, music videos. Movies and such
[05:54:53] <Hrafnbjorn> they dont all seem possitive to me... the positive ones are a bit absurd, I can agree with that though
[05:55:03] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> The so-called "news" is the worst
[05:55:14] <DawnBat> I try to be blissfully ignorant
[05:56:07] <DawnBat> you know what makes people happy?
[05:56:14] <DawnBat> RuPauls Drag Race! :P
[05:56:33] <Hrafnbjorn> not me
[05:56:40] <DawnBat> I'm teasing
[05:57:08] <Hrafnbjorn> doesnt make me unhappy either, of course
[05:57:43] <DawnBat> oh!
[05:57:46] <DawnBat> And being poor sucks too
[05:59:05] <DawnBat> like, why do the bourgeose still exist
[06:01:11] <Hrafnbjorn> do you mean bourgeois?
[06:01:14] <DawnBat> Yes
[06:01:24] <DawnBat> I do not know how to French
[06:01:30] <Hrafnbjorn> well, as long as there is wealth and poverty there will be a middle
[06:01:41] <Hrafnbjorn> bourgeois is that middle
[06:02:07] <DawnBat> Ag
[06:02:26] <Hrafnbjorn> it implies a sense of materialism though, which is the nature of humanity
[06:02:44] <DawnBat> that is true
[06:03:42] <Hrafnbjorn> before we were what we are there was the homo-habilis (handy human) and as a tool user it was materialistic, so it predates our homo form
[06:04:00] <DawnBat> true true
[06:04:23] <Hrafnbjorn> we tend to think about all that stuff more, hence the name homo-sapien (thinking human)
[06:04:57] <Hrafnbjorn> even other animals are materialistic... look at bower birds, or even dogs and cats

[07:03:42] <SpiritSong> not  me Hrafnbjorn...unless knot magick...anything like it in heathenism?
[07:03:43] <Pix> Is that who I think it is?!?
[07:03:56] <SpiritSong> depends on who you think it is
[07:04:01] <Hrafnbjorn> if you consider weaving knots
[07:04:04] <SpiritSong> but the typos likely gave me away
[07:04:47] <Pix> If you yell at me in all caps I'll know it's you dear;)
[07:04:52] <Hrafnbjorn> clans were judged according to their womens ability to weave, and there were feminine magics related to it
[07:05:10] <SpiritSong> haha you got me
[07:05:13] <SpiritSong> hi :P
[07:05:44] <Pix> Sweet song bird!!  How the heck are you?
[07:05:57] <Pix> It's been years!
[07:06:15] <SpiritSong> ahhh, thats interesting Hrafnbjorn, baskets and such? what were the magicks?
[07:06:42] <SpiritSong> i know right? ive been good, been knitting a lot. how are you doing??
[07:07:21] <Pix> Good,  I'm OK. Man it's already like a reunion
[07:07:35] <Hrafnbjorn> fabric... wool, flax, hemp all grew natural, plus by mid-viking period they also had cotton and silk.  Then of course there are the Norns, who are 3 giantess who weave the actions of men and gods into fate
[07:08:35] <Hrafnbjorn> the magics are trance based... during the act of weaving a woman would go into trance and sometimes prophesize, sometimes influence hamingja (luck) of others, etc....
[07:09:32] <SpiritSong> lmao i know right pix? 
[07:09:38] <SpiritSong> whats have you been doing

[08:10:20] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I had heard of it before.
[08:10:41] <raevynskyyemt> which book?
[08:10:56] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> There was a Country singer that did a song about it back in the early 70's.

[08:11:27] <raevynskyyemt> i read that book too
[08:11:37] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I love her stuff

[08:20:11] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> So, how did you like Fire Touched?
[08:20:31] <raevynskyyemt> i liked it

[08:21:30] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Of course, Mercy being Mercy, she got a bit miffed over it.
[08:21:31] <raevynskyyemt> no results in spotify. but some older songs are hard to find in digital
[08:22:11] <raevynskyyemt> i was surprised when bran cut them off
[08:22:20] <raevynskyyemt> didn't expect it
[08:22:39] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> There's one called "Able Bodied Man", and the melody is right, but the lyrics are not the ones I heard here. He may have re-written it for touring, and never re-recorded it.
[08:22:49] <raevynskyyemt> possibly
[08:23:01] <raevynskyyemt> but i have looked up songs from the 50s/60s/70s and they're nowhere
[08:23:04] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> He kind of had to, so there wouldn't be a war.
[08:23:12] <raevynskyyemt> the beatles just got on digital a few months ago
[08:23:26] <raevynskyyemt> i know he had to. i just wasn't expecting it
[08:23:35] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> I was never a big Beatles fan. I like some of there stuff.
[08:23:47] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> their
[08:23:52] <raevynskyyemt> therre are some songs i prefer the remake of, and some i prefer the original beatles version of
[08:23:58] <raevynskyyemt> i don't usually like covers
[08:24:32] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Well, some of theirs were covers of 50's tunes
[08:24:45] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Mr Postman, for example
[08:24:47] <raevynskyyemt> yeah. a lot of songs have been re recorded several times
[08:25:10] <raevynskyyemt> elvis didn't write any of his songs. they were all either covers, or written by someone else
[08:25:23] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> yup
[08:25:57] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Take a look at Dylan. There were several people who had bigger hits with his songs than he did
[08:26:35] <raevynskyyemt> i heard a version of "house of the rising sun" that i really liked recently
[08:26:39] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Sure, he had a few in the mid to late 70's, but his earlier stuff, others did better with
[08:28:57] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> House Of The Rising Sun? that one takes me back to High School, my Sophomore year
[08:30:07] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> Dang, that's a long time ago

[08:36:31] <raevynskyyemt> though five finger death punch also have a pretty good version
[08:36:41] <raevynskyyemt> i've heard that version, too. also a good one
[08:38:20] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> And the one by The Doors
[08:38:32] <raevynskyyemt> 'tis a popular song
[08:39:15] <ArchrWndrMcRbrt> yup

[18:38:52] <Hrafnbjorn> I havent worked on it since yesterday.  Only been up for about 3 hours today, and much of that was spend taking my dog for a hike looking for antler
[18:39:03] <Hrafnbjorn> *spent
[18:39:08] <North> any luck?
[18:39:18] <Hrafnbjorn> nope
[18:39:22] <North> ah well
[18:40:08] <Hrafnbjorn> oh, and participating in a debate over the historacity of the Vikings show, lol
[18:40:50] <Hrafnbjorn> a lot of folk are sure bent out of shape over it not being perfectly accurate, lol
[18:41:17] <North> shocking, a tv show not being entirely faithful to History   ;)
[18:41:46] <North> have you seen the 'Rome' series?
[18:42:57] <Hrafnbjorn> I only engaged in the part where folk were saying that cause the Saxons are essentialy southern Danes that ALL Scandinvaians would have known about the Brittish Isles, and they said they practiced the 'same' religion... they didnt practice the same religion, just related... and the Saxons were Anglo 400 years before viking period, so it could have been easily forgotten
[18:43:07] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah I saw Rome
[18:43:38] <North> not a bad show
[18:43:43] <North> first season, at least
[18:43:54] <Hrafnbjorn> I thought it was great, until I watched it on bluray where you could see the obvious 'fakeness' of the sets... but it was a great show still
[18:44:03] * North nods
[18:44:41] <North> in the show's defense, the writers learned that the show was being canceled midway through season 2, and had to cram
[18:45:08] <North> something like 5 seasons had been planned
[18:45:32] <Hrafnbjorn> it would be impossible to make an historicaly accurate show about early vikings...  Accuracy with Rome is easier, even though an earlier period, because of 2 reasons... they wrote stuff down, and they built with stone
[18:45:49] <Hrafnbjorn> wow, I didnt know they were gonna make 5 seasons...
[18:46:17] <North> somewhere around there, more or less
[18:47:44] <Hrafnbjorn> I think had they extended past the 3rd season it would have confused a lot of folk because shortly after where s3 ended the Roman empire split into 2, and folk always view the Western and Eastern empires as the same thing
[18:48:37] * North nods
[18:50:13] <North> was that Greek you were carving into that pot?
[18:50:34] <Hrafnbjorn> nope, was elder futhark runes
[18:50:40] <North> ah, k
[18:50:59] <North> <-- not particularly adept with languages
[18:51:36] <North> you translated the meaning yesterday, but I've forgotten
[18:52:15] <Hrafnbjorn> reads "Eira veita minn heilan" or "Eira help my healing"   Eira is one of Freyja's sisters, and a assistant to Frigga... she is called on for healing, so in a way you could say she is goddess of healing
[18:52:30] <North> interesting
[18:52:53] <North> we could all certainly use a little help with that
[18:53:01] <Hrafnbjorn> indeed
[18:55:57] <Hrafnbjorn> one could argue, though, that runes were heavily influenced by Greek writting
[18:56:14] <North> there seemed an aesthetic similarity
[18:57:31] <Hrafnbjorn> the folk that would eventualy establish the Germanic cultures certainly had a lot of Greek influence, ans they were Trojan Thracians, and Thracian culture was similar in many ways to their southern Greek neighbors
[18:58:49] <Hrafnbjorn> Thracians had their own religion, but civily, and academicaly they shared much with Greeks.  There is no record of a Thracian written language, and like the southern Celts, they probably used Greek to write
[18:58:53] * North nods over his lunch
[19:00:04] <North> quite the influential culture
[19:00:50] <Hrafnbjorn> other folk have connected runes to the Etruscan language, which evolved into Latin... and many of the characters do seem Etruscan, however by the time Etruscan was used the folk had already migrated to the Baltic... so either they had influence from proto-Etruscan (which is farther west than Thracian lands) or its coincidence
[19:02:23] <Hrafnbjorn> if we knew how much interaction there was between the southern Germanics and the Nordic Germanics, it might be easier to discern the Romantic connection, because there was a lot of interaction with the southern Germanics and Rome, but no interaction between Nordics and Rome until well after runes were developed
[19:03:34] <North> so relatively little to be glimpsed when peering back through the mists of time
[19:03:43] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[19:04:22] <North> are you fairly fluent with those runes?
[19:04:29] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah
[19:04:32] <North> cool
[19:04:52] <North> in speech, as well?
[19:05:27] <Hrafnbjorn> its hard to 'read' what is left for us on the rune-stones cause it was not a formalized written language, so no grammar at all, spelling was subjective, plus they were often written as codes
[19:05:43] <North> ah, k
[19:05:48] <Hrafnbjorn> I have studied the Scandinavian languages up to 13th century, yeah
[19:06:38] * North imagines eavesdropppers being thorougly bamboozled
[19:07:11] <Hrafnbjorn> so, Old Norse, Old Svearish (northern Swede) Old Guntish (southern Swede), Old Danish, Old English, and Frankish, and Frisian 
[19:07:48] <North> quite a language continuum
[19:08:14] <Hrafnbjorn> they are all closely connected, so its like the difference between American, and Brittish English
[19:08:22] <North> oh, hmm
[19:09:11] <North> your background is Scandinavian, I take it
[19:09:41] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah, Swedish and Danish
[19:09:46] * North nods
[19:10:05] <North> nick was a bit of a clue   ;)
[19:10:52] <Hrafnbjorn> Can trace family line farther in Sweden than Denmark though... on dads side, the Swede, I can trace back to 900's... on moms side, the Dane, I can only trace back a few centuries
[19:12:07] <Hrafnbjorn> my dads side is an important family line in sweden, and France (even though I dont have any French heritage)
[19:12:11] <North> not bad at all, considering that most people are usually only aware of the last 3 generations, if that
[19:12:41] <Hrafnbjorn> its easier to trace Scandinavian lineage than most places cause they kept very good records
[19:13:45] <Hrafnbjorn> there is a saga called Heimskringla which is a geneological record going back to mythic times, so it helps a lot if your family line is one of the ons in the saga
[19:14:03] <North> I would imagine so
[19:14:44] <North> like strapping rocket boosters onto your search
[19:14:56] <Hrafnbjorn> lol, yaeh

[19:16:59] <Hrafnbjorn> runes can be an exciting study though, cause we are still finding new runestones, and there are still a whole lot that have not been translated yet... mostly cause of how vague and ineffective they are for writing
[19:17:31] <Hrafnbjorn> plus there are some highly debated areas, such as runestones found in N America
[19:18:11] * North imagines a Nag Hammadi-level find of runestones
[19:18:57] <North> difficult to verify authenticity, I'd imagine
[19:19:18] <Hrafnbjorn> there is even runes carved into the Hagia Sofia mosque... they read "Halfdan was here" lol
[19:19:33] <North> haha
[19:20:41] <Hrafnbjorn> yeah the n american runestones are very hard to prove any authenticity... the script is historic, but there is too much grammar, and more modern use of words.  To me the Kensington Rune Stone, found in Minnesota, seems to be from the 1700's
[19:22:00] <Hrafnbjorn> runes actualy got more popular during the Christian period, so who knows how much the early Scandinavian immigrants to N America brought with them
[19:22:26] <North> certainly a possibility
[19:23:28] <Hrafnbjorn> We can prove that Norse vikings came to N America, as we have found 2 settlments in Newfoundland so far, plus a few viking coins, and a viking anchor found off Florida
[19:24:21] <Hrafnbjorn> but, there is no real evidence they made it inland to Minnesota
[19:25:24] <North> fraud knows no boundaries, seemingly
[19:25:39] <Hrafnbjorn> since the only cultures that had any real success fighting the vikings off were the Irish, and the Native Americans, I find it a bit unlikely that they continued to look for places to settle in N America after they were run out of Vinland

[19:26:04] <North> indeed
[19:26:19] <Hrafnbjorn> the Franks and Byzantines didnt have any luck fighting them, so they bought them, lol
[19:26:24] <Hrafnbjorn> Heilsa tremens!
[19:26:45] <tremens> hi
[19:26:59] <North> not the worst of all possible strategies
[19:28:24] <Hrafnbjorn> nope, in both cases, them buying them had a huge impact on world history... the Franks bought them off, which created the Normans, which created the Brittish Empire... the Byzantines bought them, which created the Varangian Rus, which created Russia (albeit in Ukraine)
[19:29:27] <North> incalculable, the ripple effect
[19:29:42] * Hrafnbjorn nods
[19:30:43] * North stares at his empty pizza plate, scarcely able to credit his senses
[19:30:50] <North> so sad when the pizza's all gone
[19:31:18] <Hrafnbjorn> of course those (Norman and Rus) were not from same regions... Rus were Swedes and Geats, Normans were Dane and Norse
[19:34:48] <North> well, sir, I do believe it's time for a nap
[19:35:10] <Hrafnbjorn> pizza=naptime, lol... ok nap well!
