[20:37:29] <StarThorn> Holy crap.
[20:37:34] <StarThorn> http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/be-very-afraid-hell-has-frozen-over-bash-is-coming-to-windows-10/
[20:37:50] <StarThorn> http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2016/03/ubuntu-on-windows.html
[20:38:25] <StarThorn> Microsoft is working with Ubuntu to build an ELF/syslcall emulation layer into Windows, and will support being able to run an Ubuntu-based Linux CLI environment on Windows.
[20:38:46] <StarThorn> It's already functional and will be out for limited testing soon, and is expected to ship with a Windows 10 update this summer.
[20:42:41] <Ikarus> wait, WHAT
[20:42:57] <Ikarus> Microsoft has gone slightly mad it seems
[20:43:55] <Ikarus> ofcourse, the Windows GUI experience is terrible, but it's interestign otherwise
[20:44:43] <StarThorn> Yeah, it's one of those, "Holy crap, hell is freezing over." things.
[20:45:12] <StarThorn> But, it also makes a lot of sense.  This makes the OS a lot more developer friendly, especially for people using Perl/Python/Ruby/etc.
[20:45:24] <StarThorn> And, it helps them support cloud deployments better.
[20:45:30] <StarThorn> Like it or not, Linux is eating their lunch on the "cloud" deployment front.
[20:45:37] <StarThorn> If they want to be competitive there, they need to ramp up the remote access, management, and automation support, and slim down the builds.
[20:45:41] <Ikarus> Well, it is still pointless as the enviroment won't perfectly mirror 
[20:45:43] <StarThorn> So, it makes sense that they're pushing Windows Server Core, and ssh, Linux utilities, etc.  Things that make supporting hundreds or thousands of cloud machines much, much easier.
[20:46:08] <StarThorn> I don't mean developing for Linux, I mean people who are doing Windows development but want to use those tools to help them.
[20:46:25] <Ikarus> My worry, in companies that aren't primary IT shops, but have both developers/admins for servers and desktops, as two seperate teams
[20:46:35] <StarThorn> Hell, I've got Strawberry Perl installed on my box because it's useful for a lot of things.  I've had cygwin installed for the same reason.
[20:46:39] <Ikarus> the desktop team forcing Windows on the dev/admin team that primarily works on servers
[20:46:48] <Ikarus> which is going to be adorably broken
[20:47:09] <Ikarus> but this is just my experience with companies who even try "Windows desktops and Cygwin" and such
[20:47:39] <StarThorn> Well, apparently support for this will be rolling out this summer in the next Windows 10 update.
[20:53:37] <Quickshot> Guess we'll see how it works out in the coming years
[20:54:58] <StarThorn> From the second article (posted by an Ubuntu developer on the project), it apparently works pretty well already.
[20:55:28] <StarThorn> In a lot of ways, it's not too far off from the old POSIX Subsystem for NT and Unix Services for Windows that they used to offer.

[21:34:08] <Ikarus> StarThorn: well, it's syscall compatible
[21:37:53] <ankh> the trouble with the posix system was that a process could use *either* Windows or Posix API but not both
[21:39:56] *** Quits: ankh (liam@sorcery-2nv.931.98.75.IP) (Quit: train arrives)
[21:41:17] * StarThorn nods.
[21:41:41] <StarThorn> It'll be interesting to see how well it works and how complete it is when it's released.
[21:41:56] <StarThorn> I'm excited, though.  I'd love to have a solid *nix environment easily available in Windows.
[23:30:07] <Thunderguy> And hopefully soon, Windows will start developing an environment for Linux ( such as an officially supported WINE ), but that's wishful thinking
[23:45:19] <Sein> I would not trust mircosoft with my linux machine
