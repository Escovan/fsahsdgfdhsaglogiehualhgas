[16:40:36] <timm> Hello
[16:45:25] <Quickshot> Hi
[16:45:49] <timm> Hello Quickshot
[16:51:59] <StarThorn> Cool, successfully registered ~60 or so RHEL systems with RH Network classic using the Ansible module.
[16:53:24] <Quickshot> Congrats
[16:53:44] <StarThorn> Thanks.  Much better than doing them by hand. ;-)

[19:34:53] <ankh> ansible is the new puppet?
[19:45:14] <Ikarus> slightly surprised that memcached is still pretty much first choice for just ephemeral data caching for web stuff
[19:49:28] <ankh> why surprised?
[19:49:41] <ankh> oh, because it hasn't been forked and died you mean? :)
[20:09:45] <StarThorn> ankh: In some ways, yeah.  Similar functionality, but with some advantages, IMO, and better suited to system administrators vs. programmers.
[20:14:02] <Ikarus> ankh: well, I would have expected something to have beaten it with like a few basic new features (clustering and namespacing being the big ones)
[20:17:58] * ankh nods
[20:23:55] <Ikarus> but nope, Redis is an alternative, but it basically brings along the kitchen sink
[20:27:10] <Ikarus> (Redis still has no namespaces or config file oriented time out expiration policies
[20:28:23] <ankh> i see
[20:53:05] <Ccomp5950> I cringe everytime I get a ticket asking to open up the firewall so everyone can see the redis port.
[20:53:09] <Ccomp5950> "You are doing it wrong."
[20:54:35] <ankh> er yeah
[22:11:01] <StarThorn> Ikarus: First, simple, and "good enough" won the day, it seem.
[22:11:28] <StarThorn> That, and flexibility.  memcached has ended up in a ton of places that I would have have thought to use it, as compared to it's original purpose.
