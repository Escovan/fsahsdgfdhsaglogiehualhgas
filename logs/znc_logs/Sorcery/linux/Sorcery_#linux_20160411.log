[19:13:08] <Karolis2011> How is your Linux installs are doing?
[19:13:23] <Karolis2011> What is your opinion on bash on Windows?

[20:42:30] <ankh> 15 years ago Microsoft could have demolished the credibility of Linux in the corporate and server world really easily; now it's too late and they have to work with it
[22:30:08] *** Lapthysius is now known as Aethysius
[22:37:01] <Aethysius> It's going to be the year of Linux on the desktop soon! :P
[22:39:24] <ankh> maybe
[22:39:46] <ankh> but Microsoft's stated reason for implementing a Linux ABI is for server usage
[22:40:09] <StarThorn> The reason I saw was for developer use.
[22:40:13] <Aethysius> Oh.
[22:40:27] * Aethysius was out of that loop
[22:40:36] <ankh> yes
[22:40:41] <StarThorn> The article I saw (from a Microsoft person) said that it was CLI only, no GUI support, intended for developers to be able to utilize Linux Development tools on Windows.
[22:40:47] <ankh> (these two things are not inconsistent of course)
[22:40:52] * StarThorn nods.
[22:40:53] <StarThorn> Agreed.
[22:40:53] <ankh> yes, CLI
[22:41:11] <StarThorn> So, don't expect X Windows on Windows anytime soon (at least, not supported by Microsoft).
[22:41:14] <ankh> in particular you get bash, not e.g. a  Unity or GNOME desktop
[22:41:45] <StarThorn> Although, it wouldn't surprise me to see community supported Unity/Gnome/etc. show up eventually.
[22:43:04] <ankh> i don't know, that might depend on whether device access to video drivers is exposed appropriately
[22:43:09] <ankh> but it wouldn't amaze me either
[22:43:15] <ankh> or wayland :)
[22:43:34] * StarThorn nods.
[22:44:29] <StarThorn> Until it's released and I have a chance to dig in and play with it, I dunno what it'll end up looking like.
[22:45:00] <StarThorn> But, then again, just being able to access bash, common command line tools, perl, etc., will make me really happy.
