[16:37:48] <StarThorn> I think today is a Soundgarden Temple of the Dog + Audioslave sorta day.
[16:38:48] <Quickshot> Really?
[16:41:19] <StarThorn> Yep.
[16:41:41] <StarThorn> Hard to go wrong with that set, really.
[16:42:31] <Quickshot> I see.
[16:54:29] <Ccomp5950> I prefer Theory of a Nickle Creed, myself
[17:15:16] <StarThorn> That's not bad, although I prefer Alter Bridge to Creed these days.
[17:33:36] <StarThorn> Ooh, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is officially out.
[17:38:23] <Quickshot> Guess people can stick with that one for awhile then?
[17:39:27] <StarThorn> Yep.  Supported for 5 years on all variants.
[17:39:40] <StarThorn> Here's some bits on nea features and such: https://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/04/20/canonical-unveils-6th-lts-release-of-ubuntu-with-16-04/
[17:40:38] <StarThorn> The "Snaps" new package thing is interesting.  Sounds like it's a .deb compatibile package format that works as kind of an in-between for packages that you want to manage with standard-ish tools, but want kept separate from the base system.
