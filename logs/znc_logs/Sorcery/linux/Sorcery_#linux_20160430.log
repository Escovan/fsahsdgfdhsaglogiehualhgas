[11:06:03] <Thunderguy> thats strange, what was my quit message?
[11:09:06] <Thunderguy> irssi crashed... actually crashed for no apparrant reason
[11:09:25] <Thunderguy> it has never done that in my life
[12:14:24] <Quickshot> Hmmm
[12:14:35] <Quickshot> Well, there's always a small chance for something strange happening
[12:14:53] <Quickshot> Heck, there's even a small chance a bit error was caused by cosmic radiation, causing irssi to crash
