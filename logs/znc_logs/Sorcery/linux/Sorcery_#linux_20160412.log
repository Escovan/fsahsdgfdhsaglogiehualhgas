[00:10:50] * Fragosaurus shakes his head
[00:11:20] <Fragosaurus> I use linux because its the only operating system that is dinosaur-friendly.
[00:19:03] <Quickshot> Dinosaur support even?
[00:35:12] * Fragosaurus shrugs
[00:35:20] <Fragosaurus> all I know is its hard to type with stubby arms
[00:36:19] <Quickshot> That sounds like it would be the case, yeah
[00:42:26] <Sein> They will have to invent the linux version of the office paperclip.
[00:49:35] <ankh> it already exists, Sein
[00:49:49] <ankh> it's called vigor (or vigour maybe)
[00:50:05] <ankh> and it... er... advises you on using vim
[01:41:31] <Fragosaurus> oooh... how did I miss this image? https://stallman.org/photos/rms-working/mid/mid_img_4188.jpg
[01:43:38] <Quickshot> Well, that is something else
