[04:54:08] <Fragmint> that is all

[16:21:19] <Quickshot> Guess some one wasn't happy with systemd a bit back there. ^^;
[16:25:56] <StarThorn> I like some aspects of it, and very much dislike a number of others.
[16:26:22] <StarThorn> I consider it 3 steps forward, and 2 steps back, with a couple of spins in there.
[16:26:41] <StarThorn> We are left one step ahead of where we were, but we're also dizzy, confused, and at greater risk of falling over.
[16:26:47] <Quickshot> ^^;
[16:26:53] <Quickshot> Sounds about right
[16:27:19] <Quickshot> The two steps back probably being putting everything under the sun in to a single monolithic init package
[16:29:16] <StarThorn> That's part of it.  I'm also not a fan of how they handled journald, and how systemd in general feels more opaque and harder to troubleshoot (with poorer documentation).
[16:29:56] <Quickshot> Ah right right
[16:30:15] <Quickshot> No idea why they thought a database for logging was a good idea
[16:46:21] * StarThorn smirks.
[16:46:29] <StarThorn> It amuses me that the following are legitimate command options:
[16:46:32] <StarThorn> netstat -peanut
[16:46:34] <StarThorn> netstat -polenta
[16:54:34] <Quickshot> Heh
[17:41:38] *** Karolis is now known as Kar
[19:24:41] <ankh> in theory a db for logging could mean more powerful querying
[19:25:49] <ankh> strictly speaking systemd is not a monolithic replacement for init - the individual init scripts convert to systemd files and still run as separate tasks
[20:34:12] <StarThorn> ankh: I've mostly seen the monolithic argument leveled against it from a creeping featurism standpoint.
[20:34:39] <StarThorn> First it was an init replacement.  Then it was also a syslog replacement.  And a login replacement.  And a cron replacement.
[20:35:34] <StarThorn> It's continually growing and adding new things that have established modular/separate components, and doing so in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to use some of those components.
[20:35:42] <StarThorn> (The traditional ones.)
[21:07:10] <ankh> StarThorn, yes, i agree there isn't agreement about its scope
