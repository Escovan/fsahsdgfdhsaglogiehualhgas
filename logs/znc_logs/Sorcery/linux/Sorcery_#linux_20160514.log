[15:11:43] * Thunderguy creates an economy based on linux: tuxonomics
[15:11:59] * Thunderguy submits it to congress
[15:12:11] <Thunderguy> kidding.... good idea tho right?
[15:16:10] <Thunderguy> It has a top command to determine live how every sector is doing, and multiple economic runlevels for wartime and peacetime (1) (2) etc... a shutdown command ( not intended for use ) and recovery tools
[15:16:27] <Quickshot> Tuxonomics, with more Tux, I see
[15:16:45] <Thunderguy> heh
[15:16:49] <Quickshot> The runlevels seems convenient as well
[15:18:35] <Thunderguy> mmhmm runlevel 1 is for command economies, 2 is for market, and 0 for complete capitalism, but you can use the nice command for socialism
[15:20:04] <Thunderguy> unfortently coming put of 0( complete capitalism) could require the recovery mode
[15:21:18] <Quickshot> Hmm
[15:21:30] <Quickshot> Well atleast the commands are all ready with this model
[15:21:52] <Thunderguy> the good thing about tuxonomics is that anyone who has experience with Linux can run a state economy
[15:22:32] <Quickshot> That sounds fantastic. :)
[15:22:50] <Thunderguy> :) I shall work on it...
[15:23:32] * Thunderguy takes out the debian manual and an economic book to create the tuxonomics psuedo manual

[20:00:18] <ankh> Thunderguy, buthow does it work to help keep people in power, preserve status quo, and suppress the poor? :)
