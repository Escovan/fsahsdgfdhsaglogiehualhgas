[02:19:02] <ankh> Thunderguy, yeah, dual boot systems are more common these days :)
[02:19:33] <ankh> the DEC Ultrix system our customer was using wouldn't have been happy trying to run wine :)
[02:22:11] <Quickshot> I guess it would have cost more time then it was worth.
[02:48:57] <ankh> since wine wasnt then invented I think, yes :)
[02:49:22] <ankh> and Windows hadn't been ported to the CPU in question either, nor to that architecture
[02:50:19] <Quickshot> That does sound like it would have taken a lot of time then, yes
[02:50:34] <ankh> (1993 i think, or 1994)
[02:51:22] <ankh> when we walked into the room with the computer I remember saying, it doesn't have enough memory, and the guy in charge of systems there looked at me and said how do you know? and I said by the sound it's making
[02:51:34] <ankh> I could hear the disk clicking constantly)a(
[02:51:36] <ankh> er
[03:02:17] <Quickshot> Ahhh
[03:02:24] <Quickshot> Constant swapping
[03:05:23] <ankh> yeah
[03:05:43] <ankh> they sold the machines without enough memory - all of the Unix vendors did, to lower the price
[03:10:14] <Quickshot> Ahh and then they'd later need the memory anyway
[03:10:20] <Quickshot> Thus boosting income
[03:10:31] <ankh> right
[03:10:35] <ankh> same with hard drives
