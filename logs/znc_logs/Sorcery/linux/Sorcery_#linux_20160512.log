[18:32:51] <Kar> Hmm
[18:32:55] <Kar> I got question
[18:33:03] <Kar> Or few
[18:33:31] <ankh> hi Kar
[18:33:36] <Kar> Hello
[18:34:29] <Kar> I shortened my name because gaia server owner liked it without numbers
[18:34:50] <Kar> and the simple Karolis was too plain
[18:35:29] <Kar> So, yeah, I wanted to ask about disk perfomance isuess on Linux in the long run
[18:35:44] <Kar> Windows has them, but has tool to fix them
[18:36:56] <ankh> as in e.g. fragmentation?
[18:37:19] <Kar> Yes
[18:37:41] <ankh> if your disk is under 80% full, you won't need it with most Linux file systems
[18:38:02] <ankh> if your disk gets over 80% full, there are tools such as e4defrag
[18:38:11] <ankh> but wait e.g. a year or so before using them
[18:38:33] <Kar> why?
[18:38:48] <ankh> Linux systems build on a heritage of multi-user systems from Unix, and are designed to allocate disk space in a way that doesn't need defragmenting normally
[18:39:26] <Kar> So most of the time it will be fast?
[18:39:28] <ankh> (this came into Unix in 1982 or so with the BSD filesystem in 4.2 BSD)
[18:39:29] <ankh> yes
[18:39:58] <Kar> Also, is there tools to defrag other partitions?
[18:40:17] <ankh> for defragmenting a Windows disk, use Windows
[18:40:26] <Kar> like to defrag Windows NTFS from Linux
[18:40:34] <ankh> yeah, that's not a good idea it turns out
[18:40:47] <Kar> Why?
[18:40:53] <Kar> It is ideal idea
[18:40:55] <ankh> but again, you're less likely to need it even if you write to an NTFS disk from Linux
[18:41:01] <Kar> You can defrag everything
[18:41:09] <ankh> you can possibly run the Windows tool under wine, I dont' know
[18:41:27] <ankh> NTFS support has been improving in Linux
[18:41:48] <Kar> Well, like my currently using brothers laptop is running Windows 10
[18:41:57] <Kar> and it allways slowsdown
[18:42:18] <Kar> also at work almost all systems get slow because of frgments
[18:43:49] <ankh> in Linux, a block, a piece of a new file, doesn't get written immediately to disk, so that when a growing file is written it's usually in large efficient chunks; if small chunks are needed there's only ever at most one at the very end of the file, which is rewritten in a large chunk if the file grows
[18:44:13] <ankh> so Linux (and Unix) systems don't slow down over time that way for that reason
[18:45:09] <ankh> note, this is for a hard drive, not an ssd; don't defrag a Linux ssd at all, ever
[18:45:28] <ankh> it won't speed it up, and rewriting files reduces its life
[18:47:12] <Kar> Yeah, Perfom Defraggler don't allow to defrag SSDs
[18:47:28] <Kar> Only "Optimize"
[18:47:45] <Kar> and I have no idea what it does.
[18:49:43] <ankh> nor I

[22:17:35] * Quickshot sneaks in
[22:27:33] <StarThorn> Ah, ha!
[22:27:40] * StarThorn points at Quickshot.
[22:29:16] * Quickshot blinks
[22:29:21] <Quickshot> Uhmm... I was here all the time?
[22:29:39] <StarThorn> Oh, right.  In that case, nevermind.  Carry on.
[22:29:56] <Quickshot> Ahh, didn't think you'd buy that.
[22:29:59] * StarThorn whistles and pretends nothing happened.
[22:30:00] <Quickshot> But thanks. ^^
