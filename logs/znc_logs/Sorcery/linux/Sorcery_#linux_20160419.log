[13:01:42] <Aethysius> Damn, I had forgotten about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqZplJQU3Ak
[13:03:28] <Quickshot> Ahhh
[13:03:34] <Quickshot> That has been awhile ago now
[13:03:47] <Aethysius> ikr
[13:35:00] <Escovan> wtf is wrong with VirtualMin? Arrogant user in another chan told me it was bad ... Well for now, itÂ´s better than writing my own scripts to manage virtual hosts.
[14:50:00] <GreekFrag> theres no linux related news. =*(
[14:50:46] <Aethysius> Sure there is. This is the year of the Linux desktop!
[14:52:11] <GreekFrag> noone owns a desktop anymore, its a hollow victory!
[14:53:05] <Quickshot> Except for all the desktops still out there I guess
[14:53:14] <Quickshot> And I think laptops are kind of counted in the same category?
[14:53:43] <Quickshot> All the other market segments have already had the year of linux already anyway
[14:53:48] <Quickshot> Well except maybe real time stuff
[14:54:25] * Aethysius much prefers desktops and laptops to tablets.
[14:54:55] <Quickshot> The year of linux gaming was last year I guess
[14:56:10] <Aethysius> More and more games are being released for Linux, yes. However, there are still quite a few that aren't on Linux, and I've found that games, well the ones I play, tend to run better on Windows. :/
[15:06:07] <Quickshot> That's possible, yup
[15:06:16] <Quickshot> Wouldn't be surprising if that still gets more attention for now
[15:06:31] <Aethysius> That's the only reason why I use Windows.
[15:06:36] <Quickshot> But if there's ever a year of the Linux desktop, that could all turn around. ^_-
[15:06:46] <Aethysius> heh

[18:46:28] <Thunderguy> I own a desktop... running Linux
[18:46:59] <Thunderguy> The only time I ever touch a windows PC is when someone asks me to look at their virus
[18:50:16] <[R]> I think that's the story for many of us here
[18:53:31] <Quickshot> Probably, yeah

[19:07:30] <Thunderguy> Escovan: In a virtual machine I hope :P
[19:15:30] <Escovan> No, I actually Insider-Test new builds of Windows
[19:16:35] <Escovan> Did you know the latest build of Windows 10 actually has BASH?
[19:47:25] <Quickshot> From Ubuntu, right?
[19:56:06] <[R]> What patches does Ubuntu do for bash?
[19:56:59] <Quickshot> All the patches? ^_-
