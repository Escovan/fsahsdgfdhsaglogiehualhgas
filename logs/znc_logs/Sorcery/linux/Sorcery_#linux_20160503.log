[15:17:23] <StarThorn> Hrm.  We haven't seen Thunderguy since he talked about converting an Ubuntu system to a Debian system.  I wonder if he tried it, and it went bad, and now he can't get it working again?
[15:19:29] <StarThorn> Hrm.  Anyone know of any tools that can take an XML document and expand out the elements to spit out a CSV?
[16:59:03] <ankh> it depends on the XML
[16:59:21] <ankh> (that's like asking if there are tools that take a program written in ASCII text and convert them to compiled binary :-) )
[16:59:54] <ankh> but XQuery and XSLT are usually good ways to do the conversion
[17:01:49] <Quickshot> StarThorn, Something to ask him if he shows up again?

[17:23:27] <StarThorn> ankh: Yeah, I was hoping someone might know of a tool that would just expand out all elements and dump it as CSV, without me having to write any code for it. ;-)
[17:23:40] <StarThorn> Hrm.  This is interesting: https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-expands-red-hat-developer-program-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux-developer-subscription
[17:25:08] <ankh> StarThorn, that might exist if your XML is flat and does not contain mixed content
[17:31:23] <StarThorn> ankh: Which (at first glance) looks to be the case.  I'm at the point where I'll probably just throw together a script to try to process it, though.  I think I can do that faster than find something else.
[17:32:32] <ankh> it'll likely be a really simple XSLT transform
[17:33:13] <ankh> if you're using xsltproc, use string replacement - replace() from exslt - to do escaping probably.
[17:39:51] * StarThorn nods.
[17:40:28] <StarThorn> Good call.  XSLT is probably the best way to approach this.  I was originally just going to try to read it into memory and then iterate through it via a Perl script.
[17:40:35] * StarThorn will take a shot with xsltproc.
[17:42:18] <ankh> if you get stuck i'll gladly help
[17:50:38] <StarThorn> Cool, thanks. ;-)
