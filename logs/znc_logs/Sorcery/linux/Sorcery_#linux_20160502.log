[22:05:19] <StarThorn> Sort of.
[22:05:23] <StarThorn> D'oh.  Missed him.
[22:05:44] <StarThorn> You can convert between Debian and Ubuntu, but you will typically end up with some broken stuff.
[22:07:19] <Quickshot> Which you'd preferably know a bit about the systems so you can fix it?
[22:09:32] <StarThorn> Hopefully.  Sometimes there are low-level incompatibilities that can be tricky, however.
[22:09:51] <StarThorn> For example, if you have packages that depend on Ubuntu-specific packages, which don't exist in Debian.  And vice-versa.
[22:10:36] <StarThorn> Also, they're going to be based off of different release points, so unless you're planning on going to Debian Testing/Sid, you're going to probably have issues.
[22:11:21] <StarThorn> As a general rule, I'd pretty strongly recommend against trying to do an in-place conversion between the two.  You're better off standing up a new box/instance with the target OS, dumping you installed package list from the current box, installing them on the new one, then copying configs over.
[22:11:37] <StarThorn> It's relatively painless, usually, and will result in a much more stable and reliable system.

[22:57:01] <ankh> i'd agree with that approach too - you don't know what patches Ubuntu had made (and there's usually lots)
[22:59:06] * StarThorn nods.
[22:59:29] <StarThorn> Also, Ubuntu has moved to systemd as the default init, and Debian isn't quite as far along in their transition.
[23:01:09] <Quickshot> Sure, fair enough
