[15:52:34] <StarThorn> Ooops.  Missed Cammy.
[15:52:45] * StarThorn has actually been having pretty good luck with Ubuntu 16.04.
[15:53:28] <Karolis> :o
[15:53:44] <Karolis> Once again?
[15:54:13] <Karolis> My Ubuntu 15.04 reports error every boot
[15:59:20] <StarThorn> What error?
[15:59:47] <StarThorn> I updated a 15.10 laptop to 16.04, and a server that was a release or two behind.  Both over the weekend.
[16:00:47] <StarThorn> The server had a few quirks, not all packages got upgraded under do-release-upgrade.  A follow-up aptitude full-upgrade finished it out fine, though.
[16:39:29] <Karolis> Well, I will tell you when I am home

[23:13:38] <StarThorn> I think I'm going to have to write a Big Brother extension module.  Ugh.
