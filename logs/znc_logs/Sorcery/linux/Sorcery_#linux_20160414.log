[13:05:05] <Escovan> What´s a ~/public_html/.well-known directory doing on my box? (CentOS 6.7/Virtualmin)
[13:06:25] <Quickshot> I can't think of a reason right away...  my 'Gentoo' system doesn't have it
[13:06:36] <Quickshot> Maybe its some particular program you're using?
[13:06:50] <Quickshot> Anything recognizable about the content?
[13:07:07] <Escovan> It might be the VirtualMin ... There´s nothing in it - appearantly. 
[13:07:16] <Quickshot> And if one is willing to experiment a bit, what happens if you rename it?
[13:08:00] <Escovan> there are also .virtualmin-src files in the parent directories ... Don´t want to mess up virtualmin
[13:09:23] <Quickshot> Ok
[13:10:47] <Escovan> Nothing happens to the site it belongs to when I rename it.
[13:11:47] <Escovan> Nothing wrong in Virtualmin either.
[13:12:41] <Escovan> hmmm
[13:12:43] <Quickshot> Well it's probably cached though, you'd have to restart the thing to know for sure
[13:15:43] <Escovan> Mweh, 2 days ago I made a full backup. If somethings gets fubar I can restore it.
[13:16:18] <Escovan> http://fortune.prutsplek.nl/ <--- Fortune cookies :P A webpage made in BASH :P
[15:30:45] <StarThorn> There used to be lots of web pages in bash.  Shell scripting was very common for CGI scripts.
[15:54:04] * StarThorn remembers rewriting some bash cgi scripts into Perl and Java back in 2001 for a job.
[15:55:00] <GreekFrag> oooh, cookies!
[15:55:28] <Ikarus> StarThorn: I've written CGI C code....
[15:56:00] <Ikarus> but that was for very long poll CGI stuff (before we had websocks, etc) that needed to minimize memory footprint
[15:56:25] * StarThorn nods.
[15:57:14] <StarThorn> CGI's in C were not uncommon in early days, too.  In fact, shell and C were among the most common options for a while, until the P languages came along (Perl, PHP, Python, Puby, and Pickle).
[15:57:30] <Ikarus> StarThorn: well, I couldn't find a good CGI parameter parsing lib in C
[15:57:36] <Ikarus> I ended up writing my own teensie tiny one
[15:57:49] <Ikarus> that I've reused in a bunch of other projects (for various uses)
[15:58:46] <StarThorn> Yeah, that happened a lot, too.  Things tended to be very manual back then, with a lot of reinventing the wheel for CGI related stuff.
[15:59:04] <Ikarus> leading to "fun bugs"
[15:59:08] <StarThorn> That, or lots of copy/paste from poorly written script archives, where most of the scripts were rife with security issues.
[15:59:30] <Ikarus> StarThorn: well, running env in a CGI script leaves you open to exploits :)
[15:59:33] <Ikarus> so eeeh
[16:02:45] * StarThorn nods.
[16:03:06] <Ikarus> been having some fun times recently
[16:03:17] <Ikarus> writing a thttpd replacement in Haskell, although I might redo it in Erlang
[16:03:21] <StarThorn> I have to admit, modern web frameworks make things so slick and easy these days, it's easy to forget how challenging it used to be to do simple CGI stuff sometimes.
[16:03:31] <Ikarus> basic idea is to get something as light, but in a really robust, well structured language 
[16:03:33] <StarThorn> Nice.  Erlang is a fun one to play with.
[16:03:39] <Ikarus> Go/Rust need not apply
[16:03:52] <StarThorn> Talk about a langauge that forces you to rethink your basic programming paradigms and assumptions.
[16:03:56] <Ikarus> (the way HTTP requests work make functional programming almost an automatic choice)
[16:08:32] <StarThorn> Yeah, REST and Functional are a good match.
[16:09:05] <StarThorn> I played around with Erlang back like 6-7 years ago.  I've always wanted to play with it again.
[16:37:36] * Escovan is an IT guy with an information processing disorder - His wife a chef with food allergies ... ironic :P
