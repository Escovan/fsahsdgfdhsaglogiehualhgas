[00:56:28] <EronGari> so how's pommy been?
[00:56:57] <EronGari> been a long time but like to check in on youze
[00:57:13] <VerifiedShitlady> I thought you were dead
[00:57:15] <EronGari> now and then
[00:57:18] <EronGari> almost
[00:57:25] <EronGari> in the process of it
[00:57:31] <EronGari> may take awhile though
[00:57:39] <VerifiedShitlady> What
[00:57:42] <EronGari> rather just get it over with
[00:58:20] <EronGari> no, I got sick around my birthday this year, a couple days in the hospital, and still trying to get back to where I was
[00:58:54] <EronGari> made a trip tp visit mom - spent a week in California - first time in 9 years
[00:59:14] <EronGari> but back home in Morelia again nopw
[01:01:12] <EronGari> recommended, especially for international flights - use the wheel chair service, and tip them well - a breeze through customs and immigrations, othewise a lot of hassle - mucho pinchy pedo
[01:02:00] <EronGari> I can walk but I didn't have the stamina to do the big airport thing with all my bags
[01:02:20] * VerifiedShitlady hugs EronGari 
[01:02:31] <EronGari> hugses
[01:02:51] <VerifiedShitlady> :D
[01:02:58] <VerifiedShitlady> EronGari: I'm homeless
[01:03:18] <EronGari> I am doing better though  -  yeah, I knew that happened and thought you might still be
[01:03:49] <EronGari> was wondering about it - no home yet, but all is ok?
[01:04:06] <VerifiedShitlady> Yes I'm going to get my own place next week
[01:04:14] <EronGari> oh, coolness
[01:04:46] <EronGari> I got back in time that we had to move, so I am camping at my casita until the new place is ready
[01:05:51] <EronGari> the movers took the furniture to the new place today but Tere still has to go and get things in order
[01:06:57] <EronGari> and I think she wants to have the builders put up a 3rd ba√±o for me over there before I can move in
[01:07:19] <EronGari> 1 upstairs, 1 in her room, and another for me
[01:07:22] <VerifiedShitlady> EronGari: 
[01:07:28] <VerifiedShitlady> I'm in Flint
[01:07:44] <EronGari> more work there?
[01:07:54] <EronGari> a better place to live
[01:07:56] <EronGari> ?
[01:07:58] <VerifiedShitlady> Shelter there
[01:08:20] <EronGari> oh, I see - but is that where you will be living next week?
[01:08:31] <VerifiedShitlady> Yes
[01:08:38] <EronGari> good, I guess
[01:08:40] <VerifiedShitlady> Until I get my apartment
[01:08:49] <EronGari> more opportunity
[01:09:11] <EronGari> oh, then back to the ...   your smaller town?
[01:09:21] <VerifiedShitlady> Nope
[01:09:25] <VerifiedShitlady> Never again
[01:09:31] <EronGari> will stay in Flint?
[01:09:40] <VerifiedShitlady> Near
[01:09:42] <EronGari> yeah, don't look back
[01:09:49] <VerifiedShitlady> Burton, technically
[01:09:54] <EronGari> ah
[01:09:55] <oath> hey EronGari
[01:09:58] <oath> long time 
[01:09:59] <EronGari> hey
[01:10:02] <oath> how goes the
[01:10:09] <EronGari> yea   I been hiding
[01:10:19] <oath> .-.
[01:10:41] <oath> i've fallen into a condumdrem
[01:10:43] <EronGari> well, dealing with it - have to camp at my casita so is why I am on here now
[01:10:50] <EronGari> oh?
[01:10:51] <oath> oh
[01:10:51] <oath> yeah
[01:10:58] <oath> was more open statement
[01:11:09] <oath> i've come to a point where i don't know how to answer what religion i am
[01:11:14] <oath> ._.;
[01:11:18] <oath> how is the resteraunts?
[01:11:24] <VerifiedShitlady> Pagan?
[01:11:31] <VerifiedShitlady> Spiritual?
[01:11:37] <oath> i don't know...
[01:11:39] <Edward> Christian?
[01:11:41] <EronGari> me neither, so I say 'mystic' now - no one can define it but it's magical
[01:11:48] <oath> definitly not even in the catagory of that
[01:11:53] <Edward> Gnostic?
[01:11:59] <oath> okay well it came like this
[01:12:04] <Edward> Islam?
[01:12:06] <Edward> Mormon?
[01:12:10] <oath> you know the basic freemason symbol ?
[01:12:20] <Edward> Hermetic?
[01:12:23] <oath> maybe
[01:12:28] <oath> i started to think about aliens
[01:12:31] <VerifiedShitlady> Herod does :^]
[01:12:36] <Edward> Thelema?
[01:12:37] <EronGari> wait, you have dietary restrictions?  can sometimes use that to define it
[01:12:45] <oath> aliens
[01:12:51] <oath> aliens
[01:12:55] <EronGari> taste like chicken
[01:13:01] <oath> i'd like to eat one too =X
[01:13:13] <EronGari> that is what you keep thinking if the 'greys' examine you
[01:13:21] <oath> i think that alien blood might get us higher than we've ever been
[01:13:23] <oath> no
[01:13:28] <oath> its more like
[01:13:32] <oath> their are aliens in this universe
[01:13:46] <oath> they must have religion at one point or
[01:13:51] <VerifiedShitlady> What if
[01:13:54] <oath> so then i thought like what if the aliens all came together
[01:13:57] <VerifiedShitlady> We're the aliens
[01:14:00] <oath> then they would have the idea of
[01:14:03] <oath> pure holy
[01:14:04] <EronGari> and 8 foot preying mantis types as old as our solar system seeding life here
[01:14:06] <oath> and pure evil
[01:14:10] <oath> but regardless
[01:14:21] <oath> the idea is that each brances down like a pyramid
[01:14:24] <oath> overlapping even
[01:14:29] <oath> and that the overlap is that
[01:14:37] <oath> sometimes evil has to happen for good
[01:14:41] <Edward> Zoroastrian?
[01:14:46] <oath> and good has to happen for evil
[01:14:54] <Edward> Mithraism?
[01:14:56] <oath> but then i looked closely into the aspect of evil
[01:15:09] <Edward> Sufi?
[01:15:20] <EronGari> yeah, it is reciprical, and both are necessary - entropy is important too
[01:15:21] <oath> and i don't think conventional religons touch the aspect 
[01:15:37] <oath> and i'm like
[01:15:41] <oath> if someone asked me what do i believe
[01:15:46] <oath> do i say aliens?
[01:15:53] <EronGari> no, they like black and white, good and evil - uselss way to view things
[01:15:57] <oath> yeah
[01:15:59] <oath> i know
[01:16:04] <oath> and i can't even begin to get into it
[01:16:14] <oath> like
[01:16:36] <oath> for example if somethings were opposite
[01:16:55] <oath> i could puke and we'd be all like eww... predigested goup
[01:17:10] <EronGari> no fun if you win every time, let the games begin
[01:17:16] <oath> but then to an alien they'd be like... holy shit these humans can dispense food
[01:17:32] <EronGari> my dog thinks like that
[01:17:36] <oath> mine too
[01:17:58] <oath> we pour them food and drink
[01:17:58] <EronGari> hock one into the garden and poogy chases after it
[01:18:03] <oath> why wouldn't we dispense food in other ways too
[01:18:47] <EronGari> yeah, and I try to explain to him I have human things to do so he can eat well, so he has to be patient when I leave for the store
[01:19:07] <VerifiedShitlady> I miss fagoterica
[01:19:20] <oath> its just
[01:19:31] <oath> what if their were gods who feasted on vomit
[01:19:33] <EronGari> is he still keeping low profile?  like non-existent?
[01:19:38] <oath> to us
[01:19:43] <oath> it sounds disrespectful
[01:19:46] <oath> out of the question
[01:19:48] <VerifiedShitlady> How would I know
[01:19:51] <oath> but to something we don't understand
[01:20:00] <oath> its just another thing for them
[01:20:23] <oath> weird shit
[01:20:25] <EronGari> well, greys 'eat' by 'lathering' themselves in snot food, sorta
[01:20:48] <oath> we haven't even scratched the service
[01:20:51] <oath> serfice?
[01:20:56] <oath> surface
[01:20:57] <oath> .
[01:21:14] <EronGari> you don't keep up with them, pom?   I thought you were still one of 'theirs'
[01:21:57] <oath> EronGari: you've rised through the ranks of AMORC?
[01:22:00] <oath> i think that was it
[01:22:26] <EronGari> I did that back in the 80's, and now I am re-treading it again
[01:22:37] <oath> awesome
[01:22:51] <oath> i have to wonder how much experience you have with astral projection and lusid dreaming
[01:23:05] <oath> or + if you've studied necromancy
[01:23:07] <EronGari> it is actually - looking back I think they were the most helpful and informative
[01:23:24] <EronGari> also, insisted you do the stuff and use it
[01:23:42] <oath> but you personally
[01:24:22] <EronGari> kind of doing the same things but calling it by different names - it is still working with mental powers
[01:24:32] <oath> well
[01:24:36] <oath> were i'm going with this is that
[01:24:45] <oath> i've once had a near death experience 
[01:25:06] <EronGari> too close for comfort, maybe?
[01:25:34] <oath> i started to go like if you want to call it whatever but i started to hallucinate i watched my spirit leave my body and was fully submerged something else
[01:25:36] <EronGari> that can be quite an experience
[01:25:42] <oath> so pretty fucking close to the edge
[01:26:09] <oath> there is a techinique i've seen and heard of and thought about quite deeply
[01:26:15] <EronGari> yeah...   right now I am afraid my next time near might not b3e a return
[01:26:34] <oath> and the original thought is that you can drown someone - essentially killing them - and then resesitate them back to life
[01:26:43] <oath> its risky 
[01:26:51] <EronGari> yeah, it would be
[01:26:51] <oath> and would need loads of preperation
[01:27:00] <oath> to even having an AED on hand
[01:27:06] <oath> but imagine that you could do that
[01:27:11] <oath> subject yourself to death
[01:27:14] <EronGari> and a way to get the hell out of there if it don't go right
[01:27:29] <oath> and do it so repeatedly that you can enter a lusid state and even explore it
[01:27:40] <EronGari> there are other ways
[01:27:47] <oath> as personal as this?
[01:27:49] <EronGari> less drastic
[01:28:15] <EronGari> worth considering trying first before that
[01:29:08] <EronGari> I need to recover right now, too close to a one-way trip if I went that route
[01:29:18] <oath> ?
[01:29:38] <EronGari> I was sick this year and still not quite back to myself yet
[01:30:47] <EronGari> too busy taking care of 'delicate' matters domestic - just in case - but my wife doesn't want to consider that, really
[01:31:21] <EronGari> so, Near-Death might just be pushing things a bit for the moment
[01:31:47] <EronGari> I might see that by accident, soon
[01:32:45] <EronGari> my 'training' is helping me get back to normal, but the body is just resilient to a point, especially whith age
[01:33:45] <oath> yep
[01:33:48] <oath> the spirit is willing
[01:33:50] <oath> the body...
[01:34:19] <EronGari> well, you can just abuse yourself so much and not expect to pay for it later
[01:34:24] <EronGari> now is later for me
[01:34:47] <oath> i know
[01:34:49] <oath> i've seen it
[01:35:06] <oath> but you seem to have a nice setup
[01:35:13] <Edward> i sexually abuse myself
[01:35:13] <EronGari> but actually I am doing remarkably well and almost functioning normally again
[01:35:30] <EronGari> can go blind doing that, I hear
[01:35:38] <Edward> well I do have to wear glasses
[01:35:45] <EronGari> yeah
[01:35:48] <Edward> Yep
[01:36:30] <EronGari> oh, you agree, Edward - blindness is a consequence?
[01:37:12] <Edward> I doubt it
[01:37:12] <EronGari> I am going blind, need reading glasses, and not even getting the self-abuse payoff
[01:37:34] <Edward> If blindness is a consequence most of the world would be effected
[01:37:50] <EronGari> yeah, just most would not admit it
[01:37:56] <Edward> ha!
[01:38:27] <EronGari> well, some things are better left in the closet, socially speaking
[01:38:45] <EronGari> don't ask, don't tell
[01:39:06] <Edward> Alright
[01:39:17] <EronGari> and just pretend we are all normal non-pervs
[01:39:37] <Edward> Everyone are pervs
[01:39:39] <Edward> Everyone....
[01:39:45] <EronGari> or maybe that is the problem in the world now -
[01:39:56] <EronGari> that we pretend
[01:40:40] <EronGari> you know, if you could jerk off on the bus...    not sure that would be pretty, but would be releasing
[01:41:13] <Edward> I knew someone in high school who masturbated at the back of the bus
[01:41:20] <Edward> I asked him about it before.
[01:41:27] <Edward> He said, I had morning wood so I masturbated
[01:41:54] <EronGari> well, sometimes you just got to take yourself at hand
[01:42:10] <EronGari> 3-4 times a day
[01:42:25] <Edward> Take yourself at hand
[01:42:26] <Edward> heh
[01:42:51] <EronGari> all your friends need is a helping hand
[01:43:03] <Edward> Unless they are hot chicks, im out
[01:43:35] <EronGari> ok, that is the way to keep the conversation to pretend normalcy
[01:43:42] *** Quits: Eugenios (Eugenios@sorcery-qlih83.ca.charter.com) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:45:14] <EronGari> so, anyway, not sure the bus thing is the way to go - the closet still has a door for a reason
[01:45:48] <EronGari> and uncool to say, some things better left there
[01:45:59] <EronGari> these days, uncool to say it
[01:46:37] <Edward> Sure.
[01:46:49] <EronGari> but, hey, a little discretion has value
[01:47:37] <Edward> Sure.
[01:48:43] <EronGari> so not being able to name your religion seems like small beans
[01:49:25] <Edward> oath
[01:49:35] <Edward> Just pinging him, so you guys can continue your conversation
[01:49:38] <Edward> :3
[01:49:58] <EronGari> I think that bus ran into a ditch
[01:51:02] <EronGari> What's uptight, outaa sight, and in the groove?
[01:51:08] <EronGari> a tampon
[01:51:15] <Edward> Nice
[01:52:05] <EronGari> and panty hose did much to end casual sex in the 60's
[01:54:53] <EronGari> in case you didn't know, they were a 60's invention - before that were individual stocking hose
[01:55:48] <Edward> Good to know.
[01:56:06] <EronGari> a CIA plot
[01:56:21] <EronGari> to rain on our parade
[01:56:46] <Edward> Erm
[01:56:48] <Edward> Okay
[01:57:03] <EronGari> more had to come off at the drive-in - that is why they all closed down now
[01:57:26] <EronGari> that and their crappy speaker box
[01:59:00] <EronGari> well, everntually you could get the sound with your radio there - but we'd just park outside and watch from across the street for free
[01:59:48] <oath> ?
[01:59:49] <oath> sorry
[02:00:19] <EronGari> in the 70's we all had CB radios and sent one car into the drive-in to transmit the sound back to the rst of us parked across the street watching the screen
[02:00:35] <Edward> Nice
[02:01:21] <EronGari> then T-hunt all night loing till daylight
[02:02:39] <EronGari> play hide-n-seek with one person hiding and transmitting while the rest of us went tracking his signal - then we'd drink beer and party till the last one showed up and sent another off to hide
[02:03:35] <EronGari> ah, those were the days - Ford was president and we all had extensions on our unemployment benefits - paid vacations days
[02:04:20] <EronGari> then when it ran out I packed off to Las Vegas to drive a taxt there
[02:04:29] <EronGari> taxi
[02:07:25] <EronGari> then in the 80's started my federal career
[02:07:56] <EronGari> 2006 retired and pensioned
[02:08:27] <EronGari> at age 53 - top that if you can
[02:21:35] <oath> man
[02:21:40] <oath> mexico
[02:21:46] <oath> i wonder
[02:22:14] <oath> what is the major criminal like problem their?
[02:22:15] <EronGari> budget paradise
[02:22:59] <EronGari> none really, like anywhere else, just be a little cautious - crime is worse in the US in my opinion
[02:23:13] <oath> i just
[02:23:15] <oath> from america
[02:23:21] <oath> it seems like drug cartles is the main issue
[02:23:28] <EronGari> people cooperate here more, ore live and let live, less judgment
[02:24:15] <EronGari> no, it was when the CIA was ramrodding the War on Drugs - it is their thing to perpetuate the black market profits of the drug trade
[02:24:34] <oath> aren't they though
[02:24:54] <oath> could you imagine if focus was taken off iraq and such and was focused on the drug cartles of the southern america
[02:25:05] <Woxxy_> VerifiedShitlady, 
[02:25:06] <oath> we'd ravage your crops and destoy the cocaine market
[02:25:08] <Woxxy_> c:
[02:25:27] <EronGari> prsident Calderon was handed the presidency, he didn't win in a close vote but the US govt didn;t want the other guy at all - it was all staged, the war on drugs thing - and that is over with now, or at least not a big deal
[02:25:50] <oath> the amount of money we make
[02:25:52] <oath> its absurd
[02:25:57] <oath> man
[02:25:59] <EronGari> yep
[02:26:00] <oath> the world is a fucking joke
[02:26:04] <oath> thats the conspiracy
[02:26:11] <EronGari> it is, but the joke is on us
[02:26:18] <EronGari> and we eat it up
[02:27:07] <EronGari> at least in Mexico the peop;e there are wise enough to never have trusted their politicians or govt lies - in the US we think they do no wrong
[02:27:07] <oath> blind
[02:27:13] <oath> muh
[02:27:17] <oath> are you kidding me
[02:27:24] <oath> this country was established when
[02:27:34] <oath> and at that time all the shit was just ideas
[02:27:37] <oath> we can create
[02:27:40] <oath> the perfect
[02:27:40] <oath> world
[02:27:42] <oath> muwhaha
[02:27:46] <oath> but now its bastardized
[02:27:48] <oath> its a joke
[02:27:58] <oath> 4 year terms for a country that takes centuries to align
[02:28:00] <EronGari> to live the american dream you have to be asleep - and they at least keep telling us bedtime stories
[02:28:06] <oath> nah
[02:28:10] <oath> you just have to know its a joke
[02:28:16] <oath> it opens doors
[02:29:15] <EronGari> yeah, we, many of us now, know it is a joke and a lie - and that is one reason I left the US - but for years everyone trusted thee govt
