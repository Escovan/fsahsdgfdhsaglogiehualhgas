[19:47:49] <Voltzen> whats new?
[19:48:06] <Pomegranate> Homeless
[19:48:32] <Voltzen> what! since when?
[19:49:27] <Pomegranate> February
[19:50:17] <Voltzen> oh wow... that sucks, what happened?
[19:51:44] <Pomegranate> Argument with my mom
[19:51:57] <Voltzen> damn
[19:52:29] <Voltzen> my parents want to sell this place 
[19:56:00] <Voltzen> they've been talking about moving to a 60+ community for about a year now, they said it's gonna happen when my dad retires which he's supposed to do this winter, but he's trying to get another year or so of work in which hopefully he does
[19:58:47] <Voltzen> Jay & I rent the top floor for $100 a week, he was trying to work something out with them so we can stay here after they move out but I doubt we'll be able to get up enough money in time especially if my dad retires this year
[20:02:33] <Voltzen> his boss has some rental properties which is probably where we'll end up going if we can't stay here... it sucks though cuz I always figured this house would be mine someday

[20:06:25] <Voltzen> we've been living here since 91, I was 6 when we moved in
[20:08:48] <Voltzen> the house is over 200 years old, it was a wreck when they bought it but my dad did a ton of work to renovate it
[20:31:11] <Pomegranate> I see

[20:59:14] <IronElk> Lol
[20:59:42] <Pomegranate> Congrats, Elken One
[21:00:52] <IronElk> I'm famous. Sort of
[21:03:21] <Pomegranate> People pissed on Trumps star
[21:06:45] <IronElk> Should have shit on it too
[21:07:01] <Pomegranate> They did that 
[21:28:32] <EronGari> What, you guyze are Cruz fans?
[21:29:52] <EronGari> just heard Cruz's dad was identified as one of the Cubans pictured in New Orleans with Lee Harvey Oswald in '63 - apparently another CIA op guy
[21:31:21] <EronGari> bothers me anyone related any way to the Dallas coup plot
[21:32:33] <EronGari> already had the son of another guy associated with all that, Bush, and he was no great prize
[21:33:03] <EronGari> reason enough to keep him out of the withe house
[21:33:22] <EronGari> white, even
[21:34:00] <EronGari> doesn't Cruz sort of look like Count Chocula?
[21:34:12] <IronElk> Lol
[21:34:19] <IronElk> He does now. Thanks
[21:35:29] <EronGari> if it were just looks that might not be a factor, just more facial recognition
[21:36:21] <Pomegranate> Cruz looks like a blood sucker
[21:36:53] <EronGari> got the right occupation for it - lawyer/politician
[21:37:45] <EronGari> Sanders is looking good in the polls - and if an indictment comes down for Hilary he is the logical one for the ballot
[21:38:25] <EronGari> it may come down to Sanders vs. Cruz
[21:38:27] <Pomegranate> What happened exactly last debate?
[21:38:50] <EronGari> missed it, just watched a week of poli while in the US a week ago
[21:39:04] <Pomegranate> Fine by me
[21:39:10] <Pomegranate> cruz isn't the worst
[21:39:18] <Pomegranate> I mean he's bad
[21:39:24] <Pomegranate> But not the worst
[21:39:40] <Pomegranate> Brb captain stinkypants has struck again
