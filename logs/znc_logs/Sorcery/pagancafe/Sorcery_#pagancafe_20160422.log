[00:00:00] <Eugenios> These are the two most recommended books by Kemetics that I've heard of, and I've read both
[00:00:12] <Eugenios> Eternal Egypt helped me construct my own standard primer
[00:00:20] <pomm> Cool
[00:00:24] <Eugenios> I'm still working through Temple of The Cosmos - it's got A LOT to digest
[00:00:24] <pomm> I have a Bast statue
[00:00:28] <Eugenios> Very cool
[00:00:37] <pomm> She's at my apartment
[00:00:44] <pomm> I'm at my mom's house now
[00:01:10] * Eugenios nods
[00:01:24] <Eugenios> I have three animal statuettes
[00:01:42] <Eugenios> Bastet, Heru (Horus), and Anpu/Yinepu (Anubis)
[00:02:47] <Eugenios> Would you like to see my Kemetic ritual space?
[00:05:53] <pomm> Yes
[00:07:04] <Eugenios> Here is my whole ritual space
[00:07:05] <Eugenios> http://i.imgur.com/uOeB2Vd.jpg
[00:07:50] <Eugenios> The green object is an oil warmer. I have smoke alarms, so my entire setup on both of my spaces have been converted to essential oils - which I like a lot better anyways
[00:08:14] <Eugenios> The bowl on the front right is for sacred water
[00:08:40] <Eugenios> The bowl on the front left is for libations - along with the green cup for the drink, and the shot glass for water libation
[00:09:16] <Eugenios> The bowls on the left and right of the main offer bowl are sand (left) and salt/natron (right) respectively
[00:09:31] <pomm> Cool!
[00:09:42] <Eugenios> The three wooden tiles represent the Three Sacred Objects. I wood-burned them myself
[00:09:48] <pomm> Once I get settled in I plan on expanding my altar
[00:09:56] <Eugenios> Here's a closeup of the three objects
[00:09:57] <Eugenios> http://i.imgur.com/S02i0bf.jpg
[00:10:04] <pomm> three sacred objects?
[00:10:06] <Eugenios> Ma'at, Ib (heart), and Ankh
[00:10:58] <Eugenios> They are used in ritual - presented to the netjer as a sort of offering
[00:11:11] <Eugenios> Here is a closeup of my statuary

[00:11:48] <pomm> They combine two of my favorite things: French and Celtic paganism
[00:11:55] <Eugenios> Neat
