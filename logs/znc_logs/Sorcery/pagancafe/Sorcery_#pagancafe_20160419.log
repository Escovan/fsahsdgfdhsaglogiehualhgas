[05:26:24] <Rajoguna_> we need a political room
[05:29:30] <Eugenios> Why?
[05:30:51] <Rajoguna_> so we can bash capitalism
[05:31:04] <Rajoguna_> and mock dumb trump, cruz and kasich supporters
[05:31:45] <Rajoguna_> the extremist GOP and the center right Democrats will be the death of america. we need a hero. we need a champion of the masses.
[05:33:12] <Rajoguna_> we need to prosecute wallstreet
[05:33:18] <Eugenios> So you can propagandize then
[05:33:26] <Rajoguna_> and hang congress
[05:33:35] <Rajoguna_> i only speak the truth
[05:33:42] <Rajoguna_> why would anyone have any reason to lie
[05:33:44] <Eugenios> You know who also says that?
[05:33:52] <Eugenios> Fundamentalists
[05:33:53] <Rajoguna_> death to the classes long live the masses
[05:34:01] <Rajoguna_> the GOP are fundamentalists
[05:34:12] <Rajoguna_> fun they are not, da mentalists they are
[05:34:16] <Rajoguna_> fun-da-mentalistws
[05:34:31] <Rajoguna_> we need to tax churches
[05:35:23] <Rajoguna_> tell me when have left wing extremists in america ever terrorized anyone? never. right wing extemeists? all the time. they shoot up planned parenthoods, they shoot up black churches, they attack Sikh temples, ect
[05:35:45] <Rajoguna_> more KKK members attack americans for racism than terrorists from the middle east attack americans
[05:35:59] <Rajoguna_> but dont get me wrong some of those damn countries are barbaric as fudge
[05:36:11] <Rajoguna_> because they are conservative and can get away with what much of the GOP wants
[05:36:18] <Rajoguna_> as they dont have any real liberalism
[05:36:22] <Rajoguna_> its all theocracy
[05:36:27] <Rajoguna_> just like the christians and dominionists want
[05:36:35] <Rajoguna_> ted cruz is in bed with the dominionists
[05:37:04] <Eugenios> And yet liberals are constantly making excuses for extremism in the middle east - focusing entirely on the first world problems of Christians with opinions they don't like
[05:37:16] <Rajoguna_> they are not real liberals those are the center right democrats
[05:37:28] <Rajoguna_> the christians are no different than the radicals thats the truth.
[05:37:37] <Rajoguna_> the only difference is that the government mostly keeps the christians in check
[05:37:46] <Rajoguna_> like the animals that they are.
[05:38:16] <Eugenios> No wonder you named yourself Rajoguna
[05:38:21] <Rajoguna_> Why's that?
[05:38:32] <Eugenios> You have a lot of hate in your heart
[05:38:36] <Eugenios> A lot of attachment
[05:38:53] <Rajoguna_> You know nothing of the ancient dark ways.
[05:39:47] <Rajoguna_> Do you dare speak blasphemies against the unholy magisty?
[05:39:55] <Rajoguna_> of which we should all venerate
[05:40:03] <Rajoguna_> you know you wanna Eugenios 
[05:40:33] <Rajoguna_> you know deep down, that Islam and Christianity are cancers of the world.
[05:41:04] <Rajoguna_> And that the only real solution is a theological genocide through mass deconvertion and dethroning of their influence on politics.
[05:41:14] <Rajoguna_> deconversion*
[05:41:47] <Eugenios> That's what Militant Atheists believe
[05:41:59] <Rajoguna_> Is that even relevant?
[05:42:02] <Rajoguna_> you know its the truth
[05:42:17] <Rajoguna_> besides when do militant atheists shoot up churches? only conservatives do that. and its usually out of racism or hatred
[05:42:25] <Rajoguna_> christians shoot the sikh churches and the mosques
[05:42:32] <Rajoguna_> and beat up indian hindus thinking they are muslims
[05:42:41] <Rajoguna_> and muslims fly planes into buildings and blow up places in paris
[05:42:49] <Rajoguna_> and kill millions in their own regions
[05:43:00] <Rajoguna_> who has ever killed in the name of atheism?
[05:43:36] <Rajoguna_> tell me Eugenios if I am full of hate why Have I not advocated violence?
[05:43:52] <Rajoguna_> I have only advocated for action of words and dethroning of privillaged positons of power.
[05:44:04] <Rajoguna_> if that is hate, what do you call the murderous intentions of those religions that hold that sway?
[05:44:09] <Rajoguna_> where in russia gays are killed
[05:44:18] <Rajoguna_> or in Uganda
[05:44:25] <Rajoguna_> or how christians are killed even by muslims
[05:44:29] <Rajoguna_> and muslims killed by christians
[05:44:56] <Rajoguna_> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDwgI_H7Psg
[05:45:25] <Rajoguna_> if you cannt see this difference you have blinded yourself
[05:45:34] <Rajoguna_> tell me Eugenios if i am full of hate where is my advocation of violence?
[05:45:41] <Rajoguna_> i have none, they have plenty and act on it regularly
[05:49:39] <Eugenios> violence is never as simple as a particular ideology
[05:49:54] <Eugenios> Especially the kind that turns people against one another 
[05:51:41] <Eugenios> There was slavery and human sacrifice long before Christianity and Islam, and many of the reasons for their abolition had little to do with any particular religion. It's unfortunate that religions like Christianity and Islam codified them into their orthodoxy, but that's something that had more to do with consolidation of imperial power than much of the other more social justifications
[05:52:19] <Rajoguna_> they act as a logical conseqence of their violence all the time.
[05:52:40] <Rajoguna_> to act as if it does not have a major role is intellectual dishonesty.
[05:53:34] <Rajoguna_> I am simply the blade by which the truth speaks; acting only in hatred as a sacred act. I have no part in spilling blood in this context.
[05:58:02] <Eugenios> I do agree with you that Christianity and Islam (most especially the latter), have been, and continue to be detrimental forces within the world. The extent to which, and the means and approach to dealing with them, are where we clearly differ. 
[05:58:10] *** Rajoguna_ is now known as Rajoguna
[06:00:36] <Eugenios> There are many Christians and even Muslims that I call friends. And my experience has been, by in large, that by being respectful to them and their beliefs, despite disagreement (and often in spite of opposition), has been a far more effective agent of carving a space for myself and the traditions I find sacred. That is my approach
[06:02:08] <Eugenios> When Christians find out that I am ambivalent to their religion, it so often takes the wind out of their sails. They are accustomed to being met with angry and accusatory responses from non-christians (and especially Atheists)
[06:02:48] <Eugenios> I have completely derailed attempts at conversion when I have diminished their belief to "simply the cult of a single god of many"
[06:04:45] <Eugenios> And moreover, when I remind them the equal protections of my faith traditions guaranteed under the law, and how their often constant complaints about their religion being attacked, it is very difficult for them to be disregarded as irrational selfish hypocrites (which is far too common)
[06:05:06] <Eugenios> to not be*
