[21:53:04] <ObiWanCanBlowMe> Hahahhaaa
[21:53:07] <Edward> I read alittle bit of the magicians companion... added a ton of books to my to read list.
[21:53:13] <IronElk> Ew
[21:53:19] <ObiWan> Good Edward
[21:53:23] *** ObiWan is now known as Pomegranate
[21:53:25] <Edward> GOOOOOOooood
[21:53:43] <Pomegranate> It's a good book
[21:53:47] <Edward> Indeed it is
[21:53:51] <Edward> Im crawling through it
[21:54:00] * Pomegranate nods
[21:54:09] <ObiWanCanBlowMe> I'm reading the Asatru Edda right now
[21:54:26] <Edward> Awesome.
[21:55:31] <ObiWanCanBlowMe> It's honestly hard to grasp the traditional Nordic spellings but it's going alright
[21:55:49] <Edward> Have you read the Chisholm Edda?
[21:56:10] <ObiWanCanBlowMe> Nope
[21:56:20] <Edward> Its a good translation, but what I like about it most is its notes
[21:57:52] <Edward> A physical copy might be hard to find
[21:57:55] <ObiWanCanBlowMe> Interesting. I thought the odinic edda was the translation
[21:58:10] <Edward> Hm?
[21:58:53] <Edward> Well poop on me, I didnt know about this version
[21:59:30] <ObiWanCanBlowMe> I actually found the asatru edda at my local music store
[21:59:33] * ObiWanCanBlowMe shrugs
[22:01:12] <Edward> Music store, aye
[22:01:13] <Pomegranate> Cool
[22:01:20] <Edward> Curious place for such a tome
[22:01:50] <ObiWanCanBlowMe> They've recently added a book section with a religious section
[22:02:16] <Edward> Expanding beyond the musics.
[22:03:05] <Edward> So, Pomegranate, how do you do magick. What are your methods
[22:03:25] <Pomegranate> Uhh
[22:03:28] <Pomegranate> Meaning?
[22:04:08] <Edward> I mean, do you go about the rituals by the book, or do you visualize alot
[22:04:11] <Edward> Or....
[22:04:22] <Edward> Tell me of your ways
[22:04:22] <Pomegranate> I usually do a chant in rhyme under the moon
[22:04:30] <Edward> I see
[22:04:39] <Pomegranate> Or a rhyme and offering to Bast
[22:04:50] <Edward> Bast is your Matron?
[22:05:04] <Pomegranate> Yes She is
[22:05:14] <Edward> Thats cool.
[22:05:27] <Edward> I visualize alot and make up my own spells. 
[22:05:34] <Edward> I find it works best when im laying in bed
[22:05:45] <Edward> Because im comfortable and not fully awake
[22:05:54] <Edward> Like in an altered state, ya know
[22:06:18] <Edward> I draw out the essence from within myself
[22:06:27] <Edward> And then visualize it.
[22:06:38] <Edward> Like when I do the Kabbalistic cross and such
[22:06:40] * Pomegranate nods
[22:06:51] <Pomegranate> I also do mental stuffs at random
[22:07:19] <Edward> Cool-sauce
[22:07:32] <Pomegranate> I do the LBRP as instructed
[22:07:54] * Edward nods
[22:07:59] <Pomegranate> I should do that
[22:08:43] <Edward> Do all the things
[22:10:15] * Pomegranate kicks Edward
[22:10:20] <Edward> Ouch
