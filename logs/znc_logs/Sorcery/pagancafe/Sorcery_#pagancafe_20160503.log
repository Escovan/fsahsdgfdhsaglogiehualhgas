[20:21:27] <Rajoguna> ?
[20:21:40] <Rajoguna> been working on music only now noticed ping
[20:22:35] <VerifiedShitlady> Rajoguna: you know Allison/dearg?
[20:23:01] <Rajoguna> not really
[20:23:35] <Rajoguna> I don't know anyone by that name on IRC but i might of seen an allision on here in the past
[20:23:48] <VerifiedShitlady> You know OF her?
[20:24:11] <Edward> Rajoguna, lets make a humonculus together
[20:24:14] <Rajoguna> Vaguely I recall some Allison or some name like that stirring up shit years ago in #Pagan back when Newf owned it
[20:24:22] <Rajoguna> what's a humoclus?
[20:24:34] <VerifiedShitlady> EDNERD
[20:24:34] <Rajoguna> ive not been very active on irc the last few months mostly focusing on other stuff
[20:24:37] <Edward> Kinda like an articfical human
[20:24:41] <Rajoguna> ah
[20:24:46] <Rajoguna> so a robot
[20:24:48] <Edward> No
[20:24:52] <Edward> Its organic
[20:24:59] <Rajoguna> I heard some dudes at a monestary made a monk robot
[20:25:19] <Edward> Let my cum drip out of your anal passage
[20:25:24] <Edward> A monk robot, aye?
[20:26:21] <VerifiedShitlady> I have a tootsie roll pop
[20:26:37] <Edward> I have a boner
[20:26:41] <VerifiedShitlady> Ok
[20:27:06] * Edward sticks it into gloryhole
[20:27:45] <Edward> Rajoguna, how long was it that umm #pagan belonged to Newf
[20:27:55] <Edward> 5 - years?
[20:28:24] <Rajoguna> I'm not sure. Let me do some maths.
[20:28:29] <VerifiedShitlady> Lol.ew
[20:28:44] <Rajoguna> I think I came to this network in 2013.
[20:28:59] <Edward> So even less than five years, aye
[20:29:11] <Rajoguna> He owned it for at least 1 year I think
[20:29:22] <Rajoguna> before holding onto it for ages
[20:29:45] <Edward> I heard about that
[20:29:50] <Edward> Why wouldnt he let it go?
[20:30:00] <Rajoguna> He was petty and claimed he wanted to use it eventually
[20:30:01] <Edward> A safetynet in case occultus failed or something?
[20:30:05] <Edward> Oh I see
[20:30:11] <Rajoguna> Really it came down to he didn't want to relinguish control to Alaren
[20:30:22] <Rajoguna> as he saw him and his wife as goddless/magicless atheists
[20:30:37] <Edward> I see...
[20:31:34] <Rajoguna> He didn't like that the channel became what it did. He wanted it to be like #witches but with his own touches. The community that had grown there just wanted it to be what it was, a bunch of witches, weirdos and cool people being friends and having small talk and fun.
[20:32:19] <Edward> What was witches
[20:32:21] <Rajoguna> it was really active. we brought in new people from witches and other channels and networks that didn't like the more stringent rules. we were really laid back and didnt have too much of an issue most of the time with eachother. it was also a place to vent and talk about magic without feeling like being on eggshells
[20:32:44] <Edward> Seems pretty empty now a days
[20:32:45] <Edward> A shame
[20:33:01] <Rajoguna> #witches is still around of course. when Mal owned it it was basically a kid friendly PG rated channel for talking about witchcraft and wicca. i dont know who owned it before him he wasnt around much so MCMLXV was the de facto owner for ages
[20:33:02] *** Joins: Eugenios (Eugenios@sorcery-hvemon.ca.charter.com)
[20:33:34] <Rajoguna> ya sadly after newf and amira took over they fucked up everything
[20:33:39] <Edward> Mim owned it when I came on here, but she gave it to that MCMLXV dude .
[20:33:50] <Rajoguna> if they would of stayed on this network and whoever owned the domain name didnt let it expire it would of kept things going for ages
[20:33:59] <Rajoguna> ya Mim owned it for a while
[20:34:16] <Rajoguna> the domain name was at the top of google rankings and search results
[20:34:23] <Rajoguna> it actually helped the entire network stay active.
[20:34:58] <Edward> Not all the shits is fucked, yo
[20:35:04] <Rajoguna> now a lot of activity is driven by channels like #exalted and RP
[20:35:08] <VerifiedShitlady> Occultus is getting better
[20:35:22] <Edward> Occultus seems pretty much the same to me
[20:35:28] <Edward> If you mean traffic
[20:35:32] <Rajoguna> the only one i know now thats still active is the 2 succubus channels and of course #square but thats mostly idlers
[20:36:02] <Rajoguna> bt this was always an RP network
[20:36:14] <Rajoguna> primarily anyway
[20:36:22] <Edward> What other network has occult stuffs
[20:36:32] <VerifiedShitlady> Paganpaths
[20:36:36] <Rajoguna> that an ERPchannel. dunno what happened to all the hypnosis channels they might still be around lol
[20:36:36] <Edward> Im there, bruh
[20:36:47] <Rajoguna> that and*
[20:36:58] <Edward> Im on occultus, paganpaths and of course sorcery here
[20:37:16] <Rajoguna> its really bizzare how some people are in like viritually every occult channel ever
[20:38:07] <Rajoguna> dat cccy_regeanwolfe guy is like that. so is that kindone and kindtwo ive seen around
[20:38:11] <Rajoguna> no fucking idea who they are after years
[20:38:17] <Rajoguna> never seen them talk
[20:38:27] <Edward> I think cccy_regeanawolfe is nsa
[20:39:22] <Rajoguna> If the NSA wanted to see what people were saying on IRC they would just get the logs somehow. Really all the NSA collecting was with the cooperation of phone prodiers and email providers
[20:39:24] <Rajoguna> providers*
[20:39:41] <Rajoguna> Verizon and Yahoo in particular
[20:40:04] <Edward> Pfft, yahoo
[20:40:08] <Rajoguna> So I dont see how they would get the logs without cooperation of the people who owned the network, with the exception of stealing the logs but I dont think their efforts include that.
[20:40:20] <VerifiedShitlady> Pfft Verizon
[20:40:23] <Edward> Thats there cccy comes in
[20:42:18] <VerifiedShitlady> Newf is all upset because of the shit dearg causes
[20:42:21] <VerifiedShitlady> Caused
[20:42:50] <Edward> Yes
[20:43:19] <Edward> And it was all because you were allowed into occultus, pom
[20:43:28] <VerifiedShitlady> I knew she was horrible
[20:43:35] <VerifiedShitlady> I knew she was.scum
[20:43:41] <VerifiedShitlady> But did anyone listen?
[20:43:43] <VerifiedShitlady> NOPE
[20:44:01] <Edward> I knew your butt was loose 
[20:44:07] <Edward> I knew your butt was flowing
[20:44:10] <Edward> But did anyone listen!?
[20:44:14] <Edward> NOPE
[20:44:19] <Edward> now look at this mess!

[20:44:26] <Edward> ALL OVER THE PALCE!
[20:45:48] <VerifiedShitlady> No
[20:45:56] <Rajoguna> That reminds some employees did convince the NSA to let them play world of warcraft saying they might catch terrorists using its chat function to get around spying

[23:35:44] <EronGari> heya pommie
[23:35:50] <Pomegranate> Hi
[23:36:04] <Pomegranate> Allison can die of beetus
[23:36:11] <Pomegranate> Or firing squad
[23:36:15] <Pomegranate> either works
[23:36:16] <EronGari> another day in bidget paradise - got your apartment now?
[23:36:27] <EronGari> budget
[23:36:31] <EronGari> *
[23:37:01] <Pomegranate> Yes
[23:37:10] <EronGari> I am in the budget paradise
[23:37:15] <Pomegranate> Allison wouldn't be a difficult target
[23:37:20] <EronGari> didn't mean you
[23:38:04] <Pomegranate> She claimed that I made her starve herself
[23:38:06] <EronGari> she stirred things up last night
[23:38:13] <Pomegranate> she could stand to miss a meal or twenty
[23:38:16] <Pomegranate> Here????
[23:38:21] <EronGari> she could
[23:38:25] <EronGari> no, occuntus
[23:38:32] <Pomegranate> Ah
[23:38:35] <Pomegranate> Yes
[23:38:38] <EronGari> blew Newf's cover
[23:38:42] <Pomegranate> And because of that
[23:38:46] <Pomegranate> I'M BANNED
[23:38:59] <EronGari> why you?  she did the deed
[23:39:21] <Pomegranate> Continuation of previous ban
[23:39:22] <EronGari> but did gripe you were evading her ban
[23:39:30] <EronGari> yeah
[23:39:37] <Pomegranate> The ban newf lifted?
[23:39:44] <EronGari> well, I am perma-glined
[23:39:49] <Pomegranate> Me too
[23:39:51] <EronGari> yeah, that one
[23:40:13] <EronGari> now that I don't understand - Newf can lift bans
[23:40:26] <EronGari> but he reimposed it with a gline??
[23:40:31] <Pomegranate> Well amira said she MIGHT let me in IF she sees that I'm calmer on fb messenger
[23:40:57] <EronGari> you are a calmer person than when we first met - that is truth
[23:41:24] <Pomegranate> New meds
[23:41:38] <EronGari> I think being out of your mom's home helped chill you into a regular person - but don't overdo it, we like you sassy
[23:41:50] <Pomegranate> Fuck I ain't regular
[23:41:56] <Pomegranate> I got major depressive disorder
[23:41:57] <Pomegranate> always will
[23:42:29] <EronGari> meds, me too, but different kind - hope I can do without mine in a few weeks or so
[23:42:50] <EronGari> well, we love you
[23:43:06] <EronGari> Amira is active again?
[23:43:21] <Pomegranate> Allison told amira
[23:43:25] <Pomegranate> Via fb I think
[23:43:33] <Pomegranate> amira told newf to ban me
[23:43:35] <Pomegranate> BAM
[23:43:38] <EronGari> I should ask her...   naw, I am better off not there, but I have a lot of respect for Amira
[23:44:09] <Pomegranate> Amira is a good person
[23:44:13] <Pomegranate> so is newf
[23:44:23] <Pomegranate> In his weird Canadian way
[23:44:23] <EronGari> Amira is a tough cookie, but she gets a soft spot for us
[23:45:04] <EronGari> well, I have another opinion, they didn't treat me right, Newf and Eso
[23:45:22] <Aria> :(
[23:45:43] <Pomegranate> Hey Aria 
[23:45:46] <Aria> Allison told a few people that I am in a relationship with newfoundlandsol
[23:45:49] <Aria> I mean.. seriously
[23:45:49] <Pomegranate> Don't worry about me
[23:46:03] <Pomegranate> I'll be fine
[23:46:03] <Pomegranate> Really
[23:46:09] <EronGari> initially I was not glined, but for Biscuit asking where you were and me telling him, on a quiet channel, I advertised, so perma-gline
[23:46:10] <Aria> okay...
[23:46:55] <EronGari> she only told me he was hitting on you, Aria
[23:46:57] <Pomegranate> Jesus Fuck
[23:47:07] <Pomegranate> Wtf
[23:47:13] <Pomegranate> She's psycho
[23:47:24] <Pomegranate> A literal psychopath
[23:47:29] <EronGari> but we all hit on each other, isn't that normal??
[23:47:44] <Pomegranate> Ohhhh EronGari ;)
[23:48:04] <EronGari> well, no one hits on me, but I'm of another time
[23:49:14] <EronGari> said those nudes were not of her - so far I never seena pic of Amira
[23:49:44] <EronGari> probably wasn't Newf's dick either
[23:49:51] <discojack> you've sent me nudes erongari
[23:49:54] <discojack> whatre you talking about
[23:50:02] <discojack> it was because i was hitting on you
[23:50:13] <EronGari> lol, never, I don't have any - got some?
[23:50:23] <discojack> no I don't 
[23:50:38] <EronGari> you shit-canned them?
[23:50:40] <discojack> I used to have this really weird one 
[23:50:48] <discojack> where i was wearing a hat skarf combo thing 
[23:50:56] <discojack> and like, the skarf covered up my private bits
[23:51:13] <EronGari> well, keep those to yourself
[23:51:21] <discojack> yea i deleted them
[23:51:28] <discojack> they are floating somewhere on the fringes of the internet if at all
[23:51:40] <EronGari> plenty out there
[23:51:48] <discojack> yea im not even that good looking 
[23:51:50] <discojack> i did it as a gag
[23:52:04] <discojack> then kind of went with an idea, that we were goign to make a nude calender 
[23:52:10] <discojack> of just a bunch of weird shit
[23:52:13] <discojack> but that never took off.
[23:52:22] <discojack> yet another reason why I don't associate myself with them
[23:52:23] <EronGari> if I still had horny hormones left I might have some, but that was long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away 
[23:52:23] <discojack> no fun
[23:52:25] <discojack> no fun at all
[23:52:53] <discojack> when you were the rebel leader erongari ?
