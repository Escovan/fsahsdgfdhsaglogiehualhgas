[00:00:33] <Eugenios> Not particularly, but we're talking about the DMV here
[00:00:41] <discojack> yea
[00:00:49] <discojack> i went in for tabs and didnt have to wait at all 
[00:00:54] <discojack> rather quick, but its a 1k town
[00:01:04] <Eugenios> I live in a 2k town
[00:01:07] <discojack> on a monday afternoon
[00:01:17] <EronGari> no one likes to deal with state agencies - alway an ordeal or wait
[00:01:17] <Eugenios> But DMVs are sparse out her
[00:01:17] <discojack> er, morning i suppose
[00:01:19] <Eugenios> So it gets people from multiple cities
[00:01:20] <discojack> yea
[00:01:28] <discojack> just wait until you get to go into a social security facility 
[00:01:41] <discojack> you may already have
[00:01:42] <Pomegranate> Heehe
[00:01:44] <discojack> i don't like those places
[00:01:53] <Pomegranate> Me either
[00:02:02] <discojack> i couldn't even bring a bottle opener, which was on a keychain
[00:02:03] <EronGari> I live in a city of about 800,000 but we have about a dozen motor vehicle offices
[00:02:16] <discojack> i just had to get a new social security card
[00:02:17] <discojack> thats all
[00:02:26] <discojack> or some kind of proof of my social number 
[00:02:37] <EronGari> passport
[00:02:51] <EronGari> or is it on there?
[00:02:53] <discojack> nah i literally needed exactly my SS card
[00:02:53] <EronGari> forgot
[00:02:59] <discojack> I don't have a passport
[00:03:06] <EronGari> I lost mine 50 years ago
[00:03:16] <EronGari> never was a big deal then
[00:03:34] <EronGari> never was id intil after I started my career and retired
[00:03:58] <EronGari> I have passport, but no SS card
[00:04:23] <EronGari> didn't even have my whole name, I just put down initials and last name
[00:04:49] <EronGari> then wehn I joined the army it just started becoming our service number too
[00:05:15] <EronGari> need a passport if you want to leave the US
[00:05:32] <EronGari> was not a big deal a few years ago but it is now
[00:05:57] <discojack> yea
[00:06:03] <discojack> i was thinking of getting it 
[00:06:09] <discojack> because I want to visit a friend in canada
[00:06:19] <EronGari> I just made my first trip out of Mexico, to the US, in 9 years
[00:06:19] <discojack> eventually I'll get out of the US 
[00:06:23] <discojack> oh?
[00:06:25] <discojack> how was that?
[00:06:35] <EronGari> spent a week in California - that was enough
[00:06:57] <discojack> haha
[00:07:12] <discojack> they're starting to use automated mcdonalds over there
[00:07:19] <discojack> computers serve you
[00:07:36] <EronGari> was sick then and visiting my mother - used wheelchair service at the airports - the way to go, breezed through immigrations and customs
[00:07:46] <discojack> haha cool
[00:07:59] <EronGari> computers are cheaper than employees
[00:08:05] <discojack> oh yea
[00:08:07] <EronGari> and make fewer mistakes
[00:08:18] <discojack> most businesses still only use ARM processors as well, embedded technologies 
[00:08:24] <EronGari> some drive-throughs use people online at home 
[00:08:29] <discojack> for even sometimes their point of sale systems
[00:08:34] <discojack> oh ?
[00:08:36] <EronGari> at the squawk box
[00:08:42] <discojack> wasn't aware of that
[00:09:13] <discojack> i know they use an automated message at most mcdonalds now 
[00:09:13] <EronGari> yeah, they can get the order and put it up for the servers without even being there
[00:09:26] <discojack> they're trying to curb the way people feel about hearing automated messages 
[00:09:32] <discojack> because it's eventually goign to be the way to go
[00:10:57] <EronGari> the world has changed since I came into it
[00:11:05] <EronGari> and keeps changing
[00:11:20] <discojack> you're not missing much
[00:11:42] <EronGari> yeah, it's not all better
[00:11:48] <EronGari> but it is different
[00:12:11] <discojack> some day
[00:12:20] <discojack> or its to belize
[00:12:28] <EronGari> the 30-minute TV dinner is now a microwave meal and only takes a commercial break and not the whole sitcom
[00:12:53] <EronGari> if you go with me to the coast after getting here you may want to settle here awhile
[00:13:29] <EronGari> Nexpa, a little beach town with the Mary Jane Cafe and a surfers' paradise - rolling papers on the menu
[00:13:32] <discojack> that would be nice
[00:13:55] <EronGari> a timy town not on most maps
[00:14:00] <EronGari> tiny*
[00:14:16] <discojack> it may be a possibility 
[00:14:29] <discojack> i'm machining footstops for a guy who makes longboard decks 
[00:14:34] <discojack> he's goign to resell them
[00:14:44] <EronGari> it is a three-hour drive to the coast, another hor or so to Nexpa
[00:14:47] <EronGari> hour*
[00:15:12] <discojack> we may not want to drive much hahh
[00:15:17] <discojack> a break would be good
[00:16:03] <EronGari> they have an international surfing tourney there in Nexpa - read the magazines and you might hear about it - long rides, increadible long breakers
[00:16:19] <discojack> cool
[00:16:24] <discojack> recently i've gotten into longboarding
[00:16:35] <discojack> i finally got my full helmet too , i really like how it looks 
[00:16:41] <discojack> its hand made from brazil
[00:16:51] <discojack> i havent gone down a hill with it on yet though
[00:17:00] <EronGari> it is along a sandbar at the mouth of the Nexpa River
[00:17:01] <discojack> i was waiting until it came around
