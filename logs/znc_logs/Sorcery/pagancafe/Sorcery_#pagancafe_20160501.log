[19:30:04] <Pomegranate> Blessed Beltane!
[19:30:29] <kbot_> Hey thanks
[19:32:04] <kbot_> What is Beltane exactly?
[19:32:21] <Pomegranate> Union of the god and goddess
[19:32:39] <kbot_> Oh cool
[19:32:54] <Pomegranate> Aka sex
[19:32:57] <IronElk> Bit more than that
[19:33:04] <Pomegranate> True
[19:33:11] <Pomegranate> But still sex
[19:33:25] <IronElk> Sex is not the point of Beltaine
[19:33:43] <IronElk> Only for those who need an excuse to sleep around
[19:33:43] <kbot_> Can it be?
[19:33:50] <kbot_> Ha
[19:33:58] <Pomegranate> Hehe
[19:34:14] <kbot_> What is the point of Beltane, IronElk ?
[19:35:04] <IronElk> La Beltaine is the Celtic fire festival. It celebrates the coming of spring and the renewal of all life. This includes procreation, but procreation on a worldwide level. Meaning not only the tribe but also the animals and crops.
[19:35:27] <kbot_> Sounds like Easter
[19:35:32] <kbot_> Kind of
[19:35:37] <IronElk> A bit
[19:35:43] <Pomegranate> Ostara is more like Easter iirc
[19:36:08] <IronElk> I'm sure there was plenty of naked shenanigans
[19:36:35] <IronElk> But it was also necessary for the survival of the tribe
[19:36:54] <IronElk> With 7 billion people on the planet, it's not so important now
[19:37:29] <IronElk> You also have much more of a concern now when it comes to diseases
[19:37:38] <Pomegranate> ^
[19:37:42] <kbot_> Maybe we'll advance space travel to a quicker pace if we have more sex
[19:37:44] <Pomegranate> Condoms yo
[19:38:01] <Pomegranate> They don't protect against pregnancy but do against STDs
[19:38:05] <IronElk> Condoms aren't always effective. 
[19:38:10] <IronElk> They can break
[19:38:16] <Pomegranate> My kid is proof
[19:38:27] <kbot_> Lol
[19:38:55] <IronElk> Damnit Pom we've covered this. Even condom manufacturers don't claim it's 100% effective
[19:38:57] <kbot_> This is why I'm still a virgin
[19:39:01] <IronElk> Stubborn turd
[19:39:32] <Pomegranate> Heh
[19:39:49] <IronElk> Me too. My kids were all immaculate conceptions
[19:39:58] <Pomegranate> How's psychopomp?
