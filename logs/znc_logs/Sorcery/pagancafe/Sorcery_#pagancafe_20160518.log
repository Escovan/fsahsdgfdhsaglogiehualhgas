[16:11:44] <Eugenios> How are you?
[16:11:59] <Cetu> Annoyed but well
[16:12:02] <Cetu> You?
[16:12:11] <Eugenios> Great
[16:12:35] <Eugenios> My best friend and I loaded a custom ROM onto my phone after we bootloader it last night
[16:12:39] <Eugenios> It is AWESOME
[16:12:45] <Eugenios> bootloaded*
[16:14:17] <Cetu> Cool
[16:14:53] <Eugenios> And it's an upgrade to the next form of Android OS
[16:14:55] <Eugenios> Marshmallow
[16:15:14] * Cetu is not tech literate
[16:16:42] <Eugenios> Look at it this way: My phone likely won't get the newer software. By going through the trouble to customize it, I increased the longevity of my device until I get a new device
[16:16:56] <Eugenios> It's a great contingency, despite the risks of rooting (which voids the warranty)
[16:17:07] <Cetu> Ah ok
[16:17:31] <Cetu> I must be an old soul because that stuff doesn't interest me at all lol
[16:18:00] <Cetu> I'd rather read Merlin and other shit
[16:18:05] <Eugenios> I'm a Techno Pagan
[16:18:19] <Eugenios> One foot in futurism and another in the ancient past
[16:18:27] <Eugenios> I'm ultra traditional in my religious practice
[16:18:36] <Cetu> Ah ok
[16:21:54] <Cetu> I'm more ancient in spirituality but modern in practice
