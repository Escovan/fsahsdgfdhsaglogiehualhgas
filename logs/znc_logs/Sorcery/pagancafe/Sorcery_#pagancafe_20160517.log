[02:53:10] <Edward> I feel like telling this spiritsong to shut her bitch ass mouth and mind her own business
[02:53:21] <Aria> I feel like telling Edward to stop trolling
[02:53:36] <Edward> Im not trolling, I think you are acting like an idiot
[02:54:17] <Cetu> I'm so confused
[02:54:23] <Cetu> aria pls explain
[02:54:31] <Aria> Cetu
[02:54:33] <Aria> basically
[02:54:37] <Aria> I was getting a massive surge of energy
[02:54:41] <Aria> that just wouldn't stop
[02:54:48] <Aria> and I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to control it
[02:54:56] <Cetu> Well
[02:55:00] <Aria> until eventually, I grounded into the earth, and started constantly dumping energy
[02:55:03] <Cetu> FWIW
[02:55:06] <Aria> that helped, a lot
[02:55:14] <Cetu> You can always dump it in here
[02:55:33] <Cetu> Also I hate that room
[02:55:38] <Cetu> full of fluff
[02:55:47] <Aria> You should've told me that earlier, I was dumping it into people who wanted me to dump it
[02:55:51] <Aria> They all became just as hyperactive as me
[02:55:53] <Cetu> And the ops are arseholez
[02:55:54] <Aria> For a few minutes
[02:55:57] <Aria> THen they crashed
[02:56:01] <Cetu> Well, you know for next time
[02:56:16] <Aria> Next time I need to give them a gradual flow of energy
[02:56:18] <Aria> not a blast of enegy
[02:56:20] <Aria> energy*
[02:56:43] <Aria> I was like...
[02:56:47] <Aria> I got all of my crystals
[02:56:48] <Cetu> If you ever need to dump
[02:56:48] <Cetu> Do so here
[02:56:55] <Aria> charged one every time I felt hyper
[02:57:02] <Aria> I would be normal for 1 minute
[02:57:08] <Aria> and then I would start being hyper again
[02:57:15] <Aria> and I would charge another crystal
[02:57:17] <Aria> and so on and so forth
[02:57:40] <Cetu> Oh gods you sound like Allison
[02:59:08] <Edward> hahaha, how does she sound like Allison
[02:59:19] <Cetu> Crystals
[02:59:33] <Cetu> That's all Allison knows is crystals
[02:59:34] <Edward> Ah
[02:59:52] <Edward> I dunno bro, she makes great crystal umm, ya know things
[02:59:59] <Edward> Crystal sigils or whatever the hell she called those
[03:00:09] <Edward> As long as it works for her, ya nkow
[03:00:21] <Edward> Who are we to critize her spiritual ways
[03:00:23] <Cetu> She's full of lard and failure
[03:00:30] <Cetu> Her bf beats her
[03:00:35] <Edward> Really?
[03:00:37] <Edward> Thats sad...
[03:00:46] <Edward> Maybe I was too harsh on you Aria, and I apologize
[03:00:47] <Cetu> Nah she deserves it
[03:00:56] <Cetu> After what she did on occultus
[03:00:59] <Aria> Edward, I was seriously experiencing a major energy rush
[03:01:03] <Aria> and I agree, Cetu 
[03:01:06] <Edward> I dont think any woman deserves to be beat..... a punch in the face now and then maybe, but....
[03:01:43] <Cetu> Nah she's an asshole with a fat arse
[03:02:00] <Cetu> She's horrible
[03:02:06] <Edward> You know Cetu, I believed her at first because you told me that newf sent you a dick pic
[03:02:10] <Cetu> somehow I made her starve herself
[03:02:15] <Edward> And then you were like, no man, he didnt
[03:02:17] <Edward> And I was like
[03:02:18] <Edward> fuck
