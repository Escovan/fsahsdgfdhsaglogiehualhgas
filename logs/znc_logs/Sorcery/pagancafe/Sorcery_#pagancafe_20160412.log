[23:20:42] <EronGari> I am back in Mexico again, but we are in the process of changing houses. I am shutting down in a little while and probably won't be back on for a few days until we are settled again, next week most likely
[23:21:20] <EronGari> can't say I didn't tell anyone
[23:34:13] <Eugenios> Hey EronGari 
[23:34:30] <EronGari> hey there
[23:34:40] <Eugenios> How are you?
[23:34:51] <EronGari> am packing up to move across town - tired
[23:34:56] * Eugenios nods
[23:35:09] <EronGari> hate moving
[23:35:12] <Eugenios> Understood
[23:35:44] <EronGari> acquire swo much shit that is not apparent until you try to gather it all up and move it
[23:36:51] <EronGari> never any other time is the decision to 'toss it' so easy to make - but even then takes some thought
[23:37:34] <EronGari> athanks for the ping - I needed an excuse to sit down a moment
[23:39:41] <Eugenios> No biggie
[23:39:47] <Eugenios> I've moved several times
[23:39:53] <Eugenios> It can be exhausting, in many ways
[23:40:04] <EronGari> when you have COPD, emphysema, congestive heart failure, over 60, and more...   it is a wonder I am doing anything like this, but exercising and activity is the only way to deal with those and function somewhat normally
[23:40:15] * Eugenios nods
[23:40:42] <EronGari> otherwise it just gets worse
[23:40:59] <EronGari> been there before
[23:41:58] <Eugenios> Understood
[23:42:01] <Eugenios> Do you meditate?
[23:42:32] <EronGari> to an extent - more than most people but less than many pagans claim to
[23:43:33] <EronGari> I use visualizations for much of my 'magical' life to function as it does
[23:45:28] <EronGari> that let me acquire much and experience a lot of neat things, but didn't permit me to abuse my body willy-nilly - but it does give me an avenue to make 'repairs' on it
[23:46:37] <EronGari> well, back tof work
[23:48:44] <Eugenios> ok
