[04:09:25] <Eugenios> Hey Edward 
[04:09:27] <Eugenios> How are you?
[04:09:32] <Edward> Im fine, thanks
[04:09:34] <Edward> Yourself?
[04:09:38] <Eugenios> Not too bad
[04:09:45] <Eugenios> Just tinkering with an occult concept
[04:09:56] <Edward> Yeah?
[04:09:57] <Edward> Do tell?
[04:10:16] <Eugenios> The idea of dice divination that is attributed to astrological symbols
[04:10:33] <Eugenios> I know that there is something called "astro dice", but I wanted to see if I can modify the system
[04:10:48] * Edward nods
[04:10:53] <Eugenios> But unfortunately, it seems like it's another one-shot system
[04:11:02] <Eugenios> Only good for a single answer to a single question
[04:11:13] <Eugenios> Unable to do spreads
[04:12:03] <Eugenios> Like... if I rolled Venus in the 12th house and then Venus in the 9th house, that wouldn't make sense in an actual astrological chart
[04:12:17] <Eugenios> But with dice, number redundancies are possible
[04:14:04] <Eugenios> With Geomancy, there are sixteen figures, unrelated to purely astrological symbolism, but put into a spread with twelve houses
[04:14:17] <Eugenios> With tarot, same thing
[04:14:21] <Eugenios> Or Runes
[04:16:40] <Eugenios> I could simply re-roll if I got the same number, but that seems a bit impractical
[04:19:40] <Eugenios> Any thoughts Edward?
[04:19:53] <Edward> Hmm
[04:20:01] <Edward> Nope
[04:20:03] <Edward> Sorry
[04:21:21] <Eugenios> No biggie

[23:57:13] <Edward> Thanks, yourself>?
[23:57:21] <Eugenios> Yesterday I bought a PDF by a Hermetically inclined Hellenic that I've followed on Wordpress for sometime. He expanded upon the Greek Alphabet Oracle divination system with astrological symbolism (among a few other things). I'm quite impressed with it. After I read the PDF, I perused my main Astrology kindle e-book for more information I could add to the astrologically-infused Greek Alphabet oracle I'm now using, and I have to say, 
[23:57:21] <Eugenios> there is a lot to add.
[23:57:23] <pomm> Hey Eugenios 
[23:57:40] <pomm> Eugenios: got any books on Kemetism?
[23:57:48] <Eugenios> I have two books to recommend
[23:57:58] <pomm> Do tell
[23:58:37] <Eugenios> Temple of The Cosmos for a really solid examination of the historical Kemetic worldview
[23:58:38] <Eugenios> http://www.amazon.com/Temple-Cosmos-Ancient-Egyptian-Experience-ebook/dp/B008COVJ10/
[23:59:33] <Eugenios> And Eternal Egypt for a solid examination on how to reconstruct the rituals
