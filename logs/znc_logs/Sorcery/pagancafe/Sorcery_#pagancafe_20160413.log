[17:48:58] <EronGari> damn, couldn't remember my password right away to sign in on other computer
[17:49:30] <EronGari> for the time being I am connected through the net
[17:49:43] * Eugenios nods
[17:49:58] <EronGari> and at my 'casita' waiting for the other house to be ready
[17:50:51] <EronGari> it is more comfortable for me to be here, but my wife likes me living with her at the main house
[17:51:20] <EronGari> well, a new 'main house' for awhile
[17:52:41] <EronGari> we have another house that I own but is going through legal actions because some clod tried to take it over, and has succeeded for now, but we have the judges' decision it is mine, just have to evict the guy
[17:54:48] <EronGari> my 'house guest' used to own the property the house was built on, used to be a friend, but he got the bright idea he'd try to maneuver his old papers and try to claim the house
[17:57:04] <EronGari> since he was staying there while I built another house he used his 'occupation' of the house to make his claim - it took a long time in court to get the truth out and get the decision, but evicting someone is not easy, especially when his brother-in-law is friends with a local congressman
[17:57:45] <EronGari> so the papers keep getting 'moved' to keep him out of jail and slow down the eviction
[17:58:31] <EronGari> fun stuff
[18:00:08] <EronGari> but, since the house has become a hot issue my wife doesn't want to live there after we get it back, worried about 'retaliations' and what they might pull, so we will just sell it and build or buy another
[18:03:07] <EronGari> my casita is too small to be comfortable for all of us so we have been renting a larger house in another part of town, where my wife has now opened her restaurant and is doing a good business in that location
[18:05:12] <EronGari> the landlord wants to sell that house but we get to keep the restaurant location, we just don't want to buy that house for the price they want - the damn location is hot in demand and over-priced
[18:05:58] <EronGari> but it is a great location for her restaurant
[18:08:58] <EronGari> it is a nice area to live in but the house itself is not all that comfortable and we'd need to do a lot of mods to make it more suitable, but it is a great place within walking distance of almost everything and nice to go out walking around
[18:11:09] <EronGari> but for Mexican 'Futbol' fans my casita and the disputed house are just a couple blocks from the Monarcas Staduim, but been years since I've gone to any of the games
[18:14:01] <EronGari> also a couple blocks from the main transportation 'Central', so we used to take a lot of trips then
[18:14:15] <EronGari> leave the driving to them
[18:16:01] <EronGari> Mexican buses are light-years ahead of Greyhoiund, wi-fi on-board, movies, a snack bag when boarding, twice the leg room of US buses
[18:17:54] <EronGari> Greyhound is not even up to the standard of our '2nd-Class' buses for local runs
[18:48:37] <EronGari> spoke too soon - I checked online and see even Greyhound has wi-fi now
[18:49:41] <EronGari> too bad that doewn't work on planes - have to leve things in 'airplane' mode
[18:49:52] <EronGari> leave*
[19:26:44] <Rajoguna> evictions are always unfun
[19:28:15] <Rajoguna> only a few greyhound buses have wifi
[19:28:18] <Rajoguna> from what i understand
[19:28:33] <Rajoguna> airplanes are too high for wiki i think
[19:28:47] <Rajoguna> cant bounce siginals off of sattalites or something
[19:28:50] <Rajoguna> properly
[19:28:55] <Rajoguna> or maybe im dead wrong i dunno

[19:59:39] <EronGari> Forgot to read my memo to put the UPS box on this computer since I'll be here a few days
[19:59:49] <EronGari> on there now
[20:05:32] <EronGari> got to go to the store
[20:06:35] <EronGari> got to take my dog, just hope he waits patiently and not cause mischief in the back seat
[20:07:23] <EronGari> I'll tip the security guy to talk with him while I'm in the store - he'll do that
[20:07:46] <EronGari> now and then when he can

[21:57:57] <EronGari> and my rib injury that comes back to life now and then is back after the strenuous moving I been doing the past two days - at least it waited for today to start jabbing me now that I have the work done and a couple days to take it easy
[21:58:55] <EronGari> life is just not going to let me take it /that/ easy
[21:59:22] <EronGari> but at least it didn't bother me while doing the tough stuff
[22:01:51] <EronGari> Eugenios, anyone . . .  please, ping my nick so I can see if I have a ping tone on this net connection
[22:02:42] <Eugenios> There
[22:02:46] <Eugenios> Got a pong
[22:03:12] <EronGari> I didn't yet - don't see my nick though
[22:04:06] <EronGari> if it pings for me then I can drift away and be alerted, so can keep connected even over here
[22:05:37] <EronGari> too lazy to reconfigure my X-chat for this - something wrong with how I did it earlier and it refuses connection, so have to use the net for now
[22:06:09] <EronGari> may try it later, but this works good enough
[22:07:47] <EronGari> Pomegranate been around much lately or is she still homeless and not well connected?
[22:08:15] <EronGari> I been away awhile
[22:12:32] <EronGari> Pom ought to be happy Sanders is getting some caucus wins and delegates
[22:12:44] <EronGari> doubt he will knock out the 'Billary' though
[22:13:20] <EronGari> I had to watch some poli shows while visitingin the US last week
[22:13:58] <EronGari> Trump is getting screwed
[22:14:51] <EronGari> that other guy doesn't have a chance of winning if he makes it to the main elections - he'd never make it over the "Hill"
[22:14:56] <EronGari> hillary
[22:15:31] <EronGari> can't even remember hsis name
[22:15:59] <EronGari> sounds hispanic though
[22:16:23] <EronGari> so maybe that would fool some folks in the polling booth
[22:17:36] <EronGari> bbl - need to put on some water for more tea
