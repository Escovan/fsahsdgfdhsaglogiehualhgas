[01:07:55] <Eugenios> Hey VerifiedShitlady 
[01:07:57] <Eugenios> What's up?
[01:10:45] <VerifiedShitlady> Got a book from the library
[01:11:58] <VerifiedShitlady> Kratos The Hellenic Tradition by Gwendolyn Taunton
[01:14:31] <Eugenios> Good find
[01:14:36] <Eugenios> Especially from a Library
[01:15:07] <Eugenios> The best book on the subject is Hellenic Polytheism : Household Worship (Volume 1), hands down
[01:15:26] <Eugenios> It was made by multiple members of the LABRYS group in Greece

[01:19:31] <VerifiedShitlady> I read what I find
[01:19:37] <Eugenios> Understood
[01:20:06] <Eugenios> As far as historical manuals you could find at a library, nothing beats Greek Religion by Walter Burkert 
[01:20:17] <Eugenios> That's invaluable
[01:20:39] <VerifiedShitlady> Duly noted :p
[01:23:31] <VerifiedShitlady> So Greece was the cornerstone of culture and modern intelligence
[01:30:46] <Eugenios> Though I have a very clear bias towards the Greeks, I think it is worth mentioning that "Celto-Germanic" culture also had a very significant role to play in the foundation of modern Western Europe as Greco-Roman culture (and Ancient Near East) did
[01:31:03] <Eugenios> as much as*
[01:33:20] <Eugenios> But as far as disciplines, philosophy, politics, the sciences - the Greeks were invaluable to that formation
[01:39:00] <Eugenios> I think what's so wonderful about the history of Europe, is that we have so many cultures that are apart of our history
[01:39:40] <Eugenios> The Greeks, Romans, Celts, Germans, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Arabians, Babylonians - all of these cultures have influenced us in some way
