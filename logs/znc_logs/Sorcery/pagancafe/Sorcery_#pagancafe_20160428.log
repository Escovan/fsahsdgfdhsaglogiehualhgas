[01:35:43] <EronGari> Edward
[01:35:52] <Edward> Hey EronGari 
[01:35:53] <Edward> Whats up
[01:35:58] <EronGari> how goes it?
[01:36:04] <Edward> It goes well, yourself?
[01:36:16] <EronGari> got my other computer up - on IRC  connect again
[01:36:23] <Edward> Thats good.
[01:36:29] <Edward> I was wondering why you werent in the other channels.
[01:36:34] <Edward> I thought you might have abandoned them.
[01:37:07] <EronGari> the new house we rented is not sufficient - we've decided to do more construction to turn the 'casita' into a casa 
[01:37:22] <Edward> Cool.
[01:37:40] <EronGari> so I am still at the casita but now moving more over here more permanent
[01:37:55] <EronGari> I have so many duplicate 'things'
[01:38:20] <EronGari> my two towers stacked on each other
[01:38:44] <EronGari> maybe having twin monitors is a thing to do
[01:38:58] <EronGari> two 32"s
[01:39:08] <Edward> Nice.
[01:39:14] <Edward> i only have the one pc.
[01:39:15] <EronGari> I need a bigger desk
[01:39:30] <EronGari> I have my laptop too, so 3
[01:39:41] <Edward> I gave my laptop to my mother.
[01:39:52] <EronGari> I gave my android pad to Tere
[01:40:17] <Edward> Had no use for it, aye?
[01:40:28] <EronGari> good, your mom is using computer...    mine too now, she has an Ipad
[01:41:05] <EronGari> a pad can do a single thing pretty well but I really never used it
[01:41:21] <EronGari> should have kept it to use as a preview monitor or some such
[01:41:26] <EronGari> a camera perhaps
[01:41:52] <EronGari> go witha vi
[01:42:00] <EronGari> with a video project
[01:42:37] <EronGari> but, I don't have it anymore
[01:42:48] <EronGari> construction here starts next week
[01:42:49] * Edward shrugs
[01:42:53] <Edward> Cool.
[01:43:36] <EronGari> they will work about a week, then a crew comes in to pour the new "losa" - the flat cement roof
[01:44:12] * Edward nods
[01:44:25] <EronGari> that has to set up for about two weeks, then they take down the supports and clean up - we can finish the switches and fixtures
[01:45:57] <EronGari> so, early-mid June will have three more bedrooms, a suite with baño and a longer parking space inside to accomodate the Kia and Merc
[01:46:22] <EronGari> suite more like a studio apartment
[01:47:04] <Edward> I dont mean to be rude with my question here, as it is off topic, but, are you studied in Kabbalah? 
[01:47:06] <EronGari> that part is mostly built and plumbed, I have the fixtures for that 3rd bath but havent finished the floor so not installed them
[01:47:38] <EronGari> chicken kabbalah
[01:47:47] <Edward> Thats it, aye
[01:48:03] <Edward> Ive been reading this book, its a gnostic christian kabbalah.
[01:48:15] <Edward> And i was comtemplating on the passing through the abyss.
[01:48:17] <EronGari> about it, though I've cracked books about it for decades but not taken much interest beyond the basic s
[01:48:32] <EronGari> the abyss??
[01:48:42] <Edward> If one does this incorrectly, instead of gaining enlightenment, they gain cosmic ignorance.
[01:48:52] <Edward> The Abyss is the Sephirot - Da'at
[01:48:52] <EronGari> break on through to the other side - as in the words of Morrison
[01:49:46] <Edward> well, according to this gnostic philosophy, cosmic ignorance is the spirit of the anit-christ, which is the opposite, obviously, of the spirit of Christ, which one would receive if they cross the Abyss and gain Enligthenment.
[01:49:47] <EronGari> that is always the pitfall of taking up any religious or spiritual involvement - look at all the religious dorks
[01:50:02] <Edward> But, the spirit of the anti-christ has greed, ignorance, lust, all that jazz
[01:50:31] <Edward> And im wondering, if Eso, because he has told me once before that he passed through the abyss, if instead of gaining enligthenment, if he gained ignorance instead, for he is very arrogant.
[01:50:56] <EronGari> well, I can't be sure but it looks like the bad guy got the better presss and the good guy got vilainized in the whole affair
[01:51:32] <EronGari> arrogant about his 'beliefs'
[01:51:45] <Edward> I was talking with someone in private today, who called Newf a bozo.
[01:51:55] <Edward> I dont think they realize how they come off to people sometimes.
[01:52:03] <EronGari> yes, there are many that seem to share that opinion
[01:52:23] <Edward> This person said that Eso and Newf are well read, but they dont know anything about practical magick.
[01:52:26] <Edward> In other words
[01:52:51] <EronGari> dogmatic
[01:53:04] <Edward> And then I think about you, how successful you were in life. And how you got a bum rap over on Occultus because your views about MacDonalds and such.
[01:53:18] <Edward> They were just too ignorance to realize the truth about those statements about sigils
[01:53:43] <EronGari> lol - my off-beat style puts people off
[01:55:16] <Edward> Now, I realize that Hermetic Qabalah would teach that there are no opposites, I think that Eso perhaps views his arrogance in the same way that he views low self esteem, that they are the same thing. But I dont think he realizes that they are both negative, instead of negative and positive balancing out.
[01:55:23] <EronGari> 'magick' works by the person doing it - the practice is just trailway to get there more effectivelu
[01:55:32] <Edward> So ive come to the conclusion that Eso, instead of gaining enlightenment when he supposedly crossed the Abyss, gained ignorance instead.
[01:56:17] <Edward> however, I still need more study.
[01:56:28] <Edward> You got any thoughts or opinions?
[01:56:29] <EronGari> could well be - he can pull a horrendous boner through his good intentions, it seems
[01:56:50] <Edward> Good intentions, pfft
[01:56:54] <Edward> He likes to show off
[01:57:08] <Edward> i asked him once what led him into the occult and his answer was "heresy" 
[01:57:08] <EronGari> you don't believe their little adventure with us was beneficial to them?
[01:57:23] <Edward> And then I realized, he doesnt want to be friends.
[01:57:27] <Edward> He wants to hear himself talk
[01:57:34] <Edward> He wants to jack himself off.
[01:57:49] <Edward> I dont think it was beneficial to anyone except those who will ponder it
[01:58:46] <EronGari> yes, he like that - he used his ego to overcome being a nose-picking nerd kid and transform himself to some swank-ideal, now has to feed an ego to maintain his balloon
[01:59:19] <Edward> And its that ego that has to be destroyed in order to cross through the abyss and gain enlightenment.
[01:59:37] <Edward> Instead, he has gained ignorance
[01:59:57] <EronGari> I think ego is useful, but like chocolate and Big Macs, easy does it
[02:00:14] <Edward> well, when I say death of the ego, i mean the perfecting of the ego.
[02:00:26] <Edward> It is the combining of the gnosis with the conscious-self
[02:00:35] <Edward> As you can tell, hopefully, ive been studying :D
[02:01:03] <EronGari> destroying ego methods always put me off - not without much contemplation of it, decades perhaps, but my opinion is some ego is essential to success
[02:01:32] <Edward> Now when you say ego, do you mean like negative aspects of self?
[02:01:55] <EronGari> maybe I did the ego-death thing chemically, through many acid trips long, long ago in a....
[02:02:17] <Edward> Galaxy, far far away?
[02:02:37] <Edward> I dont want to take drugs because I want to be able to go into these altered states at will.
[02:02:42] <Edward> I think drugs are a short cut method.
[02:02:56] <EronGari> no, as a 'satanist' - or at least from that study - ego is a virtue, but can be poisonous in too large a dose
[02:03:12] * Edward nods
[02:03:15] <EronGari> well, my teens were the 60's
[02:03:25] <Edward> as a Luciferian however, wouldnt one strive for balance?
[02:03:32] <EronGari> yes
[02:03:41] <EronGari> and putting the right foot forward
[02:03:45] * Edward nods
[02:03:55] <EronGari> or lest, if it's the right one for the occassion
[02:04:08] <EronGari> left
[02:04:22] <Edward> I read this book by this Michael Ford dude, it was a Luciferian Kabbalah, basically, what I really liked about it, is that his demons and luciferian angels were the same entity, embodying both darkness and light.
[02:04:54] <EronGari> that is probably closer to the truth - not a black and white world
[02:04:59] <EronGari> living color
[02:05:10] <Edward> Well, as the Kabbalah teaches
[02:05:17] <Edward> The Tree of Life is like
[02:05:20] <Edward> A rainbow
[02:05:30] <EronGari> or at least a fraction of the larger 'truth' to contemplate
[02:05:43] <EronGari> yep, that part wor4ks
[02:05:47] <Edward> Once the light of Ain Soph Aur passes down to Kether, and trinkles down into Malkuth, its a rainbow effect.
[02:06:17] <Edward> Im really glad that I found occultus and went on to study these things, they have opened up my universe quite a bit.
[02:06:47] <EronGari> I guess I like simpler or more familiar names - of couse it evolved, as you may recall, but I got my nose-picking nerdom out of the way through Taz, then Bond
[02:07:01] * Edward nods
[02:07:12] <Edward> Chaos magick, because it became a thing
[02:07:15] <Edward> before*
[02:07:31] <EronGari> I never really heard of that till the 90's though
[02:07:38] <EronGari> I just did it without a name
[02:08:02] <EronGari> then when the name came along I saw it described some of my thechniques
[02:08:19] <Edward> You know, ive learned that the Gods and Goddesses, are forces and ideals that when we commune with them, the ego of the force is formed from our ownself.
[02:08:51] <EronGari> yes, were the children of god, and we're growing up
[02:09:09] <Edward> We are simultaneously the children of God and God him/herself
[02:09:36] <EronGari> some of us reject our parents ways and maybe like some of our neighbors' better
[02:09:56] <EronGari> yes, we have all the attributes, just under-developed
[02:10:11] <Edward> Thats basically what Kabbalah is
[02:10:18] <Edward> Developing a God-consciousness.
[02:10:32] <Edward> In a gnostic christian phrase, becoming Yeshua
[02:10:40] <EronGari> or is it more like Carbon Copy so that we're faded copies - 
[02:10:47] <EronGari> or like an early FAX
[02:10:56] <Edward> as Above, so below
[02:11:10] <Edward> And as it is written in the chicken Qabalah, we are not really life but the image of life
[02:11:15] <Edward> If I remember correctly.
[02:11:21] <EronGari> that is what mysticism is, developing a relationship to the cosmic onsciousness
[02:11:27] <EronGari> consciousness
[02:11:31] * Edward nods
[02:11:58] <EronGari> the principles explained, then the applications
[02:12:06] <EronGari> exercises
[02:12:07] * Edward nods again
[02:12:44] <EronGari> you would take better to the rituals and procedure than myself with AMORC, I am sloppy with it
[02:13:10] <Edward> All in due time.
[02:13:15] <EronGari> the initiations and stuff, along with the weekly study ritual thing, 
[02:13:36] <EronGari> I just do it hap-hazard catch as catch can
[02:13:52] <Edward> As long as its effective
[02:13:54] * Edward shrugs
[02:13:56] <EronGari> but, I done it before, so...
[02:14:21] <EronGari> just a refresher couse right now
[02:14:31] <Edward> How far are you into it?
[02:14:38] <EronGari> but it has been through changes in style and content
[02:14:40] <EronGari> structure
[02:14:52] <Edward> The content is different, aye?
[02:15:06] <EronGari> 3rd Atrium
[02:15:26] <Edward> You know, I bet they let the 1st Atrium leak so that people can have a taste and then if they liked it, they would have to pay for the rest.
[02:15:27] <EronGari> it is similar but some different technique and approaches
[02:15:44] <Edward> Do you prefer one form over the otheR?
[02:15:46] <EronGari> maybe why they are not bothering them
[02:16:01] <EronGari> I incorporate both
[02:16:08] <Edward> Neato
[02:16:19] <EronGari> it just adds dimension to either other
[02:16:30] <Edward> They should have the option to be able to read the older versions
[02:16:49] <EronGari> well, everything is new and improved
[02:17:05] <EronGari> all our stuff in the world - marketing
[02:17:21] <EronGari> but we did get Coke classic back
[02:17:38] <Edward> Coke Classic, magick at its best
[02:17:38] <EronGari> that New Coke thing, might as well drink Pepsi
[02:19:20] <EronGari> I was on a flight after New Coke came out - the flight attendant gave me a Coke and I asked her how they managed to get the good old stuff - she told me I couldn't possibly taste it - then showed me the can - Coke Classic
[02:19:50] <EronGari> someone in Coca-Cola came back to their senses
[02:20:07] <EronGari> or it would have gone the way of Olds and Pontiac
[02:20:07] <Edward> You know, in my studies, ive limited myself to a few areas, the way I was approaching it, was reading a book on this and a book on that.. getting a little bit of info here and there. Instead, im going to focus on Hermetics, Kabbalah, Gnosticism and Christianity and get a good grasp on those before I move onto like say.. Zoroastrianism. 
[02:20:44] <Edward> That person must have been a seer
[02:20:49] <Edward> A coke seer
[02:21:28] <EronGari> all those are good studies - they could all be the right path to a personal paradise - I just like to have my paradise here and not a promise by some celestial developer
[02:22:18] <Edward> Well you know that parable in the bible about the farmer who prays for crops and does nothing and gets another, then the farmer who prays but works as well, gains many fold.
[02:22:35] <EronGari> a cool condo in Heaven - more I thought of it, piped-in harp music 24/7 is not my thing
[02:22:52] <Edward> I think Heaven is subjective
[02:23:15] <EronGari> yes, a carrot on a stick
[02:23:30] * Edward nods
[02:23:41] <EronGari> get it swinging and you can get a bite
[02:24:19] <Edward> That could be a good occult axiom 
[02:24:20] <EronGari> in colorful terms, I said the same thing you did, takes effort too
[02:24:33] <EronGari> lol
[02:24:55] <EronGari> just came to me, that, but it worked - nice inpiration
[02:25:02] <EronGari> make a T-shirt
[02:25:06] <Edward> Heh.
[02:26:08] <EronGari> been smoking like a fiend again, here at my casita, alone with Poog most of the time
[02:26:19] <Edward> Hmm
[02:26:31] <EronGari> breathing well enough but my tastes are still screwed up
[02:26:53] <Edward> My dad is pretty much in the same shape, i guess you could say stable.
[02:26:58] <Edward> Lays in bed alot.
[02:27:22] <EronGari> fruits and gelatins are my main thing to eat, some breads and cheeses, but most complex dishes are inedible, and much meat even
[02:27:43] <Edward> Well that sucks
[02:28:11] <EronGari> figured out my last oubreak of such an attack was 20 years ago - if I can avoid it again for that long, Home Free!
[02:28:29] <Edward> Woo hoo!
[02:28:59] <EronGari> but I feel good enough, just a hoarse voice and some phlegm-cough
[02:29:28] <EronGari> actually, my stamina is short but I can do things
[02:29:53] <Edward> Thats good.
[02:30:36] <EronGari> surgery 20 years ago gave me a new life, qualified for an assignment on the island, light physical duty but high-stress
[02:30:49] <Edward> What kind of surgery?
[02:31:01] <EronGari> long hours
[02:31:04] <EronGari> ovetime
[02:31:34] <EronGari> stomach - it changed my body chemistry
[02:31:39] <Edward> Oh I see.
[02:32:01] <EronGari> made me a super-human, in terms of lab tests
[02:32:14] <Edward> A mutant?
[02:32:18] <Edward> an X-men?
[02:32:19] <EronGari> and I felt like it too
[02:32:49] <EronGari> sort of, with my previous training, I most hit my 'mark' then, in that time
[02:32:54] <EronGari> the past 20 years
[02:34:04] <EronGari> I had a very intersting younger daze as well, but hit my monetary success which brought other opportunities too
[02:34:27] <EronGari> but my performing on stage and other media came before the surgery, and lasted after, 
[02:35:00] <EronGari> it was my way of 'recovering' from that last attack - the surgery was over a year after it
[02:35:17] <Edward> I remember you telling me about being in a mental institute or some such and escaping.
[02:35:19] <EronGari> I needed and ego boost, badly
[02:35:30] <EronGari> that was when I was 18
[02:35:41] <Edward> Why were you there?
[02:35:45] <Edward> What sort of mental stuff?
[02:35:49] <Edward> If you dont mind me asking
[02:36:26] <EronGari> the original Hotel California was around the bend from us, so it was a place to take disorderly, potentially self-destructive miscreants
[02:37:01] <Edward> Oh, so you were just a "bad seed"
[02:37:15] <EronGari> a neighborhood complaint, from these 'girlfriends' parents, a visit by the police, my belligerance
[02:38:09] <EronGari> well, I was not the neighborhood delinquent but I was not seen favorably by any of the more 'proper' set
[02:38:40] <EronGari> different drummer guy, rock guitarist, artist, not a football hero
[02:39:19] * Edward nods
[02:39:46] <EronGari> we were just coming out of the 50's when my school daze began - different world then
[02:40:31] <EronGari> Beatles first appearance in the US on my 11th birthday
[02:40:43] <EronGari> all that started a whirlwind
[02:41:01] <EronGari> within 3 years, pot, acid
[02:41:30] <Edward> Yay!
[02:41:48] <EronGari> the hottest music was breaking out during my Freshman year - '67
[02:42:33] <EronGari> well, the British invasion music was hot for its time, but names you know well were just coming onto the scene 66-67
[02:43:04] <EronGari> and the |British Invasion was its own spectacle and whirlwind
[02:44:03] <EronGari> and of course that 420 magic has its own charm - I was no longer sneaking bnooze and getting drunk
[02:44:23] <Edward> How was acid?
[02:44:30] <Edward> Ive always been curious about it
[02:44:32] <EronGari> I did plenty of hard drinking starting as a pre-teen up to then
[02:44:54] <EronGari> acid is a long trip - lasts hours, can't sleep on it
[02:45:04] <EronGari> trip all night
[02:45:14] <Edward> I read a study about it, where an artist took acid as an experiment.
[02:45:24] <Edward> the results made me, when I was a teenager, want to take acid and do all that arts
[02:45:31] <EronGari> that is when some booze or downers works well, when you need to sleep after it
[02:45:56] <EronGari> well, it is the weirdest trip ever -
[02:46:17] <EronGari> a lot of shit can go wrong - people getting weird ideas in their heads
[02:46:24] <Edward> Bad trips
[02:46:32] <EronGari> but it never let me down - my mind was OK with it
[02:46:45] <EronGari> but I sure saw a lot of stuff go down
[02:46:50] <Edward> Yeah?
[02:47:21] <EronGari> weird thing even happened on their own when I was tripping, sometimes
[02:47:53] <EronGari> not just people flipping out, but real things flipping out, objects
[02:48:04] *** Quits: Sutch (Sutch@the.ebony.tower) (Quit: -)
[02:48:29] <EronGari> and 'hullucinations' and delusion are two different things, but both can happen on it
[02:48:55] <Edward> I just thought id be cool to take some and then make some art
[02:49:06] <EronGari> but what I saw happen to thing, were real
[02:49:20] <Edward> Yeah?
[02:49:22] <EronGari> it might work if you have a knack for art
[02:49:29] <Edward> i do draw
[02:49:37] <Edward> I drew all the time in high school
[02:49:44] <Edward> My art is very abstract
[02:49:47] <EronGari> good, I did some cartooning years ago
[02:50:02] <EronGari> I ddrew cars in school
[02:50:05] <EronGari> drew
[02:50:16] <EronGari> and planes when younger
[02:50:28] <EronGari> I was supposed to be an auto designer
[02:50:35] <Edward> I drew dudes with their mouths sewed shut with a bunch of abstract stuff coming out of their head.
[02:50:50] <EronGari> if I would stay in school, make good grades, get an engineering degree
[02:51:11] <EronGari> but my parents said I was very detached, would make a good doctor
[02:51:51] <EronGari> bah, homework was beyond the 6 hours a day I was less than willing to commit just going to school
[02:52:09] <Edward> I absolutely despised school
[02:52:14] <Edward> It was the most depressing time of my life
[02:52:20] <EronGari> home was not a place for me to spend any time
[02:52:35] <Edward> So far
[02:52:37] <Edward> I should add
[02:52:43] <EronGari> so working there was not on my To Do list
[02:53:15] <EronGari> college for me was good - did that after having dropped out of highschool ten years earlier
[02:53:40] <Edward> Can people still go places these days without finishing high school?
[02:53:48] <EronGari> got an AA degree in Journalism
[02:53:58] <EronGari> I went places
[02:54:47] <EronGari> high school diploma is just a statement that you finished their obstacle course
[02:54:53] <EronGari> finished the race
[02:55:19] <EronGari> but the AA spoke louder, if I didn't mention the other
[02:55:22] <Edward> I didnt really do so well in that race
[02:55:35] <EronGari> community college was really cool
[02:55:41] <EronGari> I'd do it again
[02:55:42] <Edward> I spent most of my time drawing and writing poetry
[02:56:20] <EronGari> yeah, you can tailor your college to make it worthwhile being there
[02:56:28] * Edward nods
[02:56:39] <EronGari> I'd recommend it 
[02:56:53] <Edward> Im not sure the way id tailor my college would ... assist me in getting a job.
[02:56:56] <EronGari> just for a thing to do, so much stuff there
[02:57:07] <Edward> As it would revolve around art and religion
[02:57:27] <EronGari> it might start like that then take off in another direction
[02:58:11] <Edward> True
[02:58:19] <EronGari> I wanted to write, so I did all that first, then to get my degree I had to do the artsy side of it, became a video photographer, and that launched my federal career
[02:59:17] <EronGari> picture worth a thousand words, and I was all written out by then, ready to do it on film and tape
[03:00:19] <EronGari> a little background I already had in electronics, with my photo-journalism, and TV was my entry portal and mainstay throughout
[03:01:50] <EronGari> my trackers on the island had video as well as their more functionally required electronic tracking of distant objects, but the vid was most appreciated when we had fly-by's and close action
[03:03:10] <EronGari> besides for a few years in the photo lab, MoPic/TV Section, I carried my "Official Photographer" on my badge to the last day
[03:03:34] <EronGari> with photo-related assignments the whole time
[03:04:25] <EronGari> so, it opens doors, going to community college, doors you may not know are there right now
[03:04:51] * Edward nods
[03:05:43] <EronGari> only sweet things taste righ to me - today I made whole wheat pancakes for breakfast for the firt time since this - ate them all - 4- without a trouble
[03:06:04] <EronGari> seemed like they'd work
[03:06:30] <EronGari> I manage a few things regular - a ham sandwich the other day
[03:06:53] <EronGari> will have to do that again, just got more ham slices from Sam's
[03:07:03] <Edward> Sam is a good egg
[03:07:26] <EronGari> eggs have been disappointing, except for french toast
[03:08:54] <EronGari> I've eaten more balanced diets before, but this appetite seems out of the norm, but gelatin is a good protein so...
[03:09:31] <EronGari> Poog is really cleaning up on the leftovers
[03:09:36] <Edward> I bet.
[03:09:57] <EronGari> I made a meat loaf a couple days ago, couldn't eat it then
[03:10:04] <Edward> That sucks...
[03:10:07] <Edward> Love meat loaf
[03:10:20] <EronGari> most of it is left and will try it in a sandwich
[03:10:53] <EronGari> a meatloaf/grilled cheese combo sandwich sounds good
[03:11:39] <Edward> Mmm...that does sound good
[03:12:18] <EronGari> day after the meatloaf I made hamburger patties - couldn't eat those either - half of one Poog hasn't finished yet is still down here like a hockey puck waiting for hime - he ate the other half this morning
[03:12:38] <Edward> He must be saving it
[03:13:02] <EronGari> but I give him his favorite, upscale canned or envelop dog food 
[03:13:22] <EronGari> he'll eat it when actually hungry
[03:14:07] *** Joins: whoreface (drinkycrow@sorcery-7k7c12.il.comcast.net)
[03:14:07] <EronGari> saving it, like his dish of dry dog food - he nibbles on it when it's all that is left
[03:14:50] <EronGari> but he is getting the leftovers which at the moment are plentiful
[03:15:23] <Edward> He gunna be a fat little guy?
[03:16:03] <EronGari> Mexico is big on gelatins with rompope poured on it - kind of a cream-wine that looks and tastes like eggnog
[03:16:36] <EronGari> no, Poog is still trim, not the typical pug watermelon-shape body
[03:17:32] <EronGari> he is like the older proto-pugs and not like the ones the breeders turned out
[03:17:43] *** Joins: Eugenios (Eugenios@sorcery-hvemon.ca.charter.com)
[03:17:55] <EronGari> he's like the one in the 1800's paintings and photos
[03:18:02] <Edward> Cool.
[03:19:08] <EronGari> yep, but if the others are like him I undestand why they went that route - they are more docile, he is more like a raccoon/bulldog
[03:20:06] <EronGari> and he definitely wants to be in on any action, even if he has to start it
[03:21:01] <EronGari> the only dog I ever had I have to put on a leash in the back seat of the car when we go placves
[03:21:01] <Edward> A warrior puppies
[03:21:10] <EronGari> he is
[03:21:29] <EronGari> a lot of muscle for a small dog
[03:21:52] <Edward> So precious
[03:21:59] <Edward> My little ones are kinda chubby
[03:22:13] <Edward> Spoiled the crap out of them.
[03:22:13] <EronGari> he won't cry about little things, but he'll whine and bark at me to get attention
[03:22:31] <Edward> Infact I spoiled my big dog so much that he is babified
[03:22:41] <EronGari> I am watching him, but like me he won't gain weight
[03:23:06] <EronGari> he is spoiled, but not over-fed, yet
[03:23:26] <EronGari> I mean, I feed him too much, but he burns it off
[03:23:36] <EronGari> or sleeps it off like now, fortunately
[03:23:44] <Edward> I guess thats the problem with my dogs... they dont really burn it off.
[03:24:36] <EronGari> well, small house, small dog - he can still run, and bothers me with his toys if I am at the computer too long - always wants to play after eating, insists on it
[03:25:42] <EronGari> has several toys and will bring them to me, nudge me with them, bark, insist, I try to take it away from him then throw it for hom
[03:25:51] <EronGari> after a long keep-away session
[03:26:35] <EronGari> a bulldog dowsn't want to let go of things
[03:27:12] <EronGari> he has an underbite so has the attitude of a bulldog
[03:27:33] <EronGari> except most bulls are more docille
[03:29:00] <EronGari> I saw an intersting comedy on YouTube today - Careless - a guy comes home and finds a finger on his kitchen floor
[03:29:27] <EronGari> and later the girl it was attached to
[03:29:41] <Edward> I see.
[03:29:51] <EronGari> seen better movies but it was worth watching
[03:30:16] <EronGari> can make my cult list though
[03:30:44] <EronGari> still want to see Warm Bidies
[03:30:52] <Edward> Warm Bodies?
[03:30:55] <Edward> It was decent
[03:31:10] <EronGari> but seen so many clips I may have seen most of it by now
[03:31:13] <Edward> Good metaphor for how book larnin' can make a people more... evolved
[03:31:23] <EronGari> yeah, a different twist on the zombie thing
[03:31:30] <Edward> I thought it was pretty neat
[03:31:34] <EronGari> and romance
[03:32:31] <EronGari> what is mim's other channel called - I need to put it on my IRC start 
[03:32:41] <EronGari> ?
[03:33:25] <Edward> Well she has two other channels
[03:33:33] <Edward> #practicalmagick
[03:33:34] <EronGari> ok
[03:33:37] <Edward> and #spiritrealms
[03:33:40] <EronGari> and?
[03:33:43] <EronGari> that's it
[03:33:50] <Edward> Yep
[03:33:53] <Edward> Those two up there ^
[03:34:23] <EronGari> ok, had spirtrealms in before but didn't know about practicalmag
[03:34:40] <Edward> Im a mod there as well
[03:34:42] * Edward giggles
[03:35:23] <EronGari> cool 
[03:35:42] <EronGari> I just added it, well SpiritR
[03:35:51] <Edward> Awesome
[03:36:16] <EronGari> may add the other but, later perhaps - not too big of a start menu I want
[03:36:32] * Edward nods
[03:36:49] <Edward> Im on like 11 different channels on this network
[03:36:50] <EronGari> I get a voice somewhere of hers - makes me an elite of sorts
[03:37:25] <Edward> #gaycafe being one of them, im not gay or transgender, but I like the people there
[03:37:46] <EronGari> well, now that I am back on XChat I can add more, it's the net connect that kept me restricted
[03:37:58] <Edward> I sees.
[03:38:03] <EronGari> space-wise
[03:38:06] <Edward> im still using hexchat
[03:38:12] <Edward> On three different networks
[03:38:29] <EronGari> good one - Linux used that later after the version I use
[03:38:34] * Edward nods
[03:38:54] <EronGari> so for now, XChat
[03:39:17] <EronGari> the plug-ins are much interchangeable between those
[03:39:38] <EronGari> for theme and appearance at least
[03:39:51] <Edward> The theme I have is black background with green text
[03:40:10] <Edward> Its alot easier on my eyes, a bright background with dark text really messes me up, makes me feel sick
[03:40:24] <EronGari> had something like that but now just using the standard
[03:41:17] <EronGari> kind of like the florescent lights in school classrooms - sickening 
[03:41:28] <Edward> Yes.
[03:41:39] <Edward> One of the reasons I prefer to read phyiscal books over digital
[03:41:48] <EronGari> been switching my lightbulbs all over to the LEDs
[03:41:48] <Edward> Mostly though because I just enjoy a book in my hands
[03:42:24] <EronGari> I like candle light when I can
[03:42:58] <EronGari> books are good, portable, read many of them
[03:43:22] <EronGari> like them, but at the moment electronic books are easier for me to get
[03:43:29] <EronGari> if I want English
[03:44:04] * Edward nods
[03:44:34] <EronGari> oh-oh, got Poog down at me feet - whew, went outside - got out of bed and came to say hi
[03:45:14] <EronGari> oh, damn, it's dark out now - passed a lot of time here chatting
[03:45:30] <Edward> Yesh
[03:45:49] <EronGari> 15 minutes more and time for me evening meds schedule
[03:46:06] <Edward> fun..
[03:46:22] <EronGari> hit off two inhalers, dry powder type, then a prednisone and a furosimide tablet
[03:46:52] <Edward> Sounds like the good stuff.
[03:47:23] <EronGari> it works, been keeping me on the rebound well enough
[03:47:37] * Edward nods
[03:48:13] <EronGari> got backups for the inhalers, then when those are gone I'll try just the prednisone and furosemide and try to reduce them
[03:48:35] * Edward nods again
[03:49:21] <EronGari> 'specialist' doctors here are too expensive and prescribe the latest pharma-pushed products - the most expensive ones - old school approach is better and cheaper
[03:49:53] * Edward nods again 2
[03:50:06] <EronGari> Tere just messaged me - going to call her - bbiab
[03:51:26] <Edward> Okay, peace

[13:59:53] <Pomegranate> Hello
[14:00:00] <xanzul> hi pom :)
[14:00:08] <Pomegranate> Yo xan
[14:00:10] <xanzul> i was wondering if you were still around :)
[14:00:12] <Pomegranate> How's you?
[14:00:17] <xanzul> im fine :)
[14:00:44] <Pomegranate> Yeah I'm back now. I was busy with moving and whatnot
[14:00:51] <xanzul> been offline most of the past week due to too much walmart and i finally built a desktop :)
[14:01:15] <Pomegranate> Oh nice
[14:01:27] <Pomegranate> I got my own place finally
[14:01:31] <xanzul> nice :)
[14:01:35] <xanzul> have a spare room? :)
[14:01:41] <Pomegranate> haha
[14:01:49] <Pomegranate> Technically yes
[14:01:50] <xanzul> joking mostly :)
[14:01:56] <xanzul> walmart finally made me full time
[14:01:57] <Pomegranate> Because Carter sleeps with me still
[14:02:00] <xanzul> i signed the papers today
[14:02:12] <Pomegranate> since I left the crib hardware at my mom's house
[14:02:16] <Pomegranate> oh cool
[14:02:32] <xanzul> and i also got my evaluation today and they basically told me i was perfect in every regard except for the whole calling out every other day thing :)
[14:02:45] <Pomegranate> Heh
[14:02:53] <Pomegranate> They let you do that??
[14:02:57] <xanzul> not so much :)
[14:03:18] <xanzul> they changed the attendance policy at the start of this month
[14:03:22] <xanzul> an absence is 1 point
[14:03:22] <Pomegranate> Meijer barely let me call off once for a prenatal doctors appointment
[14:03:27] <xanzul> being late is a half point
[14:03:33] <xanzul> and at 9 points you get fired automatically
[14:03:41] <xanzul> im at 7 points :)
[14:04:00] * Pomegranate nods
[14:04:06] <Pomegranate> not good
[14:04:22] <Pomegranate> How much of a grace period for clocking in?
[14:04:28] <xanzul> 9 minutes :)
[14:04:31] <xanzul> used to be 15 :(
[14:04:37] <Pomegranate> Damn
[14:04:42] <Pomegranate> Meijer is 2
[14:05:05] <xanzul> i got fucked today because jackasses didnt want to yield to pedestrians
[14:05:17] <xanzul> so i clocked in 10 minutes after my shift started
[14:05:35] <Pomegranate> No cctv coverage of the parking lot?
[14:05:50] <xanzul> no the issue was before the walmart parking lot :)
[14:05:57] <Pomegranate> Ohhh
[14:05:59] <xanzul> although sometimes that is a bottleneck too
[14:06:14] <Pomegranate> What jerks
[14:06:25] <Pomegranate> Bottleneck?
[14:06:52] <xanzul> the way traffic is set up here it is a clusterfuck :)
[14:07:05] <Pomegranate> Ah
[14:07:25] <xanzul> im just going to start taking taxis from now on
[14:07:28] <Pomegranate> I'm happy I am within walking distance of the grocery store and a dollar store
[14:07:40] <xanzul> at least until i get a cat
[14:07:44] <xanzul> er car
[14:07:45] <xanzul> wtf
[14:07:49] <Pomegranate> I don't even have to cross a street
[14:08:20] <xanzul> my jackass family is moving in jube
[14:08:23] <xanzul> er june
[14:08:35] <Pomegranate> Lol ride a cat to work. Like a twisted version of Sabrina
[14:08:46] <Pomegranate> Moving in? Or out?
[14:08:59] <xanzul> and during my evaluation today i was told they want to train me to be a department manager so that when a dm position opens i can just jump right in
[14:09:13] <Pomegranate> Congrats!
[14:09:22] <Pomegranate> I'm hoping for disability
[14:09:34] <xanzul> and being a dm is a $3-5 raise depending on which departments
[14:09:49] <Pomegranate> fuck work. I have zero motivation and negative 8 energy for a job
[14:09:51] <xanzul> which is basically literally just enough money for me to live on my own
[14:10:25] <Pomegranate> I'd rather be spending time exploring my spiritual side
[14:10:55] <Pomegranate> I have no energy anymore
[14:10:57] <xanzul> also being full time and being an a supervisory position i would be making around 20k a year
[14:11:11] <Pomegranate> zip. Zilch. The big goose egg
[14:11:19] <xanzul> i have no energy either :)
[14:11:23] <Pomegranate> Xanzul
[14:11:29] <xanzul> most days im too tired to drink :)
[14:11:38] <Pomegranate> I have little bumps all over that itch and tingle
[14:11:50] <Pomegranate> The exterminator found nothing
[14:11:52] <Pomegranate> halp
[14:11:59] <xanzul> er
[14:12:01] <xanzul> no clue :)
[14:12:12] <xanzul> maybe a weird skin allergy?
[14:12:22] <Pomegranate> It hurts to walk
[14:12:32] <Pomegranate> Cuz, bottom of feet
[14:12:47] <xanzul> wait the bumps are on your feet?
[14:13:06] <Pomegranate> Feet, hands
[14:13:10] <Pomegranate> Face
[14:13:19] <Pomegranate> The face ones don't itch though
[14:13:20] <xanzul> sounds like hives
[14:13:28] <Pomegranate> tiny bumps
[14:13:33] <Pomegranate> Red
[14:13:46] <Pomegranate> Should I go to the dr?
[14:13:50] <xanzul> and this is why i will never ever work the pharmacy area of walmart :)
[14:14:07] <Pomegranate> Heh
[14:14:15] <xanzul> good way to get sued into oblivion :)
[14:14:26] <Pomegranate> I'LL SUE YOU
[14:14:36] <xanzul> er pom it sounds like an allergic reaction possibly :)
[14:14:47] <Pomegranate> dr?
[14:14:51] <xanzul> also you can get hives from stress as well
[14:15:18] <xanzul> i dont even have health insurance  i know nothing about doctors :)
[14:15:43] <xanzul> last one i saw was before you were born
[14:16:10] <Pomegranate> Wow
[14:16:11] <Pomegranate> Damn
[14:16:32] <Pomegranate> I have a WIC appointment today. Maybe they'll know
[14:16:40] <Pomegranate> Carter has it too
[14:16:47] <Pomegranate> Not as severely
[14:17:28] <Pomegranate> Ima see if my dr will take me today
[14:17:37] <Pomegranate> Gotta call at 10
[14:18:17] <xanzul> oh that reminds me they finally forced me to help out running registers on the front end :)
[14:18:42] <Pomegranate> Cashiering isn't too bad
[14:18:50] <Pomegranate> I'd do it
[14:18:57] <xanzul> i think most of wic is done through ebt now and it is run through as a debit/credit card
[14:19:17] <Pomegranate> WIC has it's own bridge card
[14:19:21] <xanzul> when i was at kmart 15 years ago we had to use wic currency
[14:19:27] <xanzul> it was annoying as fuck
[14:19:43] <Pomegranate> I've always used s card labeled WIC
[14:20:14] <Pomegranate> A card
[14:20:23] <xanzul> also it is nice that people using wic dont have to stick out like a sore thumb when they do their grocery shopping
[14:21:17] <Pomegranate> Right
[14:21:40] <Pomegranate> does walmart indicate what's wic.approved?
[14:21:49] <xanzul> yes
[14:21:55] <Pomegranate> Like how kroger does
[14:21:59] <xanzul> it is part of the info printed on the labels
[14:22:14] <xanzul> at least it should be
[14:22:17] <Pomegranate> Orange sticker that says WIC
[14:22:38] <xanzul> i have seen shelf labes on grocery side that mention wic :)
[14:22:42] <xanzul> er labels
[14:22:49] <xanzul> labes is something else i think
[14:23:15] <Pomegranate> What color at walmart?
[14:23:36] <xanzul> orange :)
[14:23:40] <Pomegranate> Ah
[14:23:50] <Pomegranate> Might be a WIC regulation?
[14:24:24] <xanzul> having that designated as part of the label info yes :)
[14:24:25] <Pomegranate> I have to leave in half an hour. I left my diaper bag at a charity place :(
[14:24:31] <xanzul> ack
[14:24:41] <Pomegranate> Yeah
[14:24:48] <xanzul> oh that reminds me cam is so fucking cute now
[14:24:56] <Pomegranate> Part of my disability is forgetfulness
[14:24:58] <Pomegranate> show pics
[14:25:16] <xanzul> im starting to see why people have kids :)
[14:25:28] <xanzul> just sucks his parents are shitheads
[14:25:37] <Pomegranate> To train to be minions, obviously :p
[14:25:58] <xanzul> whenever i come home from work he starts trying to say my name :)
[14:26:12] <Pomegranate> Awww
[14:26:14] <xanzul> and erika is pissed about it
[14:26:14] <Pomegranate> <3
[14:26:22] <Pomegranate> Hahahhaha good
[14:26:32] <Pomegranate> Let her be triggered
[14:26:51] <xanzul> she is triggered by literally everything
[14:27:07] <xanzul> they spent half the night screaming and slamming doors
[14:27:08] <Pomegranate> Is she tumblr
[14:27:16] <Pomegranate> I mean
[14:27:31] <Pomegranate> I'm fucking borderline and I'm not that bad
[14:28:05] <xanzul> oh that reminds me people told me the assistant manager that was rotated into the area  i work in was supposedly borderline too :)
[14:28:35] <Pomegranate> Nothing wrong with bpd, as long as it's under control
[14:29:04] <xanzul> well she was the one who gave me a perfect evaluation :)
[14:29:26] <xanzul> erika is fucking nuts though
[14:29:48] <Pomegranate> Bordies: we'll either be your best friend or your worst enemy
[14:29:53] <Pomegranate> there is no in between
[14:29:55] <Pomegranate> XD
[14:30:14] <xanzul> she isnt even drinking anymore
[14:30:37] <Pomegranate> that's good
[14:30:48] <Pomegranate> half an hour til I leave
[14:31:01] <Pomegranate> ugh go to my appointment for me, xanzul 
[14:31:13] <xanzul> er im not you though :)
[14:31:39] <Pomegranate> So? Take Carter. It's for him
[14:31:52] <xanzul> and im terrible with kids :)
[14:32:10] <Pomegranate> So am I lol
[14:32:13] <xanzul> which reminds me i hate how parents use walmart associates to teach their kids how to interact with others
[14:32:28] <Pomegranate> What do you mean?
[14:32:52] <xanzul> at least that is what i assume is the reason why parents send their 5 year olds to ask for help
[14:33:05] <xanzul> when i know they are just too fucking lazy to do it themselves
[14:33:13] <Pomegranate> >5
[14:33:30] <Pomegranate> At 5 Carter won't be talking to strangers unless they're cops
[14:33:50] <Pomegranate> STRANGER DANGER
[14:33:58] <xanzul> i almost went off on a woman today
[14:34:05] <Pomegranate> Tell
[14:34:16] <xanzul> i was pulling a cart full of shit thankfully not heavy shit
[14:34:29] <Pomegranate> I should probably put on a bra...
[14:34:30] <xanzul> and i had to stop quickly because she popped up around the corner 
[14:34:47] <xanzul> so i started moving again and she tells ME to stop
[14:34:56] <Pomegranate> I think something other than Carter bit my tit
[14:34:59] <xanzul> rather than her jackass ritalin addled kid
[14:35:26] <xanzul> there is no "stop" when it comes to pulling certain freight
[14:35:53] <xanzul> it is like they dont even understand we are moving literally tons of stuff on an hourly basis
[14:36:14] <Pomegranate> I remember stocking produce
[14:36:21] <Pomegranate> That salad wall though...
[14:36:34] <xanzul> i got stuck in produce for an hour :)
[14:36:49] <Pomegranate> Easy but continuous
[14:36:53] <xanzul> half the department quit and no one wanted to transfer there
[14:37:12] <xanzul> so i spent an hour trying to figure out how the fuck there are 20 kinds of apples
[14:37:12] <Pomegranate> At $1/bag, we ran out within my 8 hour shift
[14:37:47] <Pomegranate> Genetic engineering
[14:38:53] <Pomegranate> What to wear...
[14:38:59] <xanzul> clothes? :)
[14:39:10] <Pomegranate> No
[14:39:15] <Pomegranate> Never
[14:39:20] <Pomegranate> Fur or gtfo
[14:40:01] <xanzul> i kind of want to work at the walmart near virginia tech (which is the area i may have to move with my family to)
[14:40:25] <Pomegranate> I'm within walking distance of the library too
[14:40:29] <Pomegranate> Yayy
[14:40:36] <xanzul> love college guys and there is no shortage of sexually confused hot guys :)
[14:41:10] <Pomegranate> I love nooks
[14:41:14] <Pomegranate> Books too
[14:41:15] <xanzul> nooks?
[14:41:17] <xanzul> oh
[14:41:22] <Pomegranate> Books and nooks
[14:41:29] <xanzul> for a sec i though you were talking about the b&n tablet :)
[14:42:03] <Pomegranate> No as in, little set off areas in a wall
[14:42:15] <Pomegranate> Where one can read forever
[14:42:20] <xanzul> i know:)
[14:42:26] <Pomegranate> NOOKS
[14:42:32] <Pomegranate> BOOK NOOK

[14:42:40] <Pomegranate> My nook has my altar
[14:42:47] <xanzul> i miss my library
[14:42:49] <Pomegranate> :)
[14:42:59] <Pomegranate> I moved counties
[14:43:18] <Pomegranate> I don't miss my old life at all
[14:43:34] <xanzul> well to be fair your mom seemed rather annoying :)

[14:43:44] <Pomegranate> she is
[14:43:54] <xanzul> im very nearly happyish :)
[14:45:40] <Pomegranate> My mom was always criticizing me
