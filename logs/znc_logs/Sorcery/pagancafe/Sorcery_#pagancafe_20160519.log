[15:50:12] <Eugenios> How are you?
[15:51:28] <Cetu> I don't know
[15:51:33] <Cetu> mixed emotions
[15:51:38] <Eugenios> Oh?
[15:52:22] <Cetu> I don't know why but my grandma's death still bothers me
[15:52:35] <Cetu> It was over 4 years ago
[15:54:16] <Cetu> I'm reading a kid's book and it reminds me of her
[15:57:31] <Cetu> And now I'm crying
[16:02:00] <Cetu> Eugenios: what are your thoughts on reincarnation?
[16:16:56] <Eugenios> I think it's one of many possibilities
[16:26:37] <Cetu> I can't stop crying
[16:29:06] <Cetu> I can't read a fucking children's book about Samhain without crying about it
