[14:03:11] <Eugenios> And since February I've been releasing my own music
[14:03:26] <Eugenios> On Bandcamp, and advertising on Soundcloud
[14:05:29] <Cetu> I need to lie about job search
[14:05:43] <Eugenios> Oh?
[14:05:45] <Cetu> what company has a long application?
[14:05:52] <Cetu> Preferably online
[14:06:04] * Eugenios shrugs
[14:07:46] <Cetu> Does parenting my own kid count as childcare experience?
[14:23:40] <Eugenios> I think so, but I'm not sure what employers think
[14:23:56] <Eugenios> Have you ever been apart of the PTA or volunteered at a little league or something?
[14:24:05] <Cetu> Nope
[14:24:22] <Cetu> I once volunteered with special needs children and horses though
[14:28:23] <Cetu> Also my kid is too young for me to be in PTA
[14:32:11] <Eugenios> That's something to put on a resume

[14:57:42] <Eugenios> Speaking of religion, I was able to host my second Hellenic ritual for my local CUUPS organization this last Friday
[14:57:50] <Eugenios> It was very well received
[14:59:46] <Cetu> Sweet!
[14:59:54] <Cetu> How'd you manage to do that?
[15:00:48] <Eugenios> I've been apart of their organization for almost a year now. Since I joined, and traditional polytheistic reconstructionism is a rarity in many Pagan circles, they've invited me to hos
[15:00:58] <Eugenios> They want diversity in their group
[15:03:04] <Cetu> What's CUUPS stand for?
[15:03:16] <Eugenios> Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans
[15:03:25] <Cetu> Ah

[15:04:33] <Cetu> I'm reading The Mammoth Book of Merlin and I'm kinda getting strong feelings about the Arthurian characters

[15:13:04] <Cetu> Since I moved
[15:13:21] <Eugenios> I told her about the nastiness I had to deal with last year in trying to start my own tradition specific group, and she told me that I have something really beautiful to offer people. Coming from a radical eclectic, that means a lot
[15:15:24] <Cetu> She's radically eclectic?
[15:15:59] <Eugenios> Yeah
[15:16:11] <Eugenios> A very eclectic kitchen witch

[16:04:32] <Eugenios> Syncretic is when you practice a path that merges multiple traditions together, while still keeping the original paths. Eclectic is much more open - allowing for less consideration of tradition
[16:04:34] <Cervus-canadensis> I tried to get her to go Celtic, but nooooo

[16:10:50] <Cervus-canadensis> How is your son a demigod?
[16:11:05] <Cetu> Because Pan mothered him

[19:24:35] <Sutch> I am, and don't call me Shirley
[19:24:42] <Edward> hahaha
[19:24:43] <Edward> :D
[19:25:31] <Edward> Im sure Newf might have had an off moment, someone as book larned as him surely wouldnt have confused such a thing.
[19:25:32] * Edward shrugs
[19:25:59] <Edward> Plus he is canadian
[19:26:17] <Cetu> I'm cold
[19:26:26] <Cetu> Idk why
[19:26:26] <Edward> Get a blanket
[19:26:36] <Edward> Cetu, do you know any good books on alchemy
[19:26:43] <Edward> I mean like... I want to read alchemy and stuff
[19:26:45] <Edward> But umm
[19:26:47] <Edward> i know its symbolic
[19:26:50] <Edward> And
[19:26:52] <Edward> Like
[19:26:54] <Cetu> No but The Magicians Companion might :)
[19:26:56] <Edward> I dont want to read about herbs
[19:27:14] <Edward> The Magicians Companion has some passages about Alchemy, but offers no suggested reading.
[19:27:53] <Cetu> Let me dig through my arsenal
[19:27:59] <Edward> Coolio
[19:29:14] <Sutch> how about the anarchists cookbook
[19:29:18] <Sutch> best alchemy 
[19:29:41] <Edward> Lemme check it out
[19:29:54] <Sutch> nah it's not alchemy
[19:30:16] <Sutch> mostly about making crude bombs and anarchist theory
[19:30:17] <Edward> "Perhaps the most notorius How To manual on the market. This is the most asked for book that we know of. Is it any good? Well, it's now in its 29th printing since 1971, has chapters on home preparation of weapons, electronics, drugs, and explosives. Extensively illustrated, 8.5 x 11, 160 pp., softcover."
[19:30:18] <Edward> :/
[19:30:57] <Cetu> KEK
[19:37:56] <Edward> You think newf would know any good alchemical books?
[19:38:09] <Edward> I wonder if he is logged in here under and alias
[19:38:11] <Cetu> Maybe
[19:38:14] <Edward> Newf bro, you here in here? 
[19:38:38] <Edward> Cmon bro, be a good Samaritan and help a brotha out. 
[19:38:46] <Edward> Its your canadian duty
[19:38:56] <Cetu> He's not here
[19:39:00] <Edward> Lies!
