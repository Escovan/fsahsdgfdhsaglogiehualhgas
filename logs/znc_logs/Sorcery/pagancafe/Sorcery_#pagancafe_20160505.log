[16:29:53] <Wolfbane> shes not even attractive
[16:29:55] <Wolfbane> wth
[16:31:46] <VerifiedShitlady> Ha
[16:32:21] <VerifiedShitlady> I got banned too
[16:32:26] <VerifiedShitlady> Because of Allison
[16:33:17] <VerifiedShitlady> She told amira that newf was hitting on her
[16:33:25] <VerifiedShitlady> And sent her pics
[16:33:54] <VerifiedShitlady> And Allison complained that I made her starve herself
[16:34:01] <VerifiedShitlady> good lot that did
[16:34:21] <Wolfbane> ?
[16:34:26] <Wolfbane> VerifiedShitlady: pom?
[16:36:01] <Wolfbane> damn
[16:36:09] <Wolfbane> allison is a bit deceptive
[16:37:52] <VerifiedShitlady> A bit

[16:47:20] <Wolfbane> why the hell does all this bullshit and politics surround pagan traditions
[16:47:34] <Wolfbane> wasn't there shit like alot of sex included in their rituals?
[16:47:34] <VerifiedShitlady> Because humans
[16:47:36] <Wolfbane> makes no sense
[16:47:58] <Wolfbane> btw one big whopper i heard a while back
[16:48:04] <Wolfbane> was that newfy is an ex heroin addict
[16:48:25] <VerifiedShitlady> It was more about fertility of the land
[16:48:25] <VerifiedShitlady> And crops
[16:48:47] <VerifiedShitlady> Wtf
[16:49:54] <Wolfbane> if hes gonna spread it around that im a sleaze bag might aswell let people know that about the guy
[16:50:14] <Wolfbane> not that it worries
[16:50:15] <Wolfbane> me
[16:50:21] <Wolfbane> but hes far from perfect himself
[16:51:00] <VerifiedShitlady> He's a good guy
[16:51:11] <VerifiedShitlady> He's stressed
[16:51:37] <Wolfbane> well then
[16:51:43] <Wolfbane> 3 months ban?
