[01:41:20] <Edward> C.E.T.U.
[01:46:07] <Cetu> I love small tits
[01:46:17] <Edward> Okay
[01:46:19] <Edward> Good to know
[01:48:45] <Cetu> You do too
[01:49:03] <Edward> I love boobies.
[01:49:08] <Edward> Just boobies in general
[01:49:55] <Cetu> I like small ones because I can go braless
[01:50:08] <Edward> I go braless all the time.
[01:51:02] <Cetu> You probably have bigger breasts than me
[01:51:24] <Edward> Well, I wasnt going to say anything.....
[01:51:25] <Cetu> Heck a baby kangaroo has bigger breasts than me
[01:51:25] <Edward> But yes
[01:52:30] <Cetu> I bet if I got fat I'd still have small boobs
[01:54:30] <Edward> Maybe if you are lucky, Cetu, this could be you - https://cdn-img-2.wanelo.com/p/277/cdc/abf/5a0caf08bef5a3fead7c10b/x354-q80.jpg
[01:57:25] <Cetu> An ancient fertility goddess?
[01:57:59] <Edward> With big ol' boobies

[01:59:56] <Edward> You have been and always will be a goddess
[02:00:14] <Cetu> Il y a longtemps...
[02:00:30] <Cetu> Une nouvelle ere

[03:40:16] <Cetu> Google is lame
[03:42:43] <Cetu> Or like
[03:43:00] <Cetu> Even scrying through music
