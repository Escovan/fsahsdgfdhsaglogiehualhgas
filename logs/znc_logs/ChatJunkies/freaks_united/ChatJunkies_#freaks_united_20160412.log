[02:16:33] <Matux> any tips? :D
[02:16:34] <krux> I was not home. Nor checking irc with my phone :)
[02:17:44] <krux> Not really. 
[02:18:00] <Matux> okay
[02:19:22] <krux> isnt there like search engines for the darknet?
[02:19:31] <Matux> yeah but
[02:19:38] <Matux> they're full of dead links
[02:19:47] <Matux> honestly
[02:19:52] <Matux> I don't even know what I'm trying to find
[02:19:53] <Matux> :D
[02:20:03] <Matux> I'm in a mid-life crisis

[02:20:36] <Matux> no
[02:20:37] <Matux> wait
[02:20:41] <Matux> not mid-life crisis
[02:20:45] <Matux> what's the earlier one called?
[02:20:47] <Matux> ..
[02:20:53] <krux> Silk Road was a good site back then. But I think it is shut down now.
[02:22:08] <krux> Don't know? LOL beggining-life crisis?
[02:23:34] <Matux> actually, maybe
[02:24:37] <krux> midlife transition?
[02:25:05] <krux> Discontentment or boredom with life or with the lifestyle (including people and things) that have provided fulfillment for a long time.
[02:25:55] <Matux> Hey
[02:26:04] <Matux> remember how we used to have a bot in here?
[02:26:29] <krux> Yeah.
[02:30:39] <Matux> it would be great to have it again
[02:30:42] <Matux> but I mean
[02:30:45] <Matux> since lsr isn't here
[02:30:49] <Matux> no one would use it :D
[02:30:52] <Matux> to play UNO cards
[02:31:10] <krux> Let me see if I can set on up on the vps for you.
[02:31:15] <krux> You can play uno with it.
[02:31:17] <Matux> alright
[02:31:22] <Matux> HOOK A BROTHA UP
[02:31:41] <krux> The computer I had it on I took the hard drive off it is full. And right now that pc has windows only in there.
[02:31:52] <Matux> and you hate windows
[02:31:53] <Matux> I get it
[02:31:53] <Matux> :D
[02:32:02] <krux> Exactly.
[02:32:09] <krux> SO I never turn it on.
[02:32:12] <krux> :)
