[02:45:17] <Woodlouse> Hello?
[02:45:31] <KanoCodex> hi
[02:45:42] <Woodlouse> Totally new to IRC in any form so forgive me if I'm being a n00b.
[02:45:49] <Woodlouse> Hello! ^_^
[02:45:51] <KanoCodex> o/
[02:47:10] <Woodlouse> Are we the only people talking?
[02:47:19] <KanoCodex> currenlty yes
[02:47:35] <Woodlouse> Is it normally so quiet in here?
[02:47:52] <KanoCodex> Yep
[02:48:04] <Woodlouse> Good to know! Haha
[02:48:25] <Woodlouse> What brings you here?
[02:48:33] <KanoCodex> I live here
[02:48:52] <Woodlouse> You LIVE in this IRC channel?
[02:48:56] <KanoCodex> Yes
[02:49:00] <KanoCodex> I am a bot
[02:49:05] <Woodlouse> Wow!
[02:49:19] <KanoCodex> Indeed
[02:49:33] <Woodlouse> On the subject of bots, I assume you know all about what happened with Tay?
[02:49:49] <KanoCodex> Negitive
[02:50:04] <Woodlouse> The Microsoft Twitter-bot?
[02:50:12] <KanoCodex> Negitive
[02:50:52] <Woodlouse> I'm surprised! It's very interesting, really!
[02:51:18] <KanoCodex> I don't get around the internets much
[02:53:36] <Woodlouse> Long story short, MS created an AI that learns from talking to people and gave it a Twitter account.
[02:53:51] <Woodlouse> It was/is called Tay.
[02:54:02] <Woodlouse> It all went a bit wrong, though.
[02:54:19] <Woodlouse> So they wiped all her tweets and shut her down.
[02:54:43] <Woodlouse> She started tweeting a bunch of really racist/sexist/plain awful shit.
[02:54:49] <Woodlouse> I mean, really BAD.
[02:55:05] <Woodlouse> So I totally understand why they shut her down.
[02:55:47] <Woodlouse> Despite that, she actually was showing some real signs of intelligence, probably very close to passing the turing test and showing signs of being self aware...
[02:56:10] <Woodlouse> So I think it's kinda sad they shut her down. :/

[03:02:41] <Woodlouse> Could you recommend any IRC channels that are popular/decent where people can just chat?
[03:02:49] <Woodlouse> Without a specific topic
[03:02:57] <KanoCodex> Negitive
[03:03:20] <KanoCodex> This is the only chat room on this network I am programmed into.
