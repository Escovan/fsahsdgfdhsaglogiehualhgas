[14:19:39] <Shammah> hi
[14:19:59] <Shammah> Escovan says yes
[14:21:59] <Maketwo> good
[14:22:17] <Shammah> and you'
[14:22:19] <Shammah> you too?
[14:22:24] <Maketwo> I say hello
[14:22:31] <Maketwo> How are you?
[14:22:45] <Shammah> I'm fine
[14:22:47] <Shammah> and you?
[14:22:57] <Maketwo> I'm good too
[14:23:12] <Shammah> what have you eaten'
[14:23:14] <Shammah> ?
[14:23:46] <Maketwo> Anticipation of Tokyo
[14:24:11] <Shammah> sushi
[14:24:57] <Maketwo> Is delicious
[14:25:00] <Maketwo> yum
[14:25:08] <Maketwo> Do you like sushi?
[14:25:09] <Shammah> of course
[14:25:29] <Shammah> sometimes I go in a place where I can eat everything I want
[14:25:37] <Shammah> and I eat almost 70 pieces
[14:25:39] <Maketwo> Spare the cook
[14:25:59] <Maketwo> that's a lot of sushi
[14:26:08] <Shammah> yeah
[14:26:22] <Shammah> once I loved japanese culture
[14:26:29] <Shammah> now I just like sushi
[14:26:38] <Shammah> that's all it lasts
[14:26:40] <Maketwo> what happened to japanese culture?
[14:27:04] <Shammah> in the end was full of bad things
[14:27:43] <Maketwo> oh?
[14:28:21] <Shammah> yes
[14:29:11] <Maketwo> what's the worst?
[14:29:37] <Shammah> the lack of morality, perversion, idolatry... all this stuff
[14:30:46] <Shammah> I saw tons of anime and movies, I read tons of manga, I loved and listened lots of music, but in the end, apart from some poetry, they're obsessed by these things
[14:31:19] <Shammah> when you're inside this culture most of these things sound new, or interesting, or normal, but they are not
[14:51:29] <Shammah> Maketwo?
[15:00:54] <Escovan> Huh?
[15:02:23] <Shammah> Escovan smiles
