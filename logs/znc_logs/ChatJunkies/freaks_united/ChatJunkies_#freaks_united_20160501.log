[20:56:46] <Duce> fucking popers bro
[20:56:58] <Duce> is there like a 420 irc? or some shit
[20:57:11] <Lusi^> erm, what do you mean?
[20:57:25] <Duce> like an irc server where its 420 frendly
[20:58:01] <Lusi^> google is thine friend
[20:58:12] <Duce> doih
[20:58:41] <Lusi^> don't be lazy ;)
[20:59:36] <Lusi^> but no... I'm not sure about cannabis-concerned servers, but you might find channels on many servers I bet
[21:00:01] <Lusi^> there used to be this one drug-related channel on ircnet, called hyperreal, but they moved to another server some years back, so I'm not sure anymore
[21:02:32] <Lusi^> also, if you are to wait for 24 hours and fancy company, you might want to check out the couchsurfing, it's not only for surfing couches, but also for people taking you around, company when you're stuck, etc
[21:02:39] <Lusi^> good thing
[21:03:36] <Lusi^> but if by 420-friendly server you just mean something veeeeeeery sloooooooow, then I just got it..
