[18:48:52] <Lusi^> Matux: so... I'm not into esoteric things then.
[18:48:58] <Lusi^> though I'm openheaded ;)
[18:49:38] <Matux> well, I didn't expect to be accurate :D
[18:49:42] <Matux> but that's almost as good
[18:50:03] <Lusi^> I stopped cutting my hair too ;)
[18:50:14] <Matux> phew, after 4 hours, I've added another 4 and a half pages to my thesis
[18:50:19] <Matux> I'm gettin very close :P
[18:50:46] <Matux> I'mma treat myself a dinner in the pub next to my place :P
[18:51:04] <Matux> and after that
[18:51:11] <Matux> I'll be doing a livestream tonight :) on Twitch
[18:51:17] <Matux> because it's been too long :D
[18:52:05] <Lusi^> alriiight
[18:52:33] <Lusi^> we're going to this guitar concert on suday that's in the local pub
[18:52:51] <Lusi^> 8 quid, but looks worth it
[18:53:40] <Matux> ooo

[18:53:55] <Matux> hehe
[18:54:10] <Matux> I mean, I already have too but
[18:54:31] <Matux> I've been called to do a few songs here and there for some special events
[18:54:45] <Matux> but not exactly just me as an artist in an open crows somewhere
[18:54:48] <Matux> crowd*
[18:54:50] <Matux> that would be awesome
[18:55:20] <Lusi^> cool :)
[18:56:15] <Matux> Here's one I did in the beginning of May, it was a concert by our choir and I did some solo stuff..
[18:56:26] <Matux> but it's in Estonian.. my aunt recorded it with her phone 
[18:56:28] <Matux> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_zE9YcDtUc :D
