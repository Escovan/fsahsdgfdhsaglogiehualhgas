[14:31:14] <Lusi^> we got one of those tvsets with a dvd player inbuilt in the side though :> but it's at my friend's now...
[14:31:56] <Lusi^> the screen however is smaller than my laptop's even :o
[14:32:52] <Lusi^> but yes... I like to nurse my devices from their joining my at any stage of life (new or used) and nurse them til their natural end... sometimes prolong that even ;)
