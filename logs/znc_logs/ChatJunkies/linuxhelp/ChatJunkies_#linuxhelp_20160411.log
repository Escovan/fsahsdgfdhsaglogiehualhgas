[17:38:35] <LionsMane> Ungh, Mondays are so challenging with my depression in swing.
[17:52:51] <AcidJell0> hmm 
[17:52:52] <AcidJell0> yes
[17:52:59] <AcidJell0> the weather has been great for depression
[17:53:05] <AcidJell0> im considering taking a few days off myself
[18:10:24] <LionsMane> Well, I did get in over 200 miles on the  moto this weekend.
[18:10:37] <LionsMane> Got a mild sunburn on my face, which I don't mind.
[18:12:13] <AcidJell0> damn sun 
[18:12:20] <AcidJell0> i havent seen that in ages
[18:12:42] <AcidJell0> our weekend was full of water snow and ass freezing cold
[18:12:52] <AcidJell0> been hovering around 0F
[18:18:56] <LionsMane> Whhaaatt???!!!?!
[18:18:58] <LionsMane> I'd move!
[18:19:02] <LionsMane> heheh just kidding.
[18:19:11] <LionsMane> Even Maine is warmer than that this time of year.
[18:19:24] <LionsMane> It was in the mid 40s both days this weekend.
[18:23:16] <AcidJell0> id move too :)
[18:23:19] <AcidJell0> but family and all
[18:24:17] <AcidJell0> its about 4C now
[18:54:54] <LionsMane> Yeah it was 4~6C this weekend.
[18:55:26] <LionsMane> Cool riding weather.  My sweet spot is about 12C.  AT that temp, I can ride for hours and hours.
[19:16:39] <AcidJell0> hmm
[19:16:47] <AcidJell0> id say maybe 20C for me
[19:29:48] <LionsMane> Well, I lived in Maine.  If I waited for temps to get to 20C, I'd be able to ride for about five months out of the year.
[19:30:16] <LionsMane> The Boston winter this year, I could have ridden all damn winter.  I resent having put up my moto for the winter.
[19:31:08] <LionsMane> The good part is that in eastern Mass, they mostly use salt, which washes away quickly.  In central and western mass, they use salt-sand and sand-only for the roads.
[19:31:27] <LionsMane> This makes corners a bit dodgey.
[19:41:35] <AcidJell0> oh yah
[19:41:40] <AcidJell0> i remember that during spring
[19:41:56] <AcidJell0> you get that mix of salt and sand from the snow 
[19:42:56] <synic> Here is gets so hot that all the tar they use to fix the roads gets all mushy.  It feels super wonky on a bike
[19:43:28] <synic> so it's almost like I can't ride in the winter or in the middle of the summer
[19:43:45] <AcidJell0> i thought they like to use concrete in super hot areas
[19:43:51] <AcidJell0> concrete is nice to ride and or drive on
[19:44:24] <synic> Nah, any time there is a crack or anything in the pavement, they fill it with this tar like substance
[19:44:30] <synic> which is fine most of the time
[19:44:52] <synic> but when it's 41C out, nope.
[19:45:33] <synic> People still ride.  Maybe I'm just a pansy
[19:49:18] <AcidJell0> i used to stop by the side of the road and clutch the exhaust pipe for heat
[19:49:36] <AcidJell0> thats when i used to do 20k a summer

[19:59:13] <grape> hi all
[19:59:16] <grape> hi LionsMane 
[19:59:29] <grape> LionsMane: how was your jabba-jabba-brum-brum at the weekend? :-)
[20:01:22] <AcidJell0> hi grape 
[20:02:15] <grape> hi AcidJell0 
[20:02:39] <grape> right... time to get some food
[20:02:39] <grape> bbl
[20:15:54] <LionsMane> grape: There was a good deal of jabba-jabba-brum-brum. 
[20:16:21] <LionsMane> That being said, the sounds you are thinking of is like a harley.  I ride a BMW, it is more of a purr
[20:16:32] <LionsMane> Well, unless I really open it up.
[20:16:49] <AcidJell0> i see
[20:16:53] <LionsMane> Man, I seriously leaned into the throttle this weekend coming out of the toll booths.
[20:17:05] <LionsMane> I got a little slippage on the back tire.
[20:17:21] <AcidJell0> i could nevver understand how you sit around on those boxer engines
[20:17:21] <LionsMane> That F class motor has got some torque.
[20:18:09] <LionsMane> AcidJell0: Don't say to a harley rider, but that is how you find out what it is like to be a girl or a boy bottom.
[20:18:10] <LionsMane> :D
[21:02:43] <LionsMane> (hint: you have to spread your legs a bit to wrap around the engine.)
[21:02:51] <LionsMane> Makes me happy to be riding my GS.
[21:03:12] <LionsMane> Speaking of which, I need to find the operator's manual for my moto.
[21:16:19] <grape> hi LionsMane 
[21:16:47] <grape> LionsMane: so you were riding a cat? :D
[21:16:54] <grape> or was it a tiger?
[21:18:20] <grape> LionsMane: is there not a lady's way of sitting.. similar to the horses.. which does not involve spreading your legs (which is frowned upon in the tube by the way)?
[21:37:30] <LionsMane> Well, Not really.  There is the shifter on one side and the brake on the other
[22:00:30] <grape> I break for nobody!
[22:00:31] <grape> :D
[22:01:28] <AcidJell0> not even walls ?
[22:01:47] <grape> AcidJell0: where there is a wall there is a tunnel!
[22:01:48] <grape> :D
[22:14:20] <grape> bbl
[23:33:31] <LionsMane> hahahaha
[23:33:54] <LionsMane> That is one way to look at it, grape.  Amazing to me that you are still alive, but hey, yanno.
[23:34:34] <AcidJell0> lol
[23:34:54] <AcidJell0> maybe he doesnt practice what he preaches
[23:41:29] <grape> back
[23:41:52] <grape> LionsMane: I think I have told you before: I am dead yet!
[23:41:54] <grape> or so
[23:42:14] <LionsMane> yes
[23:42:30] <LionsMane> I get that.  You seem to be doing a smash up job so far.
[23:43:02] * LionsMane munches on his Poptart, wishing for the sweet release of death.
[23:43:20] <grape> no... you cannot wish for that LionsMane ... sorry :-)
[23:43:34] <grape> but yes... I got a smashed job... I got a new line manager now
[23:47:12] <LionsMane> Oh curious!!!  Do tell!!!
[23:47:54] <grape> tomorrow... it is late... and you are off soon...
[23:48:31] <AcidJell0> what does a smashed job mean ?
[23:48:35] <AcidJell0> is that like a good thing ?
[23:51:05] <grape> AcidJell0: I got no idea
