[16:39:38] <LionsMane> meh.  Yet another weekday.
[16:39:53] <LionsMane> I guess another opportunity to not be a waste of human effort.
[18:31:23] <AcidJell0> hey LionsMane 
[18:32:20] <AcidJell0> yep another day
[18:54:05] <AcidJell0> fuck im getting pissed with windows lately
[18:54:21] <AcidJell0> i picked a perfect time to get back to linux for desktop
[18:54:29] <AcidJell0> managed to disable network manager yesterday
[18:55:58] <AcidJell0> getting closer
[19:13:05] <LionsMane> AcidJell0: Nice.
[19:13:17] <LionsMane> I just got out of one meeting and I am off to another in a moment.
[19:13:19] <LionsMane> Meh.
[19:38:25] <AcidJell0> well at least you have human interaction
[19:38:37] <AcidJell0> im noticing im talking to myself more and more often
[19:38:54] <AcidJell0> and im noticing it less and less when im in public ...
[20:10:26] <LionsMane> Yup, I hear that.
[20:10:45] <LionsMane> I have found that it is unwell for me to spend too much time alone withmyself.
[20:11:05] <AcidJell0> its unwell for everybody
[20:11:12] <LionsMane> I worked at home yesterday and I found my craving to bugger my fellow subway riders.
[20:11:17] <AcidJell0> theres scientific evidence that shows social people live longer
[20:11:26] <LionsMane> I don't know why the older I get the more cranky I get when I work alone.
[20:12:07] <LionsMane> Well, I am a social person.  I am an outstanding extrovert.  I get energized when I am around people.  And the charge is even better when I am around other extroverts.
[20:13:06] <LionsMane> I went to a benefit last weekend, there was a strawberry blonde cutie there.  I chatted her up a bit at the event, and we connected on FB.  She is a total pistol.  Maybe she'll help me get out of this funk I am in.
[20:13:54] <AcidJell0> i used to be quite the extrovert
[20:14:01] <AcidJell0> then i arrived on these shores and things changed
[20:14:43] <AcidJell0> its funny that ive lived in north america for 21 years now
[20:14:51] <AcidJell0> and i still find it to be difficult
[20:15:00] <AcidJell0> i mean unusual from how people are back home
[20:15:04] <AcidJell0> more accepting
[20:15:16] <AcidJell0> then i started to work in the US and its waay better then in canada
[20:15:54] <AcidJell0> here in canada is weird to just talk to people on the street and ive done it a few times most of the time people will try to run away from a conversation
[20:18:31] <AcidJell0> worst is the wife
[20:18:51] <AcidJell0> she makes anyone that she doesnt agree with super uncomfortable
[20:19:06] <AcidJell0> not to mention even the people she does like never ever invites over
[20:19:34] <AcidJell0> i guess shes super self conscious about our house

[21:10:53] <LionsMane> Sounds like your wife might have some socialization issues.
[21:11:30] <LionsMane> From your side of the story, she does sound like she has some impulse control and possibly abuse tendancies.
[21:11:52] <AcidJell0> s/socialization//
[21:11:59] <AcidJell0> yah she does
[21:12:13] <AcidJell0> oh man abuse allright, its funny tho
[21:12:26] <AcidJell0> definition of abuse is only when you swear or hit something/somebody
[21:12:38] <AcidJell0> verbal and mental abuse is not in that def.
[21:13:06] <AcidJell0> thats probably the most difficult part of this problem, solving the financial problem
[21:13:22] <AcidJell0> i cant figure out what the best way to get out without financially fucking myself
[21:53:10] <LionsMane> Whose definition are you using for "abuse"?  Are you talking about legal term or the psychological term?
[21:58:39] <AcidJell0> hmm
[21:58:50] <AcidJell0> i just mean there are different types of abuse
[21:58:58] <AcidJell0> general accepted one is physical
[22:02:43] <LionsMane> Again, what is the context?  Legally speaking, "saying bad words" is not considered assault unless it includes some sort of threat of physical harm.
[22:03:20] <LionsMane> Butâ€¦ there is mental abuse and emotional abuse.  There are many hotlines to help folks deal with the "non hitting variations of abuse"

[23:31:20] <lowkey> hi all
[23:31:23] <lowkey> hi grape
[23:39:41] <grape> hi lowkey 
[23:39:43] <grape> how are you?
[23:41:10] <lowkey> alright,  just fighting with vim configs.  
[23:41:17] <lowkey> and how are you doing?
[23:41:53] <grape> not too bad....
[23:42:04] <grape> I done some painting in my workshop... my garden chairs...
[23:42:23] <lowkey> getting ready for summer.  thats always a good plan
[23:42:35] <grape> yep
[23:44:06] <grape> that is the plan
[23:44:21] <grape> the seats are done now... I only need to do the three backrests
[23:44:48] <lowkey> its getting warm here.  i took a walk today (had to go to dentist) and it was warm enough to get sweaty in jeans
[23:45:11] <grape> well it is warm here as well.. but still cold in the morning
[23:45:13] <lowkey> so its time for shorts!
[23:45:32] <lowkey> its cool in the morning but by 9 or 10 its getting hot
[23:46:16] <grape> it is a bit colder here... and I cycle...
[23:46:43] <lowkey> you're a bit further north than me. 
[23:47:47] <lowkey> plus I live in a semi-arid climate.  once the rains of spring are over it just gets hot
[23:48:01] <lowkey> of course we may get snow this weekend yet
[23:48:25] <grape> they were saying something about frost in the morning as well
[23:48:55] <lowkey> so just cycle faster!  get those legs pumping and you'll warm right up.
[23:48:58] <lowkey> :-P
[23:49:45] <grape> no... I only ride for around 8 mins.. if
[23:49:52] <grape> so I don't really warm up
[23:50:31] <lowkey> ok so plan a wont work
[23:51:03] <grape> yes
[23:51:32] <lowkey> thats why we always have plan b.  the problem is we only have one plan b for any contingency and I'm not sure how thermonuclear weapons help in this situation.
[23:52:00] <grape> well.. you get hot... very quickly
[23:52:14] <lowkey> it might offend some of your fellow commuters
[23:52:32] <lowkey> ok, so it solves the temp problem.
[23:52:50] <grape> you cannot have the cake *and* own it!
[23:52:57] <grape> erm
[23:53:02] <grape> you cannot eat the cake *and* own it!
[23:53:12] <lowkey> lol
[23:53:29] <grape> wrong way around the first time... 
[23:53:30] <grape> bummer
[23:54:09] <lowkey> its always better when you eat someone elses cake.  especially when you're not caught.
[23:54:35] <grape> that is the plan
[23:55:38] <lowkey> see the trailer for the new star wars rogue one movie?
[23:55:58] <lowkey> that looks good
[23:56:09] <grape> no.. not yet

[23:58:24] <lowkey> "This is a rebellion isn't it?   I rebel"
[23:59:25] <grape> erm... somehow I get: an error has occured...
[23:59:32] <grape> maybe because I come by way of Tor
