[00:29:11] <grape> hi lowkey 
[00:29:32] <lowkey> hey grape
[00:29:37] <grape> how are you?
[00:30:46] <lowkey> fairly good, just losing my mind a little
[00:30:54] <lowkey> and you?
[00:31:23] <lowkey> OK. Amarok is going to piss me off.
[00:31:47] <lowkey> it crashes and holds the sound channel locked.  so no new session can get sound.
[00:32:00] <lowkey> update this m-fer!
[00:34:19] <grape> you are lucky it is only the sound which is blocked... in my case it was the gpu
[00:35:27] <lowkey> I'm so tired of sound issues that I'm ready to buy a new system
[00:35:47] <lowkey> you'd think they would have worked out the issues with a 10yr old sound card
[00:36:24] <grape> I guess that is the problem: too old
[00:36:52] <lowkey> it might be.
[00:37:02] <lowkey> but its a generic Intel sound chip.
[00:38:18] <grape> ok
[00:38:23] <grape> have a look at that:

[00:38:39] <grape> and I got that a zillion times
[00:38:51] <lowkey> that doesnt seem happy
[00:39:54] <grape> nope
[00:39:59] <grape> I had to reboot the machine
[00:40:14] <lowkey> I just hate having to reboot my system for ...sound.
[00:40:27] <lowkey> I can restart everything else without a reboot 
[00:40:39] <lowkey> but not sound.  its like windows.  
[00:41:23] <grape> have you tried to unload the module?
[00:42:29] <lowkey> to make that impossible, the module loads about 20 sub-modules
[00:42:52] <lowkey> so you can't rmmod it without working your way through them and all their dependencies
[00:44:27] <lowkey> this is what makes me want to just use my laptop 100% of the time.
[00:44:33] <lowkey> stuff on it just works
[00:44:49] <lowkey> but a desktop thats way to complicated.
[00:45:26] <lowkey> although I should probably dump amarok. I dont use KDE and that might be part of the issues....
[00:47:36] <grape> I am still using xmms for my mp3
[00:48:48] <lowkey> I probably should
[00:49:02] <lowkey> either that or xmms2
[00:49:14] <grape> there is a new one out? I did not know that
[00:49:29] <lowkey> its more server based.
[00:49:58] <grape> ok
[00:50:02] <lowkey> very handy to run the sound out a remote system and control it from your desktop
[00:50:09] <grape> right... don't get me wrong... but time to go to bed... 
[00:50:11] <lowkey> or allow multiple users to control it
[00:50:16] <lowkey> thats cool
[00:50:29] <lowkey> i should probably reboot to see if that fixes it anyway
[00:50:33] <grape> it has been a busy day today...
[00:50:48] <lowkey> thats no good.  its only monday
[00:51:14] <grape> true
[00:51:33] <grape> one quick Q: what are web sockets?
[00:52:15] <lowkey> good question.  my basic understanding is web sockets are services that you connect to over http or https wrappings.
[00:52:21] <lowkey> but I could be wrong
[00:53:54] <lowkey> ok pavucontrol to the rescue!
[00:54:09] <lowkey> damn system set itself to off.
[00:54:15] <grape> ok
[00:54:23] <grape> I will tell you tomorrow about it...
[00:54:26] <grape> bedtime here...
[00:54:31] <grape> ttfn
[00:54:37] <lowkey> ok, sleep well!
[00:54:37] <grape> and good luck with your sound problem
[00:54:39] <grape> thanks
[00:54:41] <grape> you too

[21:28:57] <AcidJell0> that sounds like some interesting food
[22:03:38] <AcidJell0> ok
[22:03:49] <AcidJell0> google clarified that term for me ... didnt even know it was a bloody word
[22:16:47] <LionsMane> hahaha
[22:17:03] <LionsMane> There is much goodness to be fonud in the big wide world web.
[22:17:19] <LionsMane> It is a nearly obsolete word, tho.

[23:07:08] <LionsMane> Howdy lowkey
[23:07:36] <LionsMane> grape: Basically, vittles are another word for food, like what you'd cook when camping.
[23:07:43] <lowkey> see that a British company claims to have invented the Babelfish?  (well for 4 languages)

[23:10:06] <grape> hi lowkey #
[23:10:17] <grape> lowkey: you remember the memory error I posted a few days ago?
[23:10:30] <lowkey> yeah the GPU one?
[23:10:45] <grape> well... one of my calculations crashed... so I was running memtester...
[23:11:02] <lowkey> bad stick of ram?
[23:11:21] <grape> FAILURE: possible bad address line at offset 0x1a083fb8
[23:11:26] <grape> looks like it...
[23:12:00] <lowkey> well, on the plus side its easier to replace RAM than video chips
[23:12:03] <grape> but at random bits
[23:12:15] <grape> well.. I put in my old nVidia card ;-)
[23:12:55] <lowkey> its always good when you have a spare handy
[23:13:35] <grape> true...
[23:13:49] <grape> when I selected the motherboard I made sure I got a slot for a video card
[23:13:58] <grape> LionsMane: thanks for the explaination.. so you been camping?
[23:14:51] <LionsMane> Quite a bit when I used to live in Maine.
[23:15:02] <grape> ok
[23:15:33] <LionsMane> It is not hard to find a spot without electricityâ€¦ but finding camping without running water, now there is a whole mess of Maine that fits that category that is just amazing.
[23:16:03] <lowkey> east coast camping is like camping for beginners
[23:17:09] <grape> never been camping
[23:18:35] <lowkey> I used to be big on it but the last few years I seldom go further than the WIFI will reach
[23:20:05] <LionsMane> how so, lowkey?
[23:20:22] <LionsMane> How is camping in Maine like camping for beginners?
[23:21:02] <lowkey> real hard core camping is desert camping.  Where you hike in 1 gallon of water (8lbs) for every day out.
[23:21:53] <lowkey> if a car is involved, its beginner level.   its fun but its not hard core.
[23:25:09] <lowkey> and for the record, the Appalacian trail is not beginner camping.  thats as close as you can get to hard core without being in the desert
[23:29:46] <LionsMane> Fair enough.
[23:29:57] <LionsMane> Yeah, I don't want to work that hard for my vacation.
[23:30:50] <lowkey> there are some old native sites in southern Utah that are worth the hike in, but it takes some time
[23:32:42] <AcidJell0> shit
[23:32:54] <AcidJell0> found some old old friends from grade school
[23:33:05] <AcidJell0> talked four about an hour ... now i gotta get off work
[23:33:08] <lowkey> that happens in prison
[23:36:08] <lowkey> anybody running fwsnort?
[23:39:37] <lowkey> fark:  Some people die alone. Some people die after banging their heads on the wall while having 'vigorous sex' with a transsexual prostitute in Thailand. Only one will win you posthumous glory around here

[23:50:28] <lowkey> well he is a candidate for election.
[23:52:29] <LionsMane> I guess I don't know the staffing service.
[23:53:56] <lowkey> never heard of them either.  apparently he shared the screenshot as proof for some conspiracy theory
[23:56:51] <lowkey> GOODYEAR, AZ (KPHO/KTVK) -
[23:56:53] <lowkey> Goodyear police say a father of four admitted to sacrificing the family dog because he didn't agree with his 17-year-old daughter's T-shirt.
[23:57:13] <grape> ??
[23:57:18] <grape> are people mad these days?
[23:58:13] <lowkey> http://www.azfamily.com/story/31984967/father-upset-with-daughters-t-shirt-sacrifices-family-dog-in-smoker
[23:58:37] <lowkey> full bat shit insane....or on drugs.  I can't tell which
[23:59:19] <lowkey> yep.  he smoked marijuana earlier in the day.
[23:59:24] <lowkey> its the drugs
[23:59:51] <lowkey> The court paperwork adds that Thompson stated his readings in the Bible required a male sacrifice in this situation and that it wasn't going to be him or his firstborn son. So, the paperwork says, he chose the family dog.
