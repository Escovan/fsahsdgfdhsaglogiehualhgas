[00:25:08] <grape> hi lowkey 
[00:25:12] <grape> how are you?
[00:25:26] <lowkey> good.  it is a good day.
[00:25:56] <grape> good to hear
[00:26:02] <lowkey> I just added more RAM to my laptop than what seemed unbelievable a few years ago
[00:26:11] <lowkey> +8GB
[00:27:14] <lowkey> with a total of 12GB, my laptop now has the most RAM of any system I have
[00:27:15] <grape> I remember a time when a hard drive of 1 GB was considered to be *BIG*
[00:27:22] <grape> that is impressive
[00:27:44] <lowkey> I still own our old IBM PC-XT which had 640K of RAM
[00:27:51] <grape> I only got 6GB on my desktop at work
[00:28:48] <lowkey> well the laptop had 6GB (but I had to take out a 2GB stick)
[00:29:04] <lowkey> but Qubes ran into a few issues if I ran too many VMs
[00:29:35] <lowkey> this should give me enough room to play around
[00:30:18] <lowkey> tempted to get another 8GB stick and see if I can replace the 4GB it has.
[00:30:35] <lowkey> so then I will have 16G instead of 8G
[00:31:01] <lowkey> not sure I need it but it would be cool
[00:31:29] <grape> does your mother board support that much RAM?
[00:31:55] <lowkey> according to ASUS the limit is 8GB total.  so I'm already above what they certify
[00:32:23] <grape> and Linux does see all the RAM? same goes for the BIOS?
[00:32:36] <lowkey> yep
[00:32:42] <lowkey> and XEN sees it all
[00:33:38] <grape> good
[00:35:22] <lowkey> have to do some testing to verify that its still stable with the extra ram
[00:35:30] <lowkey> but so far so good...
[00:35:45] <grape> sounds good...
[00:36:41] <grape> right... don't get me wrong but it is late here and tomorrow will be another long day... so I better get my beauty sleep
[00:37:03] <lowkey> sleep well grape!
[00:37:03] <lowkey> I've got testing to do!
[00:37:06] <lowkey> :-)
[00:37:43] <grape> good luck... and I will learn tomorrow about testing :-)
[00:37:44] <grape> ttfn
[00:38:07] <lowkey> g'nite :-)
[00:39:13] <grape> :-)
