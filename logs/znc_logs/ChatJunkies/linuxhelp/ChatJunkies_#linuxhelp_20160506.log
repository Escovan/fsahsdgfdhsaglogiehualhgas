[16:19:33] <AcidJell0> guten morgen
[16:38:02] <LionsMane> MMM  yeastie!
[16:38:15] <LionsMane> oh wait, not gLuten.  
[16:38:18] <LionsMane> Got it!
[16:38:30] <LionsMane> You are talkin' that forgienese 
[17:17:01] <AcidJell0> gluten is good
[17:17:17] <AcidJell0> its like the staple of chinese food
[17:27:20] <LionsMane> Really?
[17:27:31] <LionsMane> Rice is a big part of their diet.
[17:27:44] <LionsMane> And to a much lesser degree corn starch.
[17:28:07] <LionsMane> I know there are some things made from wheat and stuch.
[17:28:36] <AcidJell0> much like corn starch theres MSG right ... monosodium gluten :D
[17:30:26] <AcidJell0> then i think they use gluten too
[17:30:40] <AcidJell0> like stuff made out of wheat gluten ... like that fake meat stuff
[17:30:48] <AcidJell0> or maybe indians eat more of it
[17:42:37] <LionsMane> Ah MSG is an American additive to Chinese cooking.  That is Americanized Chinese.
[17:42:54] <LionsMane> It is like having McDonalds in India.  It is not the same.
[17:46:47] <AcidJell0> you know
[17:46:51] <AcidJell0> i keep hearing this
[17:47:02] <AcidJell0> ive not been convinced that is the case
[17:47:12] <AcidJell0> i have not been to china
[17:47:23] <AcidJell0> but ive been to some reaaally chinesy restaurants
[17:47:36] <AcidJell0> and there is no major difference in their food that i can see
[17:48:07] <AcidJell0> unless by chinese food were talking about live baby rats ... or cat / dog live fried fish stuff
[17:48:15] <AcidJell0> but even that crap gets msg'd
[18:04:53] <LionsMane> yeah, I would suggest digging deep into a Chinatown in a large city.
[18:05:11] <LionsMane> There are parts of NYC's Chinatown that are pretty sketchy.
[18:05:24] <LionsMane> I haven't been to Toronto's Chinatown.
[18:12:00] <LionsMane> You are pretty close to Montreal, too.  I haven't been, so I have no idea if they even have a Chinatown.
[18:13:45] <AcidJell0> i work with a few chinese guys
[18:14:03] <AcidJell0> one is chinese chinese as in still a chinese citizen or whatever
[18:14:28] <AcidJell0> his wife's from shanghai and hes from ... i forget
[18:14:35] <AcidJell0> kawloon
[18:14:55] <AcidJell0> ive been to tons of chinese places with them and they say yes this is authentic chinese food
[18:16:06] <AcidJell0> would you be pissed if at your work place youd constantly be passed on lead positions ?
[18:17:57] <LionsMane> huh, go figger about the food.  I guess there is a difference between Chinese cooking from a restaurant vs home style Chinese.  I consider homestyle to be what I would find people cooking at home.
[18:18:26] <LionsMane> Consider how much stuff goes into restaurant food vs the stuff you cook at home.   There is quite a gulf there, too.
[18:18:58] <LionsMane> As for getting passed over for lead positions: have a one on one with your direct report.  If you don't like the answer go to his direct report.
[18:19:12] <LionsMane> It'll stir things up, and get you some visibility.
[18:19:19] <AcidJell0> i mean i use MSG at home
[18:19:34] <AcidJell0> i did for a while ... unintentionally
[18:19:47] <LionsMane> Maybe either one might give you some groooming tips to be project lead material.
[18:20:01] <LionsMane> I don't use MSG at home.  Don't think I have ever bought it.
[18:20:11] <AcidJell0> then i realized it and started cooking with the non msg version and i gotta say i dont like it :)
[18:20:28] <AcidJell0> LionsMane, thats what i was hoping for
[18:20:59] <AcidJell0> im just sort of scared that im stuck in a "all is good" type of company
[18:23:03] <LionsMane> Well, it is a steady paycheck.  But I hear your interest in wanting to move forward.
[18:23:32] <LionsMane> So that is my advice.  I am banging on my chain of command about troubles  I am having with my peer groups.
[18:24:06] <LionsMane> I have clearly stated to them that there are issues and they must have resolution for us to have a go forward plan.
[18:27:32] <AcidJell0> i really just want to know their honest opinion, id like to hear something like ... well you just are not ready for it and that would def. make me feel better
[18:27:44] <AcidJell0> your situation sounds a lot more complicated
[18:29:52] <LionsMane> Well, maybe my situation is complicated.  You situation could be complicated by "I just want to tell you what you want to hear" feedback from your boss and his boss.
[18:30:38] <LionsMane> If they just tell you something to make you feel good, neither they or you are served by those sorts of social bromides. 
[18:32:14] <LionsMane> ok, i'll be back.  I need to get some lunch so I can be done to get to stand up.
[18:32:20] <LionsMane> bbiab 
[18:33:52] <AcidJell0> me three

[21:20:33] <LionsMane> And clearly warn enough so you don't freeze to death...
[21:20:43] <LionsMane> You were saying it was pretty chilly for a while there.
[21:21:18] <lowkey> boing
[21:21:46] <lowkey> hi LionsMane 
[21:27:57] <LionsMane> Good afternoon.
[21:28:28] <lowkey> http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/05/06/first-muslim-miss-usa-rima-fakih-converts-to-christianity.html?intcmp=hpbt4
[21:28:37] <lowkey> how long until they kill her?
[21:29:29] <lowkey> given that apostasy is a death penalty offense for many muslims, seems like it might be dangerous
[21:35:48] <LionsMane> It is like the Italian Mafia...
[21:36:25] <LionsMane> Yeah, well, if she marries the rich dude, at least she'll have some body guards as bullet sponges.
[21:37:46] <lowkey> that might be the secret blessing
[21:39:04] <lowkey> and a lesson in the reality of the world.... you can do anything you want ...if you're wealthy enough
[21:57:10] <LionsMane> Maybe.
[21:57:27] <LionsMane> But wealth is built on the collective acceptance of its value.
[21:57:43] <LionsMane> Consider inflation and hyper inflation.
[21:57:52] <LionsMane> It is a grant, not a right.
[21:59:43] <lowkey> there are no rights.  but if you have enough that others want, you can buy whatever you want.
[22:08:32] <AcidJell0> dang its fly season
[22:10:23] <lowkey> time for fishin!
[22:28:48] <AcidJell0> i wish
[22:28:53] <AcidJell0> i love fly fishing 
[22:29:02] <AcidJell0> but i dont know anything about the flies ... which is a big problem
[22:29:18] <lowkey> that can be the trick
[22:29:24] <AcidJell0> i can buy premade flies and try them out but unless you know what youre doing ... not so good
[22:31:04] <lowkey> the trick is knowing what flies to use at what time of year
[22:32:22] <LionsMane> I go buy my fish at the store...
[22:32:31] <lowkey> cheater!
[22:36:34] <LionsMane> yes
[22:36:38] <LionsMane> Anyway
[22:37:17] <LionsMane> anyone with experience using svn diff â€”git  and git apply?
[22:37:40] <lowkey> that sounds painful
[22:38:09] <lowkey> i made it a point to get all my stuff out of cvs and svn then into git and I haven't looked back
[22:39:18] <LionsMane> lowkey: Yeah, i know 
[22:39:34] <LionsMane> There is a group that is still using svn as their primary rcs
[22:39:42] <LionsMane> Bunch of backwater jackasses.
[22:39:44] <LionsMane> Anyway.
[22:39:50] <LionsMane> Enough of that.
[22:39:53] <lowkey> it can be painful to get out
[22:39:55] <LionsMane> But I am still having trouble.
[22:40:53] <AcidJell0> i get fish at the store too
[22:41:06] <AcidJell0> then i pretend i caught it
[23:02:35] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Hello! I'm seeking the world's countries' test domain names like example.com.
[23:03:22] <AcidJell0> example.ca ?
[23:03:31] <AcidJell0> lol i dont know :)
[23:04:04] <AcidJell0> thats an interesting question
[23:04:24] <AcidJell0> are we assuming that each country has an example domain ?
[23:04:32] <AcidJell0> also what about the global tlds ?
[23:05:33] <Emmanuel_Chanel> I know only Japanese ones and test.ru .
[23:05:39] <lowkey> we should kick canada and mexico off the interwebs.  they're just stealin' from the US
[23:06:11] <Emmanuel_Chanel> About global TLDs, I know example.com , example.net, and so on since they are shown on Wikipedia.
[23:06:12] <AcidJell0> meh ... thats ok im close enough i could probably just steal some wifi over the wall
[23:06:28] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Does example.ca really exist?
[23:06:47] <AcidJell0> but the thing im curious about Emmanuel_Chanel , are you assuming these are owned by the gov of the responsible countries ?
[23:06:54] <lowkey> not when Trump builds the wall!  it will be too tall!
[23:07:38] <AcidJell0> thats only the one with mexico
[23:07:48] <AcidJell0> it will be so tall airplanes would be splattered on it
[23:08:04] <lowkey> well i assume his insanity will spread
[23:08:18] <lowkey> we'll need walls on all borders!
[23:08:25] <lowkey> even between states!
[23:08:54] <lowkey> especially around new york
[23:09:32] <lowkey> think of all the jobs building walls!
[23:09:40] <lowkey> it will be a job boom!
[23:09:50] <lowkey> it will save the economy!
[23:10:42] <AcidJell0> i do want to see a wall on the mehico border :)
[23:12:20] <LionsMane> Ironically, It was Regan that challenged Gorbechev to tear down the Berlin wall.
[23:12:37] <LionsMane> Funny another Republican wants to build them.
[23:12:45] <AcidJell0> slightly diff tho
[23:12:48] <lowkey> that was their wall.  their wall is always inferior to our walls
[23:12:50] <AcidJell0> that wall was between same country
[23:13:42] <AcidJell0> look it, the way i see it there are two options
[23:13:50] <AcidJell0> either build the wall and enforce a border
[23:13:59] <AcidJell0> or just disolve the border entirely
[23:14:36] <lowkey> well given that no wall will ever work to stop the majority of the problem (over staying visas)
[23:14:56] <lowkey> and people will move around whenever there is economic incentive to do so
[23:15:16] <lowkey> trying to stop them is damn near pointless
[23:15:34] <AcidJell0> not when those that jump illegally are the ones that overstay their visas
[23:16:03] <AcidJell0> if you reduce the amount of jumpers then this might be a controllable issue and you might be able to budged for an enforcement agency
[23:16:11] <lowkey> people will always find a way when it makes economic sense.
[23:16:33] <lowkey> its the same with drugs
[23:16:35] <LionsMane> yup
[23:16:42] <LionsMane> I was thinking exactly the same thing.
[23:16:42] <lowkey> laws will never work
[23:16:46] <AcidJell0> see, i think that is part of the problem
[23:16:50] <lowkey> never have
[23:16:54] <lowkey> never will
[23:17:00] <lowkey> its economics 101
[23:17:15] <LionsMane> Prohibition was the same deal.  It just spawned Speakeasy's
[23:17:23] <AcidJell0> governments seem to prioritize on external policy over internal policy
[23:17:26] <lowkey> exactly
[23:17:28] <AcidJell0> mainly because of political gain
[23:17:40] <lowkey> making something illegal seldom makes it impossible to get
[23:17:45] <LionsMane> Some wit the Soviet Black Market.  People could still get what they wanted, if they had enough money.
[23:18:27] <AcidJell0> plz if you compare the quantities of booze nowadays vs prohib there is a clearly visible difference
[23:18:31] <lowkey> government prohibition is price fixing in favor of those willing to provide the service or product
[23:18:37] <AcidJell0> and prohib is a diff situation
[23:18:49] <AcidJell0> youre almost making it sound like the wall will make imigration illegal
[23:19:14] <AcidJell0> its a diff. saying you cant drink at all vs you can only drink 2 galons / day
[23:19:44] <lowkey> yes during prohibition the government thought it was good to allow alcohol that poisoned and killed people to be in circulation.  because it might disincentivize (sp?) the drinkers through fear
[23:20:07] <AcidJell0> lol
[23:20:18] <AcidJell0> whats the equivalent of that with mexicans ?
[23:20:20] <lowkey> its funny but its true
[23:20:30] <AcidJell0> gov allows rapists and murderes ?
[23:20:39] <AcidJell0> its funny but its still done today
[23:20:42] <lowkey> we call them all rapists and murders.  they dont send the best.
[23:20:45] <AcidJell0> but not poison
[23:20:51] <AcidJell0> they put ebkack thing 
[23:20:58] <AcidJell0> in booze
[23:21:37] <lowkey> the fear of illegals is fear of change.  its people that cling to the way things used to be.
[23:21:42] <AcidJell0> lol mmmm delicious rat poison ale
[23:21:45] <lowkey> but reality is things always change.
[23:21:58] <lowkey> just accept it and move on.
[23:22:14] <AcidJell0> so like i said, either put the wall and try to control imigration
[23:22:20] <AcidJell0> or just disolve the borders all together
[23:22:44] <AcidJell0> i agree the current state of affairs is stupid, wasteful
[23:22:49] <AcidJell0> put the money in something else
[23:22:54] <AcidJell0> like poisoned mexicans
[23:22:59] <lowkey> I'm in favor of the second.  and disolving the government while we're at it
[23:23:06] <lowkey> we dont need either
[23:23:35] <AcidJell0> so what would you have for administrative purposes ?
[23:24:04] <AcidJell0> historically centralized governments always proved more powerful vs not
[23:24:11] <lowkey> nothing.  I figure the market would find solutions to what people wanted or needed.
[23:24:46] <AcidJell0> you do realize it would be anarchy
[23:25:05] <lowkey> yes.  it all the wonderful ways.
[23:25:42] <lowkey> you do know I'm an anarchist right?  or did I skip mentioning that part?
[23:25:44] <AcidJell0> you think for the sake of safety and consistency people would not band together ?
[23:26:21] <lowkey> sure people would form spontaneous groups.  but seldom would they use force against others.
[23:26:35] <AcidJell0> right
[23:26:43] <AcidJell0> i mean
[23:26:48] <AcidJell0> that would def. solve some problems
[23:26:56] <AcidJell0> like overpopulation
[23:27:17] <lowkey> it doesn't solve all problems.  but neither does allowing a powerful state.
[23:27:39] <AcidJell0> but anarchy would never ever be possible
[23:27:53] <lowkey> sure it is.
[23:27:56] <AcidJell0> without some brainwashing ray
[23:28:01] <AcidJell0> mass brainwashing ray
[23:28:03] <lowkey> it happens every day, in everyone's lives
[23:28:10] <AcidJell0> not on a global scale
[23:28:12] <lowkey> no one tells you who to be friends with
[23:28:17] <lowkey> or who to sleep with
[23:28:23] <lowkey> or where to eat.
[23:28:38] <lowkey> we all make decisions in the anarchy of life
[23:29:19] <lowkey> countries currently exist in a state of anarchy with regard to each other
[23:29:32] <AcidJell0> within the confinds of morality tho
[23:29:36] <AcidJell0> .. most of the time
[23:29:44] <lowkey> anarchy is the normal state of affairs
[23:30:08] <lowkey> and most people choose to interact with others within the confines of morality as well
[23:30:09] <LionsMane> OK, I need to run.  Have a wonderful weekend, I am hoping to clock a snotload of miles on the moto this weekend.
