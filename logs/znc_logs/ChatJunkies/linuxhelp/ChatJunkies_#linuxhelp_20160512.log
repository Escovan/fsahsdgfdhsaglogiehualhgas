[19:02:40] <LionsMane> Meh
[20:15:48] <LionsMane> So I don't expect to be around Friday or Monday, AcidJell0
[20:15:53] <LionsMane> Going for a riding weekend.  
[20:16:00] <LionsMane> Looking for the good times.
[20:23:27] <AcidJell0> haha
[20:23:34] <AcidJell0> its going to be interesting weather at least
[20:23:50] <AcidJell0> they say saturday and sunday will be rainy and cold
[20:31:54] <LionsMane> Up in your neck of the woods.
[20:32:05] <LionsMane> And I plan on going to ground on Sunday.
[20:32:17] <LionsMane> I'll be traveling Saturday and Monday.
[20:53:43] <AcidJell0> how much in my neck will you actually be ?
[20:53:54] <AcidJell0> as in where exactly ?
[20:54:15] <AcidJell0> Sunday im free from the ball and chain so i might be able to meet you if you got time
[20:56:46] <LionsMane> I'll be in George's Mills on Friday and then heading over to Plainfield MA.  Not really close at all.
[20:57:02] <LionsMane> But as close as i am going to get without actually going to where you are.
[20:57:13] <LionsMane> Just a couple hours north of boston on Friday.
[21:12:12] <LionsMane> Ohh h8 for regex
[21:12:30] <LionsMane> I am happy when it works and sooo unhappy when it doesn't
[21:12:40] <LionsMane> It is like I need a debugger to make it work.
[21:18:18] <LionsMane> So I have a line that looks like this:
[21:18:35] <LionsMane> +++ /dev/null  (revision 999)
[21:18:53] <LionsMane> I need to get rid of everything after the null

[22:36:41] <AcidJell0> doh
[22:36:53] <AcidJell0> i thought you might of been closer
[22:58:38] <LionsMane> Not really, this time.

[23:28:09] <grape> hi all
[23:34:45] *** AcidJell0 is now known as all
[23:34:48] <all> hi grape 
[23:36:07] <grape> hi all 
[23:44:24] *** Joins: lowkey (~lowkey@CJ-5rs.7m7.42.192.IP)
[23:44:37] <lowkey> boing
[23:44:45] <lowkey> hi grape
[23:45:07] * lowkey ignores all
[23:46:29] <all> sup lowkey 
[23:46:38] <all> that would make you quite ignorant :)
[23:46:42] <grape> hi lowkey 
[23:46:50] <grape> how are you?
[23:46:59] <lowkey> pretty good.
[23:47:06] <lowkey> how was your day?
[23:48:51] <grape> hot!
[23:48:55] <grape> summer is here....
[23:49:03] <grape> I think we had 25 Â°C today... or so
[23:49:08] <lowkey> its warmer here but not hot yet
[23:49:11] <grape> and I saw a very good talk yesterday and today
[23:49:36] <lowkey> cool, about what?
[23:52:07] <grape> first one was from the royal astronomer... the one today about big data... for a change actually a good one
[23:52:18] <grape> can I ask you a quick question about systemd?
[23:52:45] <lowkey> fire away
[23:53:53] <grape> how can I start a program as root but let it run as a different (system) user? like exim or apache (apache is different as it needs to start as root to open port 80)?
[23:54:30] <lowkey> i think there's a tag to degrade the user....give me a second...
[23:55:07] <grape> sure
[23:55:12] <grape> I could not find anything today...
[23:56:35] <lowkey> I do believe its the 
[23:56:52] <lowkey> "user=" tag in the [Service] section
[23:58:04] <grape> ok... I will have tinker with that tomorrow... too tired today
[23:58:33] <lowkey> ok it needs a capital U
[23:58:45] <lowkey> and you can use Group= too
[23:58:56] <grape> I got a system group
[23:59:06] <grape> the program I need to use is called jupyter
[23:59:12] <grape> which is python code...
[23:59:48] <grape> I managed to use apache as a proxy... but it needs to be started in a certain directory (else it is using / which is not good)
