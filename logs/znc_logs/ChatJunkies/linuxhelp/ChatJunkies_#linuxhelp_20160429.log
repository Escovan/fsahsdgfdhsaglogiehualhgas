[16:48:54] <AcidJell0> is it ?
[16:49:03] <AcidJell0> i havent decided on mine yet
[16:49:30] <LionsMane> Ah, yeah, I am sort of in the same place.
[16:49:41] <LionsMane> ok, more coffee.
[16:54:35] <AcidJell0> agreed
[17:07:15] <LionsMane> Coffee aquired.
[17:17:17] <AcidJell0> grr
[17:17:24] <AcidJell0> i ran out of coffee here
[17:17:44] <AcidJell0> i must journey outside the gates
[17:22:56] <LionsMane> hehe you live in a gated community?
[17:24:25] <AcidJell0> no ... i just call my door that :)
[17:24:29] <AcidJell0> i wish
[17:39:48] <LionsMane> The gates might have kept the riff raff next door from getting in?
[17:44:03] <AcidJell0> no
[17:44:14] <AcidJell0> just probably means the rift raft couldnt afford it :)
[17:44:56] <AcidJell0> i think im going to go out for a smoke
[17:45:27] <AcidJell0> every time i think about the rift raft and how the gov is f*king me to keep the rift raft happy ... to quote you "i get stabby"
[17:46:00] <LionsMane> hmmm stabby.
[17:51:59] <AcidJell0> verry
[17:52:41] <AcidJell0> i wish i had a choice in not paying taxes
[17:54:16] <LionsMane> yeah, well, there is that.  Would be nice, I suppose.  A different way to "no" vote your local government.
[17:54:17] <LionsMane> :D
[17:54:23] <LionsMane> OK, I am off for lunch.  Later

[23:03:47] <grape> it is good you see somebody here... not so good is the reason why 
[23:04:00] <grape> but then...  I had my burnouts recently
