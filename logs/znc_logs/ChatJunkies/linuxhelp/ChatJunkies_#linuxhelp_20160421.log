[16:54:58] <AcidJell0> hey LionsMane 
[16:56:10] <AcidJell0> boyo
[16:56:22] <AcidJell0> LionsMane U irish ?
[17:13:48] <LionsMane> Why would you think that?
[17:14:31] <LionsMane> As a matter of fact, no, very little Irish, mostly french.  That explains the over hairy nose and ear holes.
[17:42:33] <AcidJell0> i was just curious since youre in the boston area
[17:42:39] <AcidJell0> thought theres lots of iris there
[17:42:49] <AcidJell0> i was sort of craving some irish breakfast
[19:39:29] <LionsMane> Ah my last name is Nolin, not NolAN.  Nolan in solidly Irish.  Nolin is french.
[19:57:21] <AcidJell0> well my name is Andre :) thats pretty french
[19:57:37] <AcidJell0> frankly i didnt know your name is Nolin
[19:58:12] <AcidJell0> now youve narrowed the search criteria that much more :)
[20:51:20] <LionsMane> Don Nolin, in particular
[20:51:26] <LionsMane> Not many of them, to be sure.
[20:51:43] <LionsMane> Nolin is a fairly uncommon name.
[20:52:05] <LionsMane> Altho, my cousin has had 13 children by four women, so he is making up for lost time.
[20:55:48] <AcidJell0> :O
[20:55:53] <AcidJell0> daaaamn
[20:56:09] <AcidJell0> he must be a milionaire
[21:07:09] <LionsMane> He works really hard and his folks are raising four of his kids.
[21:07:19] <LionsMane> He has something like four still at home.
[21:07:39] <LionsMane> and I think after wife one left, he hasn't seen his first three.
[21:07:51] <LionsMane> I think they reconnected once they were adults.
[21:57:35] <AcidJell0> man
[21:57:46] <AcidJell0> i feel like stringing myself up and i have 2 kids
[21:58:10] <AcidJell0> bathroom time is the only time i have
