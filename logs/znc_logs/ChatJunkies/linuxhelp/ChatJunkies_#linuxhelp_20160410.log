[21:51:51] <lowkey> hi grape
[21:51:53] <lowkey> hi all
[21:53:00] <lowkey> anyone else annoyed that git cannot sync any sub-directories that have a .git item in them (so no using git to sync a directory of git repositories)
[21:53:21] <grape> hi lowkey .. phone
[21:53:32] <lowkey> take your time.
[21:53:35] <lowkey> no worries
[22:34:34] <lowkey> git submodules are a pain
[22:44:54] <grape> back
[22:46:25] <lowkey> hi, how was your weekend?
[22:47:54] <grape> was ok... I did not do much yesterday... but today I finished off my power installation in my green house...
[22:48:00] <grape> so I got electricity in there now...
[22:48:07] <grape> and somehow my hair is all upright as well
[22:48:08] <grape> :D
[22:48:17] <lowkey> LOL
[22:48:40] <lowkey> so what are you planning to grow in the greenhouse?
[22:49:24] <grape> tomatoes and some chilies
[22:49:34] <lowkey> mmmmmm chilis
[22:49:39] <grape> next to some spring onions
[22:51:03] <lowkey> add some beef and you can make chili!
[22:51:32] <grape> hehe... that might be an idea
[22:52:28] <grape> oh... and I will grow some herbs as well
[22:52:55] <lowkey> thats what people claim to do here!
[22:53:38] <grape> I was refering to some cinnamon basil...
[22:53:40] <grape> :D
[22:54:17] <lowkey> they have all kinds of names for it but we know what they mean!
[22:55:20] <grape> ll
[22:55:22] <grape> lol
[22:58:23] <lowkey> crap.
[22:58:32] <grape> why?
[22:58:39] <lowkey> one small change to /etc/hosts and now sudo loses its freakin mind
[23:00:07] <grape> lol... I bet you got a very complicated suoders file...
[23:00:50] <lowkey> I just took at mapping out of hosts from local server name to 127.0.0.1
[23:00:58] <lowkey> because of other errors
[23:01:09] <lowkey> and its bring out sudo issues
[23:01:55] <grape> so you are using the host functionality in sudo?
[23:02:24] <lowkey> yep
[23:02:45] <grape> ok
[23:02:47] <grape> I don't
[23:03:52] <lowkey> I shouldn't but it seemed like a good idea back then
[23:04:16] <lowkey> I'm more impressed with the Qubes model these days.  no root password.
[23:04:22] <lowkey> and it works.
[23:04:35] <grape> yeah.... sounds familiar... a good idea at the time :D
[23:07:42] <lowkey> the problem is when I screw up sudo, I need to find the right usb thumbdrive for PAM-USB and remember roots password to be able to su in to fix it
[23:08:30] <grape> ok
[23:08:50] <grape> ok
[23:09:21] <lowkey> but I guess that's better than having to go to another console shell access to login.....
[23:10:33] <lowkey> I am thinking of doing that PAM-USB thing for su for my servers.  That way its unlikely that anyone can use su unless I get forgetful and live the USB connected....
[23:11:34] <lowkey> s/live/leave/
[23:12:12] <grape> mh.. and what do you do if the USB stick breaks?
[23:13:05] <lowkey> then I have to login in rescue mode locally and disable the PAM-USB checks
[23:13:19] <grape> ok
[23:19:58] <lowkey> I was curious how hard it would be to use Xen to setup servers using a similar method to what Qubes uses for each VM
[23:20:24] <lowkey> in that if it would be possible to have the core VM built from a template at each reboot
[23:20:51] <lowkey> so if anyone hacked the server then it would have any changes they made until the next reboot
[23:21:15] <lowkey> and maybe add a cron job to automatically reboot the image once a day
[23:22:02] <lowkey> so if they wanted to make a lasting change they would need to hack the running image, jump through Xen to the template, and change it
[23:22:12] <grape> so basically if one image gets hacked... once it is rebooted it is back to its virgin state, right?
[23:22:21] <lowkey> exactly
[23:23:43] <grape> interesting idea
[23:24:45] <grape> that is somehow similar to what I do on the clusters... every time the node reboots it is using rsync to the headnode where the image is..
[23:24:56] <lowkey> right.
[23:25:07] <grape> so any changes will be overwritten... the only thing I don't do is using the --delete option
[23:25:18] <lowkey> a clean starting point.  
[23:26:00] <grape> well... I am a bit to scared that it goes wrong... and the /home will be deleted... although it is excluded
[23:26:18] <lowkey> that could be bad
[23:27:07] <lowkey> although if /home was on a separate partition and you limited rsync actions to within partition boundaries....
[23:27:12] <grape> I would use some frensh words here :D
[23:27:13] <lowkey> it should be safe.
[23:27:19] <grape> I do
[23:28:08] <lowkey> but the delete options are dangerous
[23:28:15] <lowkey> thats what makes them fun!
[23:28:32] <grape> I prefer a different kind of fun...
[23:28:46] <grape> talking about fun. I had a really nice meal the last two days:
[23:28:52] <grape> asparagus soup
[23:29:14] <grape> potatoe dumplings with yellow beans and rendeer medallions in a pepper sauce
[23:30:19] <lowkey> that sounds good
[23:31:43] <grape> it was actually really nice
[23:32:43] <grape> but the yellow beans taste nice when they are fresh
[23:33:59] <lowkey> oh, I hate when I forget to close a bug report!
[23:35:17] <grape> bugs?
[23:35:23] * grape runs!
[23:37:03] <grape> right... I think I am having an early night tonight...
[23:38:09] <lowkey> ok, and it should be closed when it processes the email.  only two versions late closing it.
[23:38:16] <lowkey> sleep well grape!
[23:40:19] <grape> you too lowkey 
[23:40:31] <grape> ttfn
