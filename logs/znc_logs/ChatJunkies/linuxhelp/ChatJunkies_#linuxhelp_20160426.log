[16:53:19] <LionsMane> The icky smell is coming up from the bowels of the building.
[18:39:24] <AcidJell0> yaay
[18:39:30] <AcidJell0> hmm
[18:39:40] <AcidJell0> are you at the fried chicken place ? :)
[18:40:01] <AcidJell0> what is avahi ...
[18:40:15] <AcidJell0> that thing keeps annoying me
[18:40:55] <AcidJell0> it will be disablord
[19:02:45] <LionsMane> avahi is the daemon used to do multicast DNS and device discovery.  It is a protocol spearheaded by Apple that competes with Universal PnP, developed by Mirc-0-$loth
[19:03:16] <LionsMane> Must apps that support UPnP typically link the libpnp.so to get that support
[19:04:21] <LionsMane> Avahi is a bit more agressive in that each device on the network both advertises its presence on the network AND listens for network broadcasts requesting devices present themselves.
[19:04:43] <LionsMane> It is how a Mac could find a TimeMachine instance on the same network.
[19:05:14] <LionsMane> Typically, it comes with the ability for the local caching DNS server to also include dynamic host names in the DNS resolution.
[20:12:47] <LionsMane> anyway.
[20:42:58] <LionsMane> It is nap time in linuxhelp.
