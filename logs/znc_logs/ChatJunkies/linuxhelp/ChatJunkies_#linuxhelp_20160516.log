[00:20:06] <grape> hi all
[00:20:08] <grape> hi lowkey 
[00:39:34] <lowkey> hey grape
[00:39:42] <lowkey> how was your weekend?
[00:42:01] <grape> pretty goood
[00:42:04] <grape> good even
[00:42:10] <lowkey> sweet
[00:42:32] <grape> I was to a b-day party of one of my former supervisors... and today I enjoyed the sunshine and spent most of the time in my garden
[00:43:58] <grape> and yours?
[00:44:17] <lowkey> fairly good.  I got the new system to use as a firewall in
[00:44:34] <lowkey> and been setting it up.  so its ready when they install our fiber connection
[00:44:44] <lowkey> its probably 90% ready
[00:45:07] <grape> sounds good
[00:45:33] <grape> I got that PC you showed me the other day... I received it on friday... and guess what: it does not work
[00:46:01] <lowkey> no way.  that sucks
[00:46:14] <lowkey> completely dead or just some features?
[00:52:29] <grape> no picture
[00:52:44] <grape> I tried 2 different monitors and hence 2 different HDI cabes
[00:53:40] <lowkey> that seems weird.  does it need to be enabled in some weird way?
[00:54:15] <grape> no... there is only a HDMI and a DVI-D... which is the same socket
[00:54:24] <grape> well... socket type
[00:55:02] <lowkey> wierd.  you think it would autodetect something connected at boot and enable it.
[00:55:27] <lowkey> I know this system I have only enables the HDMI if a cable is connected when it boots....
[00:55:40] <lowkey> well I found that out the hard way
[00:56:33] <grape> well... I wired it all up and then booted.... still only a black screen...
[00:56:41] <grape> the LED for the NICs are on
[00:56:55] <grape> but the num-lock key at the keyboard stays off
[00:57:17] <lowkey> weird
[00:59:49] <lowkey> thats a real bummer
[01:00:18] <lowkey> have you been able to contact the provider to ask for help or a replacement?
[01:01:52] <grape> not yet... it was the weekend...
[01:02:09] <grape> right.. bedtime... it was a late night.. or early morning for me... so I am knackered...
[01:02:11] <grape> ttfn
[01:02:28] <lowkey> sleep well!
[01:02:37] <grape> thanks
[01:02:38] <grape> ttfn
