[00:00:00] <AcidJello> my daughter came home and she had a tick on her ... so that was a scream session
[00:00:22] <AcidJello> lowkey, i often do ... i have tons of copies of postal 2 game
[00:00:33] <AcidJello> that game is a necessary eveil
[00:00:37] <lowkey> seems a bit of an over-reaction
[00:00:45] <AcidJello> or eeeevil
[00:01:01] <AcidJello> kids i guess
[00:01:18] <AcidJello> the more i live in this side of the world the more some things make sense to me
[00:01:58] <lowkey> I recently got an xbox 360 for participating in a medical study.  thinking about taking it in to gamestop because they offer $100 off an xbox one if you take one in
[00:01:59] <grape> AcidJello: how did you remove the rick?
[00:02:07] <lowkey> then get star wars battlefront
[00:02:08] <AcidJello> i grew up on a farm and had access to endless supplies of ticks, fleas lice and all the other natures annoyances so it doesnt surprise me
[00:02:21] <AcidJello> grape, with a pair of tweezers
[00:02:27] <AcidJello> grape, heres the thing that i did learn tho
[00:02:30] <grape> AcidJello: did you make sure the head is gone as well?
[00:02:41] <lowkey> as I recall the best way to get ticks off is with vaseline
[00:02:51] <grape> lowkey: ... they vomit
[00:02:55] <AcidJello> ticks carry lime dissease, supposedly it takes up to 24h to get the actual dissease
[00:03:09] <grape> which is not good as all the viruses and bacterias get into your blood stream
[00:03:15] <AcidJello> grape, im pretty sure it still has its head since its still alive
[00:03:22] * grape had lime disease...
[00:03:30] <AcidJello> i was planning on getting it tested for lime dissease
[00:03:36] <lowkey> thats not good
[00:03:39] <grape> no
[00:03:47] <grape> but you can spot it easily... 
[00:03:47] <AcidJello> but the gov health people said it takes a few months to get the results
[00:03:56] <grape> no... not that long
[00:04:09] <grape> I think a week or so.. but not months... that is rediculus
[00:04:24] <AcidJello> grape, is there any point in trying to figure it out early ?
[00:04:34] <AcidJello> grape, thats government efficiency
[00:05:06] <lowkey> that explains why taking out isis is taking so long
[00:05:16] <lowkey> the paperwork hasn't been processed yet...
[00:06:04] <grape> AcidJello: as if you got it you should start treatment immediately...
[00:06:16] <grape> I had to take penicillin for some time... I thin 2 weeks or so
[00:06:41] <AcidJello> lowkey, you dont think that is true ?
[00:07:27] <lowkey> which?  that government is incompetent?  I firmly believe that
[00:07:28] <AcidJello> grape, at this point im not sure if i should bother to get the tick tested or wait till there are visible signs
[00:07:45] <AcidJello> google says you get some huge red circle around the area
[00:08:07] <AcidJello> lowkey, yes that gov. incompetence plays a role in isis still kicking
[00:09:43] <lowkey> government is a big part, but we can't underestimate the effect that war-weariness had too.
[00:10:07] <lowkey> people are just tired of the forever war generation 2
[00:10:26] <grape> AcidJello: lime looks like a dart board: concentric rings which are red and white
[00:10:46] <grape> however, the bugs can hide... so you don't get any symptoms for some time... 
[00:10:49] <AcidJello> yes thats about what the googles were saying
[00:11:22] <grape> trust me...  that was one of the concerns my doc and I had... specially when I started to get the vertigo
[00:12:05] <lowkey> bah.  after a head injury, you get used to being dizzy all the time
[00:13:06] <grape> well I did not had one...
[00:15:17] <AcidJello> man doesnt sound like a fun dissease
[00:15:23] <lowkey> hey it effects my jogging but I can hack as well as I ever could, if not better
[00:16:26] <grape> what I meant to say was: it was not clear where my vertigo was suddenly comming from...
[00:16:50] <AcidJello> yah, vertigo is one of those things that could be something terrible or ... nothing 
[00:16:53] <AcidJello> like back pain
[00:17:33] <AcidJello> supposedly a lot of people claim stuff like that to get work compensation around here
[00:19:25] <grape> it was no fun when I first had it... 
[00:19:32] <grape> one wrong movement and I lost my balance
[00:20:04] <lowkey> yeah, it can be a bear getting over it or used to it
[00:20:36] <AcidJello> its funny, i used to sail quite a bit
[00:20:49] <AcidJello> and i got used to the movement pretty fast
[00:20:54] <AcidJello> problem was when id get off the boat
[00:20:58] <AcidJello> thats when id get the vertigo
[00:21:14] <AcidJello> id try to mimiq the waves with my legs and get dizzy
[00:21:54] <lowkey> I never got that unless I was at sea more than a few days.  Go to sea for a week or longer then there was no way I could walk a straight line when I first got back on land
[00:24:08] <lowkey> well I take that back
[00:24:26] <lowkey> hit land, drink six pack then I could walk straight.
[00:24:31] <AcidJello> i think this was because the trip i was taking was somewhat purposely wavier then it should of been
[00:24:35] <AcidJello> lol
[00:24:53] <AcidJello> frying pan to the head might work too :)
[00:25:04] <AcidJello> but those good old cast iron frying pans
[00:25:41] <lowkey> one time at sea, we skirted the edge of a class five typhon
[00:26:23] <lowkey> I remember waves going over the conning deck on the ship.  which as I recall was 60ft above normal water levels
[00:27:09] <lowkey> nothing like being on a ship in a storm like that with 200 marines.  probably 190 of them seasick
[00:27:22] <AcidJello> shite
[00:28:08] <AcidJello> thats when you bolt sh*t down :D
[00:28:39] <AcidJello> those new ships are almost unsinkable ... (ofcourse stupidity aside)
[00:29:46] <lowkey> we had all the toliets on our level were back-flowing.  The bathroom was ankle deep in sewage.
[00:30:20] <lowkey> nothing will make you feel smaller than being on a small ship in a big storm far at sea
[00:30:29] * grape been see sick as well
[00:30:50] <lowkey> i was one of the few who didnt get seasick
[00:31:21] <AcidJello> ive been in a few situations like that .. not of that magnitued but def. bad for a small ship like i was on
[00:31:59] <AcidJello> id have to say so far in my life, ive been in at least 3 situations where i 100% accepted the fact i would die
[00:32:14] <lowkey> I was in 28ft seas off California in a vehicle certified for peace-time training 10ft seas, or war-time 15ft seas.
[00:32:33] <grape> I am impressed
[00:32:50] <lowkey> the funny thing is the worse it got, the more I was convinced I'd get out
[00:33:07] <AcidJello> i often go kayaking in 10+ ft seas but those are just waves. the big scarry stuff was breaking waves or the whiteheads
[00:33:16] <AcidJello> if they are breaking then youre introuble
[00:37:00] <lowkey> this was bad enough that we tried to get back on the ship we'd gotten off (an LPD) and the waves would just push the stern around.  we had a hard time lining up to go up the ramp
[00:38:18] <lowkey> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_transport_dock
[00:38:23] <lowkey> one of these ships
[00:39:33] <lowkey> not quite.  I remember the tank deck being different
[00:40:35] <lowkey> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Dubuque_(LPD-8)   there she is
[00:40:37] <AcidJello> sea and air 
[00:40:47] <AcidJello> both things i hate
[00:41:10] <AcidJello> you can control them so much but theres always a huge chance of getting f*d
[00:41:18] <lowkey> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_San_Bernardino_(LST-1189)  Thats the gal I rode in the typhoon
[00:42:02] <AcidJello> whats the arm at the front for ? is that for depth charges ?
[00:42:16] <lowkey> its a bridge.
[00:42:46] <lowkey> the ship is designed to be dragged up as close to the beach as possible.  then it puts down that bridge and lets off the non-amphibious stuff
[00:43:06] <AcidJello> yah i see now, theres another pic
[00:43:12] <AcidJello> man lowkey you must be ancient too :D
[00:43:33] <lowkey> that was the old way of getting non-amphibious stuff on the shore.  now we use LCAC hovercraft to carry everything up to tank size
[00:43:34] <AcidJello> wait
[00:43:42] <AcidJello> i read more, says it also had some action in 95
[00:44:03] <lowkey> I was on that ship in 1991, 1992, 1994 as I recall
[00:44:29] <lowkey> I was on that ship off shore of Korea when Kim Il Sung died
[00:44:53] <grape> ah... now we can track you down lowkey ! :D
[00:45:04] <AcidJello> says its still around in the chilean navy
[00:45:15] <AcidJello> god damn
[00:45:41] <AcidJello> or maybe not says chile decomissioned her in 2011 
[00:45:51] <lowkey> yep.  US government sold the last two LSTs they had.  then soon after realized they had ZERO shallow water assualt ships anymore
[00:46:22] <lowkey> the San B could get its draft down to 10ft.  it could creep right in close to shore
[00:46:36] <AcidJello> they have that new dual hull stealth thing no ?
[00:47:02] <lowkey> I dunno how shallow those go
[00:47:21] <AcidJello> when i was watching some documentary they were saying its pretty good in shallow water
[00:47:29] <AcidJello> but not sure about its cargo capabilities
[00:48:24] <lowkey> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_transport_dock#/media/File:USS_San_Antonio_AAV02.jpg
[00:48:54] <lowkey> I was a crew chief on an AAV like in that photo
[00:49:13] <lowkey> although we never wrapped the guns in our turret like that
[00:49:37] <lowkey> then again the guns aren't mounted then
[00:52:24] <lowkey> we never wrapped our turrets though.  if the waves got that deep it meant the driver needed more schoolin'
[01:02:55] <grape> right, I am off
[01:02:56] <grape> ttfn
[01:03:06] <lowkey> g'nite grape
[01:03:09] <lowkey> sleep well!
[01:03:10] <grape> night lowkey

[16:57:44] <AcidJell0> hola
[16:59:04] <AcidJell0> oh oh alien conspiracy 
[16:59:06] <AcidJell0> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7tlUS6bx04
[17:08:21] <LionsMane> o
[17:08:22] <LionsMane> k
[17:08:24] <LionsMane> yeaoh.
[17:08:31] <LionsMane> Not so much for me.
[17:09:48] <AcidJell0> hehe
[17:12:48] <LionsMane> yeah, ok.
[17:13:14] <LionsMane> These guys remind of my of the guy in XFiles.  The smoking gunmen or something like that.
[17:14:44] <AcidJell0> yah
[17:14:49] <AcidJell0> but hes got good footage
[17:15:00] <AcidJell0> i was reading the /. posts
[17:15:12] <AcidJell0> lots of people seem to think its some sort of reflection of the sun
[17:15:29] <AcidJell0> i have to agree with the conspiracists it doesnt seem like a reflection
[17:15:35] <AcidJell0> i have my money on an explosion
[17:18:56] <LionsMane> explosion?  Like something ramming the ISS?
[17:47:26] <AcidJell0> no
[17:47:33] <AcidJell0> that looks like its far in the distance no ?
[18:00:17] <LionsMane> Sure, but it is hard to say with that camera and lens.
[19:05:18] <AcidJell0> ugh
[19:05:24] <AcidJell0> i hate windows sometimes
[19:05:35] <AcidJell0> i can hear my external drive grinding ... i cannot know what
[19:07:01] <AcidJell0> wait NM perf mon will show me :)
[19:08:35] <LionsMane> That is a good start.
[19:09:24] <AcidJell0> its the same conspiracy theory
[19:09:43] <AcidJell0> since they have such a backstabbing sla makes me think they are spying on you
[19:09:49] <LionsMane> Unlikely.
[19:09:49] <AcidJell0> its not transparent
[19:10:09] <AcidJell0> that was the great thing about linux, you can see whats doing what on your hd
[19:10:13] <AcidJell0> lsof i think
[19:20:07] <LionsMane> Well, sorta, lsof takes a snapshot of the open files by inspecting /proc.  You'd need a different tool to monitor changes to the filesystem.
[19:20:54] <AcidJell0> what like tripwire ?
[19:21:03] <AcidJell0> but thats more of acces
[19:21:23] <AcidJell0> i recall i was playing with file hooks ( forget what it is called ) at one point
[19:24:19] <LionsMane> inotify.
[19:24:28] <LionsMane> It is a kernel facility
[19:24:48] <LionsMane> Tripware likely uses inotify to watch for files being modified.
[20:02:14] <AcidJell0> this is weird
[20:02:17] <AcidJell0> my laptop is touch screen
[20:02:23] <AcidJell0> and i cannot use a stilus on it ...
[20:02:28] <AcidJell0> hows that make sense
[20:07:17] <LionsMane> Well, it depends on how it detects touch.
[20:08:01] <LionsMane> Like the Samsung Tab, it has a non-capacitive stylus that ONLY works with some Samsung devices.
[20:08:11] <AcidJell0> well the tablet the stilus came with works with both finger and stilus
[20:08:52] <LionsMane> And then the Tab as a capacitive touch screen that you can use with your fingers or other pointer that cause a capacitive disturbance on the screen.
[20:10:42] <AcidJell0> way to bring science into this LionsMane :D
[20:11:12] <AcidJell0> i tried to use the stilus onthe touch pad of the laptop and guess what ??
[20:11:19] <AcidJell0> it scratched the sh*t out of it ...
[20:17:55] <LionsMane> Well, you weren't doing it right!
[20:27:07] <AcidJell0> clearly
[20:27:27] <AcidJell0> crazy of me to think a stilus might work on a touch screen :D
[20:27:36] <AcidJell0> oh one of these days it will
[20:27:48] <AcidJell0> ive waited soooo long for paperless stuff
[20:45:46] <LionsMane> I have mostly gone paperless.
[20:46:10] <LionsMane> Oddly, the wiki was the thing that really brought me into the current status without needing paper.
[20:46:45] <LionsMane> The wiki pages tend to organze themselves in smaller chunks that lend well to reading on a non paper device.
[20:59:03] <AcidJell0> i use a lot of hand writing on my tablet
[20:59:12] <AcidJell0> but there is still huuuuuge gaps in integration
[20:59:17] <AcidJell0> my biggest beef is with mail
[20:59:31] <AcidJell0> why da f*k cant i hand write stuff in my emails !!!
[20:59:54] <AcidJell0> oh no, i have to get that sh*tty touch screen kb to come up
[21:00:43] <AcidJell0> dont get me wrong, from last year integration with applications has gotten huuugely improved
[21:01:00] <AcidJell0> pretty much all office applications support it in one capacity or another
[21:01:14] <AcidJell0> ofcourse ... the one application that does NOT support it ... MS Word
[21:01:15] <AcidJell0> noooo
[21:22:19] <AcidJell0> i love code wizzards
[21:22:36] <AcidJell0> its exciting to see what unholy abomination it will come up with
[21:27:27] <AcidJell0> http://news.microsoft.com/stories/invisible-revolution/
[21:27:28] <AcidJell0> doh
[21:28:05] <AcidJell0> my company went to this MS hosted event
[21:28:17] <AcidJell0> they had these gorgeous ww2 pinup girls
[21:28:25] <AcidJell0> wish i would of went :)
[21:33:07] <AcidJell0> man sometimes i think ww2 vets think our generation is a joke
[21:33:17] <AcidJell0> s/sometimes/always/
[22:16:07] <LionsMane> ww2?  World War II?
[22:41:18] <AcidJell0> yes
[22:49:59] <LionsMane> Oh, I like that sort thing.
