[21:16:49] <AcidJell0> now its the whole condo board. i had some cardboard in my driveway so they sent me a letter
[21:18:49] <LionsMane> And they let you next door neighbor do what he does?
[21:21:05] <AcidJell0> they recently redid the driveways
[21:21:19] <AcidJell0> 2000 dollars
[21:21:51] <LionsMane> I guess my point is, what force and effect do they have?
[21:22:16] <LionsMane> Isn't blocking someones' driveway against the rules?
[21:22:22] <AcidJell0> well, they can pay someone to do something like removal and then charge you for it
[21:22:46] <AcidJell0> well yes and no
[21:23:06] <AcidJell0> there are no actual rules about blocking someone
[21:23:12] <AcidJell0> there are rules about parking in the street tho
[21:23:42] <AcidJell0> brb gotta pickup my daughter from babysitter

[22:26:37] <lowkey> boing
[22:26:45] <AcidJell0> sup old man !!
[22:26:54] <lowkey> not much, you?
[22:27:07] <AcidJell0> not much either
[22:27:11] <AcidJell0> emailing people ..
[22:27:42] <lowkey> sounds like fun.
[22:27:56] <lowkey> op...bbiab
[22:28:02] <lowkey> a minute or two
[22:31:47] <lowkey> back
[22:31:54] <lowkey> silly interuptions
[22:33:23] <lowkey> nothing like phones that aren't for you but the other end is bored and wants to talk anyway
[22:41:53] <AcidJell0> i dont care anymore
[22:42:01] <AcidJell0> as soon as i hear indian accent its hangup 
[22:42:17] <lowkey> i have one exception to that rule.
[22:42:23] <AcidJell0> the odd time i give them a go f*k your mother and then run down the stairs with a pair of scissors
[22:42:32] <AcidJell0> bit
[22:42:49] <AcidJell0> lol
[22:42:59] <lowkey> if it's someone calling from the "Windows Support Department", and I have time ... then I see how long I can keep them on the line
[22:43:10] <AcidJell0> haha
[22:43:16] <AcidJell0> i tried that a few times
[22:43:25] <LionsMane> :)
[22:43:32] <AcidJell0> sort of wanted to see if i can get some info out of them that can get me closer to where they are
[22:43:41] <lowkey> record so far is just over 30 minutes before they figured out I was fucking with them
[22:43:58] <AcidJell0> oh i had them longer then that
[22:44:03] <AcidJell0> i had them call back too
[22:44:30] <AcidJell0> saying stuff like oh sorry my daughter just fell and hurt herself, please call back i dont want to be in trouble with Microsoft windows support
[22:44:30] <lowkey> I have gotten call backs... from those who claim to be supervisors
[22:45:21] <lowkey> I got one call back because I insisted they should have a Microsoft issued support ID that I could verify
[22:45:36] <AcidJell0> ooh thats a good one
[22:45:38] <AcidJell0> did they ?
[22:45:52] <lowkey> then when they called back with the ID, I cut them off and said "No official Microsoft ID starts with 90..."
[22:46:08] <AcidJell0> oh no
[22:46:14] <AcidJell0> you should of taken it down and checked it
[22:46:51] <lowkey> I figured when they hung up it was proof it was an attempt to just create a number and see if I accepted it
[22:47:23] <lowkey> I wonder how much time they spent after that researching Microsoft Support IDs
[22:47:24] <AcidJell0> i had the feeling that they went to some trouble to get some genuinely sounding info
[22:47:30] <AcidJell0> could be they might of stolen an id
[22:47:40] <lowkey> that is possible.
[22:47:56] <AcidJell0> probably not much, they buy those like phone cards in india
[22:48:06] <AcidJell0> just go downstairs to your local convenience store and buy some
[22:48:06] <lowkey> if they did, I would assume they would challenge my assertion that No ID starts with 9
[22:48:41] <AcidJell0> only Bill Gates's id starts with 9 :D
[22:48:51] <lowkey> that might work too
[22:49:12] <lowkey> all IDs that started with 9 expired last year.  do you have a new ID?
[22:49:27] <AcidJell0> lool
[22:49:47] <AcidJell0> funny thing
[22:49:53] <AcidJell0> is they got my wife prior to me
[22:50:02] <AcidJell0> and the dumbass was on her laptop going to their site 
[22:50:08] <AcidJell0> had her wallet out and all
[22:50:14] <lowkey> ouch
[22:50:34] <AcidJell0> i dont think she had a credit card at the time but she was going to give them some id information
[22:50:48] <AcidJell0> oh man
[22:51:00] <AcidJell0> should of pretended i was beating her up for breaking the computer
[22:51:01] <lowkey> that would have been bad.
[22:51:16] <AcidJell0> then a loud bang and some screems
[22:51:40] <lowkey> fortunately I have everyone here trained that I do the support so those calls come to me
[22:51:53] <AcidJell0> lol
[22:52:02] <lowkey> and then I ask them, OK which computer is sending you the message, I have a LOT here
[22:52:12] <lowkey> give me an IP or a MAC address.  
[22:52:20] <lowkey> something to start looking
[22:52:36] <AcidJell0> "Oh, yes im quite interested. Im busy right this moment, just give me your phone number and ill call you back at dinner time"
[22:52:59] <AcidJell0> if you ever find an address, give me a shout ill buy a plane ticket with you
[22:53:07] <AcidJell0> baseball bat those MFrs
[22:53:28] <AcidJell0> then convert to islam and claim sharia
[22:53:51] <LionsMane> hahahah
[22:54:05] <lowkey> "I manage a thousand systems, I'm not running your software on each one to try and find the problem.  If one of my systems is reporting to Microsoft that there is a problem, it should include some form of system ID.  Otherwise you want me to believe the MS developers are fools..."
[22:54:31] <AcidJell0> lol
[22:56:00] <lowkey> I've never had someone try to give me a fake MAC address.  some will ask what's a MAC?
[22:56:28] <lowkey> I keep waiting for one to try giving me an IP
[22:56:42] <lowkey> at best they can give the phone number they called....
[22:57:32] <AcidJell0> most likely just skype
[22:57:51] <lowkey> but not even a well trained scam artist
[22:58:40] <lowkey> If someone asked me for the IP, I would start with "well the error routed through a 192.168.0.1..."  because that's the default internal IP for tons of home routers
[23:00:10] <lowkey> and after that guess a 192.168.0.x IP. if they claimed it wasn't on their network ask if they had the router set to dynamically change IPs as people connect because that is so common and it might explain the change in IP
[23:00:11] <AcidJell0> 127.0.0.1
[23:00:30] <lowkey> that could be good given that everyone has that one
[23:01:37] <AcidJell0> i think this would work best if you pretended to be a chick
[23:01:56] <AcidJell0> and wanted to skype them because they so smart and you find smart guys sexxay
[23:02:14] <lowkey> that could be interesting
[23:02:26] <AcidJell0> altho i would have a hard time pulling a chicks voice :)
[23:02:33] <lowkey> me too.
[23:02:33] <AcidJell0> altho i guess you could synth something like that
[23:02:47] <lowkey> I generally get them to think they're helping me.
[23:02:59] <AcidJell0> you could probably play the role to a point where a face to face meeting needs to happen
[23:03:16] <lowkey> 'Press the "start" button'  'I don't see it'
[23:03:35] <lowkey> 'It's on the bottom'  'I see a clock'
[23:03:46] <AcidJell0> there is no start button, i have a shift button, a tab button a capslk button
[23:03:57] <lowkey> 'Other side'  'No start button, there is a K button...'
[23:04:28] <AcidJell0> oh that would be funny
[23:04:36] <AcidJell0> what version of windows are you running sir ?
[23:04:39] <AcidJell0> Fedora 23
[23:04:43] <LionsMane> hahaha
[23:04:45] <LionsMane> !
[23:04:48] <LionsMane> yesss!
[23:04:49] <LionsMane> hehehe
[23:04:59] <lowkey> the EXE you told me to download, wont run on this system.  its giving me an error
[23:05:10] <lowkey> yep
[23:05:17] <LionsMane> I have called for support on my Dell laptop and the first thing they ask is to reboot and log in.
[23:05:42] <lowkey> rebooting fixes most windows issues. 
[23:11:44] <AcidJell0> i had a hard time with Dell support too
[23:12:00] <AcidJell0> i called them once and first thing they ask the model and windows version
[23:12:13] <AcidJell0> i said that im running linux and not windows
[23:12:26] <lowkey> the only time I called them I had to have something overnight out and had a business contract so it was fairly simple
[23:12:48] <AcidJell0> funny thing i called them to buy more ram modules
[23:12:49] <AcidJell0> ...
[23:13:10] <lowkey> I recently bought a new 8GB stick for my laptop.
[23:13:16] <AcidJell0> then she didnt know what ram to look since i guess her program wouldnt accept linux as os
[23:13:26] <AcidJell0> i give you tons
[23:13:30] <lowkey> took out a 2GB stick and put in the 8GB.  new total 12G
[23:13:39] <AcidJell0> should of told me
[23:13:49] <AcidJell0> ive got shitloads of hardware around
[23:13:52] <lowkey> this was cheap.  $30 for 8GB
[23:14:09] <lowkey> SODIMM ?
[23:14:23] <AcidJell0> whichever kind you want
[23:14:28] <lowkey> nice
[23:14:34] <AcidJell0> i keep having to do that
[23:14:55] <lowkey> well I'm now over the max the laptop manufacture claims is the max supported
[23:14:59] <AcidJell0> i get ram from work, then i tell them what do i do with the old stuff ? can you send me some RMA to send them back
[23:15:01] <AcidJell0> no answer
[23:15:42] <lowkey> that seems like an oversight on their part
[23:15:56] <AcidJell0> i have a padlock hd from them
[23:16:12] <AcidJell0> just cheaper to leave it here
[23:16:24] <lowkey> could be
[23:16:37] <AcidJell0> never even plugged it in
[23:16:50] <AcidJell0> funny with the padlock drive
[23:17:01] <AcidJell0> i ask them what the pw is and its something like 1111
[23:17:06] <AcidJell0> im ok ... how do i change it ?
[23:17:10] <AcidJell0> DONT DONT CHANGE IT
[23:17:16] <AcidJell0> if you forget it your f*d
[23:17:26] <AcidJell0> sooo i dont use it
[23:18:21] <lowkey> can't change the password.......then whats the fscking point?
[23:19:02] <AcidJell0> no he said DONT change it
[23:19:12] <AcidJell0> i guess too many people changed it and forgot it :D
[23:19:18] <AcidJell0> then lost all their shit
[23:19:53] <lowkey> so their solution is to use one password for everyone..... that's unbreakable!
[23:21:55] <AcidJell0> i guess its a deterrant ... 
[23:22:06] <AcidJell0> i doubt they are worried about corporate espionage
[23:22:10] <AcidJell0> more of kids stealing shit
[23:22:23] <lowkey> its proof that the real risk in any security system is that people are stupid.
[23:22:27] <AcidJell0> funny story
[23:22:28] <AcidJell0> true story
[23:22:37] <AcidJell0> worked for this company whom we shall not name
[23:23:02] <AcidJell0> they recently got sued by PETA for animal cruelty, had one of those videos surface etc
[23:23:08] <AcidJell0> big law suit
[23:23:25] <lowkey> thats generally bad
[23:23:47] <AcidJell0> woman in charge of presenting documents to the court on behalf of the company
[23:24:06] <AcidJell0> got her laptop encrypted by some virus
[23:24:42] <lowkey> ouch
[23:25:06] <AcidJell0> they had to pay like 100 bitcoins
[23:25:26] <AcidJell0> so what do you do
[23:25:45] <AcidJell0> i dont know the sum exactly in bitcoins but it was around 20k dollars
[23:26:08] <lowkey> the company I worked at before my head injury, their CFO got hit by one of the first ransomeware viruses.  only cost them some 10 or so bitcoins
[23:26:09] <LionsMane> I think bitcoins are much smaller than that.
[23:26:14] <LionsMane> Prolly 100k bitcoin.
[23:26:39] <lowkey> bitcoin is $449 now
[23:26:43] <AcidJell0> the it manager sort of coaxes this chick into thinking its ok and hes gonna come to her rescue
[23:27:01] <AcidJell0> looks into bitcoins and realizes is a fuckload of money that he cant just hide off his budget 
[23:27:02] <AcidJell0> so
[23:27:05] <AcidJell0> whats he do ?
[23:27:25] <lowkey> tell her she's fucked
[23:27:27] <AcidJell0> yep sets up a bunch of the servers for mining
[23:27:41] <AcidJell0> oh hes fucking her at this point
[23:28:10] <lowkey> not sure you could mine that many bitcoin fast enough to matter
[23:28:16] <AcidJell0> realizes it will take forever to mine that much bitcoin :D
[23:28:21] <AcidJell0> yep
[23:28:24] <lowkey> right
[23:28:37] <lowkey> even a few years ago, it would take days to get just one
[23:28:41] <AcidJell0> eventually he used the company credit card to buy the bitcoin
[23:28:44] <lowkey> with a fast rig
[23:29:03] <AcidJell0> thats still good tho
[23:29:05] <lowkey> bah.  this is why you mandate a good backup policy
[23:29:11] <AcidJell0> i mean a few days to make 500$
[23:29:36] <AcidJell0> i mean from the story you realize this wasnt the smartest ran company out there :D
[23:29:41] <lowkey> thats on a rig that cost $2-3K
[23:29:43] <AcidJell0> animal cruelty, idiot it manager
[23:29:52] <lowkey> so your first 6 coins just pay for the rig
[23:30:02] <AcidJell0> 500$ a week would repay that in a few months
[23:30:27] <AcidJell0> i often wondered about some mining machines
[23:30:35] <lowkey> you could but it be successful at mining, you need a small cluster of machines
[23:30:36] <AcidJell0> theres some crazy ads for some out there
[23:31:00] <AcidJell0> claims like .5 bitcoin/ day
[23:31:00] <lowkey> mining isn't profitable at small scale anymore
[23:31:04] <AcidJell0> at around 5k price tag
[23:31:11] <lowkey> those ads are generally lies.
[23:31:29] <LionsMane> And mining doesn't turn up as much as it used to.
[23:31:33] <AcidJell0> thats what is stopping me, the more miners you get the more complex the algorith so it gets more intense
[23:31:41] <lowkey> the block chain has grown to the point that even large scale mining has issues
[23:31:42] <LionsMane> My boss at Nokia used to go bitcoin mining.
[23:31:58] <lowkey> back in the day it was a good idea
[23:32:09] <LionsMane> He said the "find rate" just kept getting lower an lower, to the point that there was no point.
[23:32:19] <lowkey> unfortunately I had a radeon video card and that made it a no go for me
[23:32:32] <lowkey> an nvidia card had some good mining alternatives
[23:32:36] <LionsMane> lowkey: I think he was using an NVidia card
[23:32:41] <LionsMane> yeah yeah exactly.
[23:33:09] <AcidJell0> supposedly they have special chips out there now for bitmining
[23:33:18] <lowkey> yep
[23:33:19] <AcidJell0> they even give the wattage required to run these things
[23:34:12] <lowkey> I read a few months ago that we were approaching the point that if you have to pay for the electricity then mining bitcoin is actually a loss on investment now
[23:35:11] <lowkey> no I think when I read that bitcoin was in the $300 range
[23:35:18] <lowkey> so its probably different now
[23:36:28] <AcidJell0> well i mean you have to pay for electricity either way
[23:36:33] <AcidJell0> unless you have a solar rig going
[23:36:49] <lowkey> that costs you money to install
[23:37:48] <AcidJell0> yes
[23:37:54] <AcidJell0> fat people
[23:38:02] <AcidJell0> use them to power your rig
[23:39:37] <lowkey> hey! some of us resemble that remark!
[23:39:56] <AcidJell0> why is that ?
[23:40:03] <AcidJell0> its a win win situation
[23:40:12] <AcidJell0> create a gym where membership is free if youre fat
[23:40:33] <AcidJell0> you just have to commit to like 1 hour exercise bike per day workout
[23:40:48] <LionsMane> AcidJell0: Do you think many people who go to the gym think that they are actually trim?
[23:41:04] <AcidJell0> oh for sure
[23:41:08] <AcidJell0> at least at my gym
[23:41:12] <LionsMane> The gym is the Church of Guilt!
[23:41:27] <AcidJell0> its a f*n runway for show offs
[23:41:35] <LionsMane> They pray to the god of "If I could only…"
[23:41:45] <AcidJell0> dude at my gym i think the people that need to be there are a minority
[23:41:46] <LionsMane> AcidJell0: I don't know about that.  
[23:42:12] <AcidJell0> its a social club for school kids
[23:42:24] <LionsMane> Well, ok, there is a difference between "need to be there" and the belief "I am fat because I have 6 per cent body fat, but I want 5%"
[23:42:27] <LionsMane> BIG difference.
[23:42:55] <AcidJell0> right, in a way everyone needs it
[23:43:14] <lowkey> gym i go to is mostly old people who are generally skinny.  I'm always tempted to tell them the best thing they can do is go eat a couple cheeseburgers
[23:43:16] <AcidJell0> but i mean people like me that really need it, or ppl that are 2 donuts away from diabetes
