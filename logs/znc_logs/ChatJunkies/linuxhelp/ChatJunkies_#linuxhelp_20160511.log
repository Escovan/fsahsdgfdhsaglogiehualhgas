[00:47:07] <lowkey> ok basic implementation of the feature in place.
[01:19:47] <lowkey> and a little more learning teaches us that this will be insanely difficult to create.

[17:52:39] <AcidJell0> hey
[17:52:46] <AcidJell0> ole grumpy f*er is back :D
[17:56:11] <LionsMane> sniff it, jackhandle
[17:56:29] * LionsMane makes muttering noises about "Ikillyouall"
[17:57:40] <AcidJell0> wrong person, i wouldnt sniff jack chronic sinus issues render my sense of smell inexistant
[18:12:06] <LionsMane> The stink is optional.
[18:12:10] <LionsMane> Anyway.
[18:12:22] <LionsMane> Yeah, maybe I'll try to NOT be a jackass today.
[18:12:29] <LionsMane> Not sure anything will come of it.
[18:16:55] <AcidJell0> im just busting your balls
[18:17:09] <AcidJell0> nothing else of substance to talk about ...
[18:17:21] <AcidJell0> im having 2 weeks of vacation in july
[18:17:27] <AcidJell0> sort of stressed out about that
[18:18:25] <LionsMane> You are stressed about taking a vacation?  Am I reading that right?
[18:27:36] <AcidJell0> yah
[18:27:42] <AcidJell0> i gotta get all this shit ready 
[18:27:53] <AcidJell0> since i have another kid now i need more room in the car
[18:28:02] <AcidJell0> got 2 kids 2 adults and a dog
[18:28:18] <AcidJell0> cant stuff the cur with all the camping gear and the people
[18:28:23] <AcidJell0> so i need to get a trailer
[18:28:46] <AcidJell0> was also hoping to get a canoe but ...
[18:30:02] <AcidJell0> not to mention the weather has been super cold so far
[18:30:06] <AcidJell0> and im not going south :)
[18:30:18] <AcidJell0> so, im sorta worried it will be too cold
[18:31:18] <LionsMane> Ah
[18:31:48] <LionsMane> yeah, I see the logistics being a bit of a thing.  At least, going out into the wild, the girlfriend won't have too many opportunities to go shopping and spend money.
[18:31:50] <LionsMane> :D
[18:32:02] <AcidJell0> haha yes
[18:32:17] <AcidJell0> funny thing is were going through michigan 
[18:32:24] <LionsMane> maybe she can fall off something.
[18:32:28] <AcidJell0> were thinking of staying a night somewhere on the way
[18:32:30] <LionsMane> I dunno.  Just spamming ideas.
[18:33:01] <LionsMane> So putting the girlfriend in the crate and sharing the bed with the dog, not so much of a good idea?
[18:33:21] <AcidJell0> well theres also the two kids
[18:33:28] <AcidJell0> so im hoping shell at least babysit
[18:34:11] <AcidJell0> while i go fishing in the woods and get eaten by a bear ... move to another province and start life as a new person
[18:34:19] <AcidJell0> maybe illegally imigrate to the US
[18:34:24] <AcidJell0> seems to be easy enough :)
[18:35:38] <LionsMane> There are people that fall down the grand canyon every year, very few questions asked.
[18:35:49] <LionsMane> ok, I am off to get some lunch, bbl

[20:17:57] <LionsMane> …. aaaaaand I need ice cream.  Well, not NEED.  But want really bad.
[20:25:09] <AcidJell0> hmm
[20:25:17] <AcidJell0> im trying to go sugarfree as much as possible
[20:25:24] <AcidJell0> i managed pretty well these last 3 days
[20:25:34] <AcidJell0> exceptions being fruit ... just couldnt help myself
[20:25:44] <AcidJell0> today i had 2 coke zeros
[20:28:54] <AcidJell0> good news is i might have sourced a trailer
[20:28:59] <AcidJell0> perfect size too

[21:34:46] <AcidJell0> so thinking about going for the iron butt award this year ?
[21:34:56] <AcidJell0> why not come up to canada
[21:35:06] <AcidJell0> where our liberal government can tax the sh*t out of you too
[21:42:27] <LionsMane> Oh that sounds utterly delightful.
[21:42:28] <LionsMane> Not
[21:55:27] <AcidJell0> itchy nutsack
[21:55:50] <LionsMane> Yeah, something more like that.
[21:56:06] <LionsMane> How far are you, measured in hours, from Boston?
[21:56:28] <AcidJell0> hmm
[21:56:42] <LionsMane> Google is your pal.
[21:57:47] <AcidJell0> google saiz 8h
[21:58:56] <LionsMane> hmm
[21:59:07] <LionsMane> So a weekend trip…
[21:59:28] <LionsMane> I can do 10hrs a day pretty easily.  13hrs is a stretch.
[22:27:17] <grape> hi LionsMane 
[22:29:54] <LionsMane> Hi there grape
[22:33:48] <AcidJell0> hmm
[22:33:56] <AcidJell0> depends on what kindof riding you do
[22:34:02] <AcidJell0> and how the roads are too
[22:35:05] <AcidJell0> i remember when i used to own a motorcycle i used to go for rides just for the hell of it
[22:35:19] <AcidJell0> sometimes id end up in some nice areas, i would turn around and do it again :)
[22:35:54] <AcidJell0> funny i picked a random spot in boston
[22:36:00] <AcidJell0> 19-21 hooker st
[22:38:03] <grape> bbl
[22:40:35] <LionsMane> AcidJell0: I used to live on hooker st.
[22:41:05] <AcidJell0> haha
[22:41:19] * AcidJell0 mind is in the gutter
[22:41:27] <LionsMane> I used to live at 112 Hooker St, Allston, MA
[22:41:50] <LionsMane> It was an AWESOME place to live, but a bit away from public transportation.
[22:42:09] <LionsMane> I mean the 66 ran continuously, but traffic made it unreliable.
[22:42:41] <LionsMane> Something like every 6 minutes during rush hour and 12 minutes off peak.  
[22:43:06] <LionsMane> Problem was, if traffic was bad, three or four buses would stack up and I'd have to wait 30 minutes for a bus to show up.
[22:51:11] <AcidJell0> is boston where they have that bus that goes in the water too ?
[22:55:12] <LionsMane> Yes, the ducks.
[22:55:40] <LionsMane> It is basically a duce and a half with a boat body as a mix in.
[22:56:21] <LionsMane> The things are barely buoyant.  
[23:01:56] <AcidJell0> lol
[23:02:13] <AcidJell0> are they a novelty item or they are daily use items ?
[23:05:53] <LionsMane> hahaah well, the military contracted to use them in WWII
[23:06:04] <LionsMane> They were not ready before the end of the war.
[23:08:05] <LionsMane> As for daily use… well… A Duck sank in a lake near San Antonio TX.  It sank so fast, everyone drowned
[23:08:18] <LionsMane> So… maybe not so much for the everyday use...
[23:09:55] <LionsMane> ok, I need to run.  Grab a car out of the car wash.  Chat tomorrow.
