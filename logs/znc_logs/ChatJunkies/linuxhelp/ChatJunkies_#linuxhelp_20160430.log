[00:00:19] <LionsMane> It is a voluteer auction. That is, people voluteer goods and services and then others bid on them.  The money goes to a non-profit org that I work with.
[00:00:26] <LionsMane> IT is a huge mess of fun.
[00:00:47] <LionsMane> The auctioneer is a stand up comedian, and he ridicules the audience as they are biding.
[00:06:11] <grape> sounds like good fun to me
[00:08:42] <LionsMane> It really is.
[00:10:15] <grape> good to know
[00:10:20] <grape> which charity is that?
[00:17:26] <LionsMane> It is a non-profit, not exactly a charity.
[00:17:36] <LionsMane> It is the Human Awareness Institute.
[00:17:49] <LionsMane> They are a personal growth workshop series.
[00:17:58] <LionsMane> You can find them at HAI.org.
[00:19:12] <grape> ok... I put non-profit == charity
[00:19:35] <LionsMane> Well, here is the US, churches are considered non-profit.
[00:19:51] <LionsMane> But the idea behind a non-profit is avoid some taxes.
[00:20:05] <LionsMane> And, of course, the company doesn't have shareholders.
[00:20:19] <LionsMane> There are a number of limitations on holdings and contributions.
[00:20:33] <grape> ok... and what is a charity then?
[00:20:47] <grape> I thought these are the same things but different names for it
[00:21:38] <LionsMane> Charities are more like taking in money and giving it to the less fortunate.
[00:21:43] <grape> ok
[00:21:47] <LionsMane> Like the Red Cross.
[00:22:05] <LionsMane> Tho, the Red Cross is very good at spending the money it has on non-direct services.
[00:23:16] * grape can do that as well
[00:26:29] <LionsMane> Well, if you can show the paperwork for it, then, yup, you can be a 503c non-profit here in the US, too.
[00:26:53] <LionsMane> Huh, I wonder if you have to be a legal US citizen.  I don't see why you would, but I don't know tax code.
[00:26:58] <grape> :-)
[00:27:11] <grape> I got no idea...
[00:27:24] <grape> all I know is that Panama is currently a hot topic
[00:27:28] <grape> for taxes
[00:37:28] <grape> LionsMane: I met the new guy today...
[00:40:21] <LionsMane> Huh, I have no idea what is going on with Panama
[00:40:37] <LionsMane> The new guy?  Is this  a cow-orker or a new peer?
[00:41:47] <grape> no... I don't get a cow-orker... I have to make use of the useless-cow-orker
[00:42:11] <grape> the new academic who is coming in July... with a full rack of kit!
[00:43:13] <grape> management is going severely wrong for some time now: I complain about too much work and I get told to utilise somebody who is not up for the job... to phrase it nicely
[00:43:23] <grape> *and* I get more work
[00:47:39] <LionsMane> So the new guy is another "client" you have to support?
[00:50:24] <grape> yes sir!
[00:50:42] <grape> more work with the same resources... and I am already streched to the limit#
[00:51:10] <LionsMane> Ah, I see.  yeah.  I can see that being a problem.
[00:51:51] <grape> it does not end.... that is the problem...
[00:52:09] <grape> I am asking for qualified help and I get told to use somebody who perfected the art of procastination...
[00:52:15] <grape> and he is the youngest...
[00:52:44] <LionsMane> Did you recently change bosses?
[00:53:41] <grape> yes
[00:53:59] <grape> but without new human resources the underlying problem stays the same
[01:02:04] <LionsMane> Your boss can do anything about your lame peer?
[01:02:51] <grape> my new boss is not his boss... 
[01:03:03] <grape> and the problem is you need to do permanently something.. 
[01:03:18] <grape> currently people just do something... and then it works... for a few weeks...
[01:04:31] <grape> how much has cloning progressed now?
[01:04:39] <LionsMane> hahaha
[01:04:55] <LionsMane> you'd want to subject your clone to your job?
[01:04:58] <LionsMane> That is just mean.
[01:05:02] <LionsMane> ;>
[01:05:04] <LionsMane> :P
[01:05:50] <grape> yes... clone myself
[01:09:54] <LionsMane> If you say so.  Did you see the British comedy called HyperDrive?
[01:11:33] <grape> nope... 
[01:11:46] <grape> there is a movie where the guy clones himself...
[01:19:28] <LionsMane> no, not exactly.
[01:19:58] <LionsMane> It is a silly show set in space, but the characters are a bunch of screw ups like Young Ones or IT Crowd.
[01:20:18] <LionsMane> But one of the characters ends up cloning himself.  It is quite a thing to see, grape
[01:20:34] <grape> ok
[01:21:13] <grape> but I am not sure whether the world is ready for another grape 
[01:23:01] <grape> have I told you I am going to Australia in July? LionsMane ?
