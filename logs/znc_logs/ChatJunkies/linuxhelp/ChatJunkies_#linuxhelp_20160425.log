[21:39:32] <grape> hi all
[21:39:33] <grape> hi LionsMane 
[21:40:52] <LionsMane> Howdy grape
[21:42:26] <grape> how are you doing? how was your weekend?
[21:43:05] <LionsMane> Great weekend, lots of mile on the moto.  Today started well with a bicycle ride to work.
[21:46:23] <grape> how long does it take you to get into work?
[21:46:50] <LionsMane> It is just over 4 miles
[21:47:09] <LionsMane> Less than 30 mintues.
[21:50:32] <grape> that is doable....
[21:51:01] <grape> for mit it would take over 1h... that is a bit too much.. given it is (heavy) traffic at times... plenty of red traffic light etc..
[21:51:07] <grape> and hills!

[22:06:49] <LionsMane> ok, now.
[22:09:17] <grape> now what? :D
[22:09:35] <grape> ok.. I need to ask somebody who speaks american english...
[22:09:58] <grape> obama said when he was here and talked about the BREXIT that... england will need to join the queue again...
[22:11:09] <grape> the MP from UKIP told us that this is british english.. and the american would say: ..and join the line again
[22:11:19] <grape> is he right? or do you use both?
[22:17:48] <grape> bbl
[22:19:25] <LionsMane> Obama might have been trying to be international in his speak.
[22:19:47] <LionsMane> I hear "queue" from time to time outside the tech usages.
[22:20:04] <LionsMane> I hear petrol here in the US, but rarely.
[22:20:59] <grape> ok... as the MP basically try to tell us: that was Cameron speaking through Obama
[22:24:47] <grape> bbl
[22:28:19] <LionsMane> Huh.  I don't follow international all that much.  I used to listen to be BBC world news when I went to bed at midnight.
[22:28:37] <LionsMane> I liked that a great deal, but I haven't been to bed by midnight in a very long time.
[22:32:25] <AcidJell0> hola
[22:34:24] <LionsMane> Squeee.
[22:37:53] <grape> buneos notches AcidJell0 
[22:38:29] <AcidJell0> buenos notches to you to grape
[22:40:04] <grape> ah... my spelling was correct? that is a surprise... :-)
[22:48:58] <LionsMane> heh.
[22:51:40] <grape> bbl
[23:54:03] <grape> back!
