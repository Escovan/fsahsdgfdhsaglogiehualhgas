[17:33:19] <AcidJell0> Hello LionsMane 
[17:35:16] <LionsMane> Good morning, AcidJell0
[17:36:00] <AcidJell0> its starting good
[17:37:07] <LionsMane> Don't you have to do timesheets today?
[17:44:49] <AcidJell0> done already
[17:44:56] <LionsMane> Nice.
[17:44:59] <AcidJell0> its not hard to do when i have actual quantifiable work
[17:45:07] <AcidJell0> its all the bs that i have a hard time clocking
[17:45:30] <AcidJell0> like when i have to talk to people hours and hours over days to get them to allow some actual work
[17:45:52] <AcidJell0> ive always suggestedd to my company to ask for payment upfront
[17:46:09] <AcidJell0> well do the estimate and documentation with it
[17:46:19] <AcidJell0> they can think about it agree or not and when they agree pay
[17:46:32] <AcidJell0> if they agree with a 200 hour work bill then pay 200 hours up front
[17:47:03] <AcidJell0> this way youll see how much faster they come up with specs and mobilize resources to cater to timelines
[17:54:22] <LionsMane> yeah, I hear the wisdom of your idea.  Andâ€¦ some projects will always fill the space allocated to it.
[17:55:31] <LionsMane> ok, i am getting lunch, bbiab.  Today is Marvel Monday.

[18:25:06] <AcidJell0> holly sh*t its lunch time already
[18:41:33] <LionsMane> yup
[18:45:05] <LionsMane> I am doing Marvel Monday.
[18:45:11] <LionsMane> Today we are finishing antMan.
[18:51:45] <AcidJell0> if i recall correctly ant was some sort of java build or compiler something about java
[18:52:07] <AcidJell0> cant say i have much against antman :)
[18:52:13] <AcidJell0> i dont really like the Daredevil
[18:52:28] <LionsMane> Ah, yes, there is a build system for java called ant.
[18:52:31] <AcidJell0> but hes associated with Punisher so ... i tolerate him by proxy :)
[18:52:46] <LionsMane> It is is basically cmake for java, written in java.
[19:02:06] <AcidJell0> hmm
[19:02:12] <AcidJell0> its lunch time
[19:02:29] <AcidJell0> when you say cmake and i see cake :D sort of sure of it
[19:09:24] <LionsMane> hahaha,  yeah, ok.

[19:28:07] <grape> hi all
[19:28:08] <grape> hi LionsMane 
[19:28:32] <LionsMane> Howday grape
[19:33:05] <grape> ho was your day?
[19:41:25] <LionsMane> This one is a "not so good one"
[19:44:41] <grape> does not sound good...
[19:50:02] <LionsMane> It is not the most horrible day.  But I am not feeling like being at work.
[19:50:13] <LionsMane> It was very nearly a mental health day today.
[19:50:24] <LionsMane> But I talked myself into going into the office.
[19:54:05] <grape> too much stress?
[19:54:16] <LionsMane> The depression.
[19:54:25] <grape> :-(
[19:54:41] <grape> I am usually better here once spring is around
[19:56:25] <grape> what do you do against that? for me my garden works wonders here...
[20:00:02] <LionsMane> My Dr said to try to exercise 20 minutes, three times a week.
[20:00:19] <LionsMane> And we are working thru the issues of what triggered the depression.
[20:00:30] <LionsMane> OK, Sprint Retro, bbl
[20:00:55] <LionsMane> Actually, screw, I'll bing this laptop into retro.
[20:05:17] <grape> I get told that excercise is good as well... but then I cycle 2 x around 10 mins a day...
[20:05:22] <grape> and walk the stairs... etc
[20:05:23] <LionsMane> Anway
[20:06:11] <grape> how was your weekend?
[20:07:24] <LionsMane> Yeah, I could simply bicycle to work three times a week and that would satisfy his ask that I exercise for an hour, total, a week.
[20:09:47] <grape> the point is not to tick boxes.. the point is to get physically exhausted... 
[20:11:17] <grape> in this respect living in Graz was better for me... it is quite flat there so I could jump on my bike and cycle for 1h or so
[20:11:20] <grape> too hilly here..
[20:18:14] <LionsMane> One could argue that hilly could really tire you out, but only if one is willing to hop on the bike knowing that one would get hammered.
[20:19:51] <grape> the problem is the hills are right from the start... so my body is 'cold'...
[20:20:47] <grape> also.. my bike does not really have the right gears to do some of the hills.. and some of them are on a busy main road... so I don't really want to wobble around and struggle to go uphill...
[20:22:24] <LionsMane> Ah yea. 
[20:24:44] <grape> and yes, I am old.... 
[20:24:47] <grape> very old
[20:28:50] <LionsMane> Bah, just lazy.
[20:28:52] <LionsMane> hehehe
[20:28:57] * LionsMane runs and ducks
[20:28:58] <LionsMane> heheh
[20:29:02] <grape> is that not the same? :D
[20:34:38] <LionsMane> Very much different.
[20:34:46] <LionsMane> You can be lazy young or old.  
[20:35:23] <LionsMane> "Old Ed" was this guy that I used to bike with as a kid.  He was in his late 80s and he was still kicking ass and taking name.
[20:35:25] <grape> ok... 
[20:35:38] <grape> well...
[20:36:19] <grape> right... time for some food I guess... bbl
[21:04:53] <AcidJell0> oh this is terrible
[21:05:01] <AcidJell0> my mouse ran out of batteries

[21:34:03] <grape> how about feeding it with some cheese? :D
[21:36:33] <AcidJell0> ill try stuffing some cheese in its battery slot see if it helps
[21:36:36] <AcidJell0> got plenty of cheeses :)

[22:05:50] <LionsMane> If it is not plugged in, it'll go to sleep after a while.
[22:06:44] <LionsMane> I chat on my personal laptop, but I do MOST of my work on my work laptop.  Taht is part of the reason why I don't see messages from channel right away, i am not constantly looking at the machine with the chat window on it.

[22:08:29] <AcidJell0> me three
[22:08:40] <AcidJell0> i have my own laptop i have xchat on
[22:09:17] <AcidJell0> problem i have is the work laptop is infront of xchat laptop
[22:09:30] <AcidJell0> so i have to hug the work laptop to get my arms around to type
[22:20:30] <LionsMane> Yup, not exactly the same problem, but, in effect, the same.
[22:25:59] <grape> I don't do that at work... no time for me to chat... :-(
[22:26:15] <grape> the only time I am using IRC is if and when I need to pester the guys from central IT
[22:55:33] <LionsMane> That was way more phone conversation than I ever want to have.
[22:55:56] <LionsMane> And so boring and unwanted, but I have my old insurance number so the people that did my labs can get paid.
[22:56:17] <LionsMane> hahah you can pester us, grape,  we'll just give you the wrong answers.
[22:56:21] <LionsMane> :O
[23:14:41] <AcidJell0> sometimes i think i hear voices
[23:14:54] <AcidJell0> it just is one of the HDs seeking stuff
[23:21:38] <LionsMane> Oh lucky you.
[23:21:47] <LionsMane> I have committees in my head.
[23:21:59] <LionsMane> All fn telling me to do bad shit to people.
[23:32:04] <AcidJell0> are they in agreement ? or is there a few in there taking the opposition ? :D

[23:41:45] <LionsMane> That time, my phone rang.
[23:42:20] <LionsMane> I am tethered to my phone, and doesn't pass data and voice at the same time.  So if my phone rings, it stops any downloads I have going.
[23:42:56] <LionsMane> AcidJell0: The voices in agreement??!?!  Are you fucking shitting me??!  No they are not.  Not at all.  Usually not even a little bit.
[23:43:19] <AcidJell0> thats good :)
[23:43:24] <AcidJell0> if they agreed id be worried :)
[23:43:34] <LionsMane> I think it is the only thing that keeps me sane.  If they all spoke the same voice, trying to convence me in a single coordinated voice, fuck, I'd be doomed.
[23:46:52] <AcidJell0> indeed
[23:47:45] <AcidJell0> i can see two possible outcomes. 1. you either will turn into a postal worker 2. extremist churchie
[23:55:37] * LionsMane shudders at both defective options.
[23:55:38] <LionsMane> No
[23:55:40] <LionsMane> just 
[23:55:40] <LionsMane> no
[23:56:24] <grape> back
[23:57:29] <grape> you guys are so lucky... when I worked in oxford and done night shifts I had this french radio station in my head... and the guy was rattling on for ages!
[23:57:44] <grape> problem was: I don't speak any french at all!
[23:57:51] <grape> so I got no idea what he was on about
[23:57:52] <grape> :-(
