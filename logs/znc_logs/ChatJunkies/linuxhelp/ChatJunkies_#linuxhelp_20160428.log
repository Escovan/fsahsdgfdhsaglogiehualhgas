[00:12:38] <grape> only half?
[00:12:52] <lowkey> that's the part that surprised me too
[00:14:03] <lowkey> seriously the process is to nominate who will represent the party (democrat or republican) in the race, should we be shocked that party insiders try to have some influence over the process?

[19:48:27] *** Joins: LionsMane (~don@CJ-ifj.kbt.9.173.IP)
[19:49:06] <LionsMane> yup.
[20:39:09] <grape> hi LionsMane 
[20:46:31] <LionsMane> Howdy grape
[20:57:28] <grape> how are you?
[20:57:39] <grape> I am going to watch TV in 3 mins...
[21:00:30] <grape> bbl
[21:40:42] <LionsMane> So yeah.
[22:08:29] <grape> back
[22:08:40] <grape> LionsMane: what are Professional qualifications?
[22:12:11] * AcidJell0 wonders if grape has been in some sort of army regiment
[22:12:24] <AcidJell0> you can almost set your clock by grape 
[22:15:14] <LionsMane> Professional Qualifications?
[22:15:19] <LionsMane> Da Faq?
[22:15:36] <LionsMane> I don't bite people as often as I used to.  I can qualify that.
[22:23:38] <grape> I am filling in a form... and I am not sure what they understand about that
[22:31:40] <AcidJell0> not biting people would def. give me more confidence in hiring you
[22:32:50] <AcidJell0> altho i guess the Profesional term of that would be something like Biting engineer profesional
[23:16:10] <grape> where is lowkey?
[23:16:18] <grape> and is LionsMane still there?
[23:16:36] <LionsMane> Mostly
[23:16:39] <LionsMane> Sup dude
[23:16:45] <LionsMane> Better than being called a dud.
[23:16:46] <LionsMane> :D
[23:19:30] <LionsMane> grape: speak you salty dog!
[23:21:21] <grape> LionsMane: I have not taken a bath in the dead sea... so I am not salty! nor am I a dog! :D
[23:27:03] <AcidJell0> man
[23:27:07] <AcidJell0> im thoroughly pissed
[23:27:09] <AcidJell0> pissed
[23:27:24] <AcidJell0> its paycheck day
[23:27:27] <AcidJell0> and i got my bonus in
[23:27:32] <AcidJell0> ... great
[23:27:56] <grape> bonus? what is that??? :D
[23:28:03] <AcidJell0> yah ... exactly
[23:28:21] <AcidJell0> its an opportunity to contribute to taxes
[23:28:32] <AcidJell0> i got 20$ less then 50%
[23:28:45] <AcidJell0> i swear da f*king god its NOT worth working in this country
[23:29:14] <LionsMane> Why are pissed that you got a bonus, AcidJell0?
[23:29:47] <AcidJell0> im pissed because the government took it all
[23:29:53] <LionsMane> Anyway, grape did you have some questions for me?
[23:30:29] <AcidJell0> i have f*king debt i need to pay off and they take it, worse of all those fuckers in power are NOT even going to pay into the deficit
[23:30:35] <grape> yes... which was around 1 h ago... I asked about professional skills...
[23:35:05] <AcidJell0> omfg ... the bonus puts me in the next tax bracket ...
[23:35:45] <AcidJell0> which might be ok since im not going to gross into a new tax bracket, which might mean ill get some money back
[23:52:37] <grape> LionsMane: you got a sec?
[23:55:32] <LionsMane> grape: sure
