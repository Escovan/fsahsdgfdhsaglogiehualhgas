[00:00:40] <grape> and why is that lowkey ?
[00:05:55] <LionsMane> did you not see the conversation about windows trying to reconnect when the connection is refused.
[00:06:13] <LionsMane> Or the wallpaper being set to an off network resource
[00:06:18] <LionsMane> Or it just being windows.
[00:07:41] <grape> I saw some of it... though I don't understand the wallpaper issue... you are setting the hostnameas a wallpaper?
[00:13:24] <lowkey> no, the problem is that back in 2005 someone set the default system wallpaper to one stored on a network server that no longer exists
[00:13:50] <lowkey> the fact that windows allowed them to do it rather than requiring the image to be copied local is amazing
[00:15:26] <lowkey> i mean laptops never leave local networks.  it can never go bad.
[00:16:49] <grape> ok... now I got it
[00:16:59] <grape> sorry
[00:17:36] <lowkey> and its nice that windows has a history of all images you ever used but it would be really nice if you could right-click on any one entry and say "forget about this one"
[00:19:37] <LionsMane> hahhaha
[00:19:44] <LionsMane> yeah, I hear that.  Sounds good to me.
[00:19:49] <LionsMane> PATCHIT!  SHIPIT!
[00:20:59] <lowkey> I now know why windows administrators make such good money.  its not because they add real value but rather they know a few secret processes to fix windows when users fuck it up
[00:25:51] <grape> lol
[00:27:30] <lowkey> i'm seriously wondering if fixing this will require sacrificing a chicken and some serious voodoo
[00:28:08] <grape> mmmh.. chicken
[00:35:05] <lowkey> OK for methods tested and they all failed.
[00:35:23] <lowkey> so even the docs suck for this stupid little issue
[00:42:01] *** Quits: LionsMane (~don@CJ-ifj.kbt.9.173.IP) (Quit: Leaving.)
[00:42:51] <lowkey> I'll bet a quick grep search would find the offending string in some text file....if only windows had grep.
[00:46:47] <grape> is windows using text files as config files?
[00:46:59] <lowkey> for some things
[00:47:39] <lowkey> the problem is I have a registry key that I delete and it magically appears back
[00:48:00] <lowkey> generally that's a sign of a text file to restore it....
[00:48:42] <lowkey> well it could be more complicated but I seriously doubt someone wrote a binary app to put the value in the registry
[00:50:36] <lowkey> if it were stealing banking information then maybe it would be worth a better hack.  but this is applying a default wallpaper
[00:51:03] <grape> I stick to linux...
[00:51:23] <lowkey> some app made it easy for the user to do, so they didnt consider the implications of changing environments
[00:52:48] <grape> somehow I think linux is better in this respect... 
[00:53:12] <lowkey> compared to this Linux is insanely easy
[00:55:29] <grape> see
[00:55:36] <grape> I am too dump to use M$
[01:03:23] <lowkey> me too
[01:04:16] <grape> so... that code a friend of mine compiles and one of the test jobs fails
[01:04:38] <lowkey> i may have accidentally done it.   or whatever I did had to be redone X times to work
[01:04:48] <lowkey> but rebooting now to see if it holds
[01:05:22] <grape> ok
[01:08:24] <lowkey> ok it held.  I didn't do anything different so I think it might be a case of needing enough repetition that windows realizes you really want the change
[01:11:54] <lowkey> it really is amazing that windows kept trying to connect to a system that didn't reply so committedly
[01:12:21] <lowkey> you'd think the developer would put a failure check into the loop after X attempts
[01:13:39] <lowkey> on the plus side this got me off my lazy ass and I got wireshark working on this system (without needing to run it as root)
[01:15:11] <grape> do you need to be root do to that?
[01:17:37] <lowkey> as a general rule wireshark needs to be root for promiscious (sp?) mode on interfaces.
[01:18:11] <lowkey> but there are ways that parts of it have the necessary privileges and allow the user to do it as long as they are a member of the wireshark group
[01:18:31] <grape> ok
[01:18:46] <grape> as I don't think I am running it as root
[01:19:14] <lowkey> so once you know the trick, its easy to setup.  at most it requires logging out then in again.
[01:19:58] <lowkey> its the kind of thing I will probably forget how to do by morning.  thankfully there's a good wiki
[01:20:51] <grape> I found wireshark quite powerful... but I don't think I ever used its full potential
[01:21:02] <lowkey> the problem was that for a long time it was just easier to do sudo wireshark then figure out the right way
[01:21:53] <lowkey> I've come no where near its full potential.  not even close.  I dont think I've even dabbled with its wireless abilities
[01:22:55] <lowkey> ok, I was getting hits from the windows system every 5 minutes.  its been a half hour since the last ones were logged.  I think that counts as a potential solution.
[01:30:38] <grape> that sounds good
[01:30:42] <grape> right... bedtime for me
[01:30:50] <lowkey> yep :-)   
[01:31:06] <lowkey> sometimes the hard part is waiting to see if it happens again.....
[01:31:11] <grape> sorry I was not really chatty tonight

[19:47:30] <AcidJell0> yaay
[19:47:38] <AcidJell0> got this HD dock station
[19:47:45] <AcidJell0> pretty kewl
[19:48:01] <lowkey> that can be handy but its kind of so last decade.
[19:48:18] <AcidJell0> thats the point :)
[19:48:24] <AcidJell0> i had all these old HD's
[19:48:28] <lowkey> a USB hub can do almost all you need with only one cable to plug in
[19:48:36] <lowkey> ooops
[19:48:44] <lowkey> I read HP not HD
[19:48:57] <AcidJell0> now i can just buy HD's put stuff on them and interchange them
[19:48:58] <lowkey> i thought you meant laptop docking station
[19:49:05] <AcidJell0> its so easy, drive slides in 
[19:49:12] <AcidJell0> no
[19:49:17] <AcidJell0> USB HD Dock
[19:49:39] <AcidJell0> and this one does offline cloning
[19:49:58] <lowkey> I had a usb3 HD docking station that gave me a ton of errors on linux.  so I changed to one that connects directly to the SATA interface but still lets me hot swap drives.  very handy
[19:50:44] <lowkey> I use mine for monthly backups of a server.  slide drive in, run backups, slide it out then put drive in fire proof safe.
[19:50:53] <AcidJell0> thats what im thinking too
[19:51:05] <AcidJell0> i have tons of pictures and videos i dont know where to put
[19:51:18] <AcidJell0> now i can just throw them on a drive
[19:51:24] <lowkey> it may be the best on-site solutions I've ever used.
[19:53:27] <lowkey> that maybe a good solution too.  if you only need access to the photos & videos once in a while then why have the drive taking up a connection 100% of the time....
[19:53:54] <lowkey> plus drives don't fail while they're sitting idle in a box
[19:55:51] <AcidJell0> well
[19:55:52] <AcidJell0> funny
[19:55:59] <AcidJell0> i tried about 5 drives 3 of which just didnt work
[19:56:15] <AcidJell0> but ... i did get this 3tb wd green drive
[19:56:16] <lowkey> thats weird.  how old were the drives?
[19:56:27] <AcidJell0> judging by the size ... pretty old
[19:56:42] <AcidJell0> a seagate 250gb
[19:56:49] <AcidJell0> a seagate 120gb
[19:56:52] <lowkey> I haven't had a drive fail in storage for a long time.
[19:57:05] <lowkey> those might be old enough to test the limits
[19:57:16] <AcidJell0> and an ibm eserver 160gig
[19:57:25] <AcidJell0> naah ... really ?
[19:57:33] <AcidJell0> i thought hard drives will work forever no ?
[19:57:34] <lowkey> SATA interfaces? or IDE?
[19:57:38] <AcidJell0> sata
[19:57:57] <lowkey> I haven't had any SATA issues...
[19:58:02] <lowkey> IDE yes
[19:58:13] <lowkey> and old SCSI yes
[19:58:24] <AcidJell0> now heres the thing
[19:58:34] <AcidJell0> some of those drives i used were cheapo discarded drives
[19:58:43] <AcidJell0> i know at least one of them was bad
[19:58:49] <AcidJell0> but bad as in it had bad blocks
[19:58:52] <AcidJell0> not like brick
[19:59:00] <lowkey> hmmm
[19:59:18] <lowkey> can you reformat it or is it like a brick now?
[19:59:30] <AcidJell0> well this is what im wondering
[19:59:39] <AcidJell0> i stick it in the usb dock and windows does nothing
[19:59:55] <AcidJell0> i had one with reiser fs on it so windows said format it
[19:59:57] <AcidJell0> and it worked
[20:00:07] <lowkey> yeah but that's standard windows for drives with foreign filesystems
[20:00:24] <AcidJell0> right, but the drive itself worked
[20:00:33] <AcidJell0> where as the other 3 did not
[20:00:41] <AcidJell0> you can hear them turn but thats it
[20:01:50] <lowkey> hmmmm
[20:02:57] <AcidJell0> so
[20:03:01] <lowkey> well anything with moving parts will someday fail
[20:03:02] <AcidJell0> if you put stuff on a hd
[20:03:12] <AcidJell0> how long will the data last stored somewhere ?
[20:03:15] <AcidJell0> 50 100 years ?
[20:03:23] <lowkey> and depending on how they were stored...
[20:03:24] <AcidJell0> fail but out of use
[20:03:32] <AcidJell0> lets say they are stored propperly
[20:03:45] <lowkey> long term storage is a problem for almost everything
[20:04:06] <lowkey> thats why they are working on it so much
[20:04:25] <lowkey> I once had to recover files from tapes about 8 yrs old.  
[20:04:47] <lowkey> it was an experience that left me hating tapes for long term storage....
[20:06:16] <lowkey> even if you burn a CD, it will only last a few years statistically.  Individually you can see better but they all degrade with time
[20:06:58] <lowkey> the problem with hard drives is the axel.  if it loses lubrication then it can spin slower than it needs to read reliably
[20:07:30] <lowkey> and I've read where many SSDs are worse than moving platter HDs for long term storage
[20:08:04] <lowkey> even though they have no moving parts, they start to lose what it stored with time...
[20:10:26] <lowkey> part of the problem is interfaces.
[20:11:06] <lowkey> if you put away an IDE hard drive 10 years ago, do you commonly have any systems that have IDE ports to connect it to today?  No
[20:18:09] <lowkey> long term storage of data is dependent on rotating the data to newer media every so often
[20:18:34] <lowkey> or you can let someone else handle the media question and use a service like tarsnap
[20:18:54] <lowkey> just make sure you keep it paid up or they will delete your backups

[20:20:23] <grape> not too bad... got some things sorted... others I did not 
[20:21:06] <lowkey> that sounds like a good day  or at least as good as sysadmins can hope for  ;-P
[20:21:34] <grape> it was a good day

[20:23:46] <grape> I really would like to know why they are so keen on the cat
[20:25:13] <lowkey> some people are just wacky that way
[20:25:40] <grape> mh...
[20:25:51] <grape> because there is a DB running in the background?
[20:26:02] <grape> IMHO the implementation is flawed
[20:26:17] <grape> well.. the way it was set up I should have said

[21:19:21] <lowkey> you know its funny when someone uses the wrong email address for a financial account and you get spammed with all the emails about investment opportunities....

[21:25:24] <grape> phone
[21:26:06] <LionsMane> hahaha Indeed.
[21:32:42] <lowkey> or even notice that they dont get their "statement ready" emails once a month
[21:34:05] <LionsMane> Yanno, I don't trust my electric company.  They nag me to get ebills, and I don't think they can manage to send one every month.
[21:36:05] <lowkey> I can't wait for summer.  the residential neighborhoods in Denver get their power interrupted a few times during the summer because of peak usage.  and when they have an interruption longer than X minutes, they have to pay each household about $25. which is about what I pay for three months.
[21:36:31] <lowkey> so with a little luck, I wont pay an electric bill for 6 or 9 months
