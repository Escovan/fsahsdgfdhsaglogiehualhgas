[00:00:12] <grape> but I want to run it at user level... not as root
[00:00:38] <lowkey> https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/317  couple examples here but they specify root
[00:00:58] <lowkey> that just seems wrong to need to specify it
[00:02:10] <lowkey> https://amitksaha.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/managing-ipython-notebook-server-via-systemd-part-i/  here's an example of creating systemd files for another service that uses the User and Group tags
[00:03:02] <grape> great! thanks
[00:03:13] <lowkey> all the services I've created seem to run as root.  I may need to change that
[00:03:45] <grape> well.. it is not a good idea I think... specially as the program got access to the file system ... although it is a virtual machine... 
[00:04:02] <lowkey> thats probably a good point.
[00:04:15] <grape> ipython seems to be what I am using as well
[00:04:24] <lowkey> I may need to reduce the accounts used for some of these
[00:04:28] <grape> given it will be used by students.... ;-)
[00:05:42] <lowkey> they never find ways to abuse systems.  run everything as root.  use root as their default passwordless account!
[00:06:23] <grape> you think so?
[00:06:47] <lowkey> of course, there is the option to run a systemd service as a '--user' option.  that allows it to be run by each user that needs it
[00:07:15] <lowkey> grape: its what Microsoft has taught us.
[00:07:49] <lowkey> grape: and its what Qubes OS does..... although that's a single user OS really.  so less risk.
[00:07:57] <grape> I think I need to learn more about systemd
[00:08:32] <lowkey> systemd is powerful.  I always seem to discover new tricks that work well.
[00:09:51] <lowkey> for example, on my system I use an LCDd service to pipe output to a LCD screen that runs as root for hardware access.  Then as a user I run a service that outputs current email status to the LCDd service.  
[00:11:00] <grape> time! that is the key to all of that... I don't really have time to look into that in the depth I want to...
[00:11:27] <lowkey> thats the common problem.
[00:11:46] <lowkey> so many options to all the linux stuff that its hard to stay on top of it all
[00:12:48] <grape> true
[00:13:06] <grape> and if you don't know about them it is difficult to search the internet for them
[00:13:39] <lowkey> yep.  known unknowns are much easier to search for the unknown unknowns.
[00:14:42] <grape> hence I prefer to talk to people... ;-)
[00:15:50] <lowkey> its an issue that NSA GCHQ have run into.  hard to get the intelligence you need when you don't know what to look for
[00:16:47] <lowkey> partially blamed on their focus on technological methods rather than good old fashion human intel
[00:17:17] <grape> neuronal networks?
[00:17:26] <grape> this is what I am good at... my gutt feeling...
[00:17:39] <grape> right now it tells me: stop chatting to nice lowkey and go to bed
[00:17:45] <lowkey> lol
[00:17:52] <lowkey> it is bed time there
[00:18:41] <lowkey> sleep well grape!
[00:19:45] <grape> thanks lowkey ... and no offence... I really need some sleep..
[00:19:49] <grape> thanks for your help
[00:19:50] <grape> ttfn
[00:20:11] <lowkey> no worries.  I just got up from a nap  :-)
[00:20:22] <lowkey> g'nite grape 
[00:22:13] <grape> ttfn
